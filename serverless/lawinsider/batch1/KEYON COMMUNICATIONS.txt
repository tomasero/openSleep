The obligations of the Company and the Investor under the Purchase Agreement are conditioned, among other things, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Investor and the Company.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises and covenants set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

^Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

^^The term “Act” means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

^^The term “Form S-3” means such form under the Act as in effect on the date hereof or any registration form under the Act subsequently adopted by the SEC that permits inclusion or incorporation of substantial information by reference to other documents filed by the Company with the SEC.

^^The term “Holder” means any person owning or having the right to acquire Registrable Securities or any assignee thereof in accordance with Section 11 hereof.

^^The term “1934 Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

^^The term “register,” “registered,” and “registration” refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a registration statement or similar document in compliance with the Act, and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement or document.

^^The term “Registrable Securities” means (i) the Common Stock issuable or issued upon conversion of the Company’s Series Cal Cap Preferred Stock and (ii) any Common Stock of the Company issued as (or issuable upon the conversion or exercise of any warrant, right or other security that is issued as) a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for, or in replacement of, the shares referenced in (i) above. sa-60810 

^^The number of shares of “Registrable Securities then outstanding” shall be determined by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding that are, and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to then exercisable or convertible securities that are, Registrable Securities.

^^The term “SEC” shall mean the Securities and Exchange Commission.

^Request for Registration.

^^Subject to the conditions of this Section 2, if the Company shall receive at any time after the first anniversary, a written request from any Holder of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (the “Initiating Holders”) that the Company file a registration statement under the Act covering the registration of Registrable Securities provided that the anticipated aggregate offering price would exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]] then the Company shall, within twenty (20) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all Holders, and subject to the limitations of this Section 2, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as soon as practicable, the registration under the Act of all Registrable Securities that the Holders request to be registered in a written request received by the Company within twenty (20) days of the mailing of the Company’s notice pursuant to this Section 2.1.

^^If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 2 and the Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in this Section 2.1. In such event the right of any Holder to include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders and such Holder) to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders (which underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, if the underwriter advises the Company that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities underwritten (including Registrable Securities), then the Company shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated to the Holders of such Registrable Securities on a pro rata basis (as nearly as practicable) based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all such Holders (including the Initiating Holders), provided that no Registrable Securities shall be excluded unless and until all other securities of the Company have been excluded; and provided further that at least [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwriting are in fact so included. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from the registration.

^^In addition, the Company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this Section 2: sa-60810 

^^after the Company has effected two (2) registration pursuant to this Section 2, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective; 

^^during the period starting with the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of, a Company-initiated registration subject to Section 3, provided that the Company is actively employing in good faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; 

^^if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of Registrable Securities that may be registered on Form S-3 pursuant to Section 4;

^^if the Company shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration pursuant to this Section 2, a certificate signed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than 90 days after receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders, provided that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than once in any twelve (12)-month period and provided further, that the Company shall not register any other of its shares during such twelve (12)-month period; or

^^in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required under the Act.

^Company Registration.

^^If (but without any obligation to do so) the Company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its stock or other securities under the Act in connection with the public offering of such securities (other than a registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a Company stock plan, a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or other transaction under Rule 145 of the Act, a registration on any form that does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the Registrable Securities, or a registration in which the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration. Upon the written request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after mailing of such notice by the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.5, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be registered under the Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be registered.

^^Right to Terminate Registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 3 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Holder has elected to include securities in sa-60810 

such registration. The expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 7 hereof.

^Form S-3 Registration. In case the Company shall receive from Holders of at least majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding a written request or requests that the Company effect a registration on Form S-3 and any related qualification or compliance with respect to all or a part of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder or Holders, the Company shall:

^^promptly give written notice of the proposed registration, and any related qualification or compliance, to all other Holders; and

^^use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as soon as practicable, such registration and all such qualifications and compliances as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such Holders’ Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities of any other Holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the Company, provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance, pursuant to this Section 4:

^^if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the Holders;

^^if the Holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public of less than $[[USD Value 3: Number]];

^^if the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such Form S-3 registration to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer the filing of the Form S-3 registration statement for a period of not more than 90 days after receipt of the request of the Holder or Holders under this Section 4, provided, however, that the Company shall not utilize this right more than once in any six (6) month period and provided further, that the Company shall not register any other of its shares during such six (6) month period;

^^if the Company has, within the six (6) month period preceding the date of such request, already effected one registration on Form S-3 for the Holders pursuant to this Section 4; or

^^in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to qualify to do business, where not otherwise required, or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance.

^^Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities and other securities so requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the request or sa-60810 

requests of the Holders. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 4 shall not be counted as requests for registration effected pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3.

^Obligations of the Company. Whenever required under this Agreement to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

^^prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to 120 days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the Registration Statement has been completed; provided, however, that (i) such 120 day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holder refrains from selling any securities included in such registration at the request of an underwriter of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company; and (ii) in the case of any registration of Registrable Securities on Form S-3 which are intended to be offered on a continuous or delayed basis, such 120 day period shall be extended, if necessary, to keep the registration statement effective until all such Registrable Securities are sold, provided that Rule 415, or any successor rule under the Act, permits an offering on a continuous or delayed basis, and provided further that applicable rules under the Act governing the obligation to file a post-effective amendment permit, in lieu of filing a post-effective amendment which (I) includes any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Act or (II) reflects facts or events representing a material or fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement, the incorporation by reference of information required to be included in (I) and (II) above to be contained in periodic reports filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act in the registration statement;

^^prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;

^^furnish to each Holder (i) a draft copy of the registration statement, and (ii) such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and such other documents as it may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by it;

^^use best commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders, provided that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business, where not otherwise required, or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Act;

^^in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing sa-60810 

underwriter of such offering. Each Holder participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement. In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company’s capital stock, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holders’ securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and the underwriters selected by the Company and enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with an underwriter or underwriters selected by the Company. If the total amount of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other than by the Company that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the offering, then subject to Section 2 above, the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the securities so included to be apportioned pro rata among the selling stockholders according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included therein owned by each selling stockholder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by such selling stockholders);

^^notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Act, of (i) the issuance of any stop order by the SEC in respect of such registration statement, or (ii) the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing;

^^cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed; 

^^provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration; and

^^Use its best efforts to furnish, at the request of any Holder requesting registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration pursuant to this Agreement, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, or, if such securities are not being sold through underwriters, on the date that the registration statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the Holders requesting registration, addressed to the underwriters and to the Holders requesting registration of Registrable Securities, and (ii) a “comfort” letter dated as of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the sa-60810 

Holders requesting registration, addressed to the underwriters and to the Holders requesting registration of Registrable Securities.

^Information from Holder.

^^It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder’s Registrable Securities.

^^The Company shall have no obligation with respect to any registration requested pursuant to Section 2 if, due to the operation of Section 6.1, the number of shares or the anticipated aggregate offering price of the Registrable Securities to be included in the registration does not equal or exceed the number of shares or the anticipated aggregate offering price required to originally trigger the Company’s obligation to initiate such registration as specified in subsection 2.1.

^Expenses of Registration. All expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4, including, without limitation, all registration, filing and qualification fees (including “blue sky” fees), printers’ and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company (including fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company in its capacity as counsel to the selling Holders hereunder; if Company counsel does not make itself available for this purpose, the Company will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling Holders not to exceed $[[USD Value 4: Number]]) shall be borne by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 2, or Section 4 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all participating Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities that were to be registered in the withdrawn registration), provided, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business or prospects of the Company from that known to the Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness following disclosure by the Company of such material adverse change, then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to Section 2 or 4. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all expenses incurred in connection with a registration requested pursuant to Section 2 or 4, including, without limitation, all registration, filing and qualification fees (including “blue sky” fees), printers’ and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the selling Holder or Holders, shall be borne pro rata by the Holder or Holders participating in the registration.

^Delay of Registration. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement. sa-60810 

^Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this Agreement:

^^To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the partners or officers, directors and stockholders of each Holder, legal counsel and accountants for each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter, within the meaning of the Act or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a “Violation”): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws; and the Company will reimburse each such Holder, partner, officer, director, stockholder, counsel, accountant, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such Holder, partner, officer, director, stockholder, counsel, accountant underwriter or controlling person.

^^To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, on a several and not joint basis, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, any underwriter, any other stockholder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other stockholder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation (but excluding clause (iii) of the definition thereof), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.2 for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder (which consent shall not be sa-60810 

unreasonably withheld), provided that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 9.2 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder.

^^Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of actual knowledge of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 9, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 9 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission to so deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9.

^^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of and the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, provided that no person guilty of fraud shall be entitled to contribution. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The relative benefits received by the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to the net proceeds and underwriting discounts and commissions from the offering received by each such party. In no event shall any contribution under this Section 9.4 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder, less any amounts paid under Section 9.2.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. sa-60810 

^^The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 9 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement under this Agreement, and otherwise.

^Reports Under Securities Exchange Act of 1934. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the Company agrees to:

^^take such action, including the voluntary registration of its Common Stock under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, as is necessary to enable the Holders to utilize Form S-3 for the sale of their Registrable Securities, such action to be taken as soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal year in which the first registration statement filed by the Company for the offering of its securities to the general public is declared effective;

^^file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Act and the 1934 Act; and

^^furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC Rule 144, the Act and the 1934 Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form.
