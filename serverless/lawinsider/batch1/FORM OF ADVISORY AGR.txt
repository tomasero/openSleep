10.**ADVISORY FEE.**

^^The Advisor is not entitled to acquisition, disposition or financing fees.

^^The Advisor shall receive the Advisory Fee as compensation for services rendered hereunder. The Advisory Fee will be calculated using a detailed policy approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, and agreed to by the Advisor, which shall be consistent with the description of the calculation of the Advisory Fee as set forth herein. The Advisory Fee will be comprised of two separate components: (1) a fixed component in an amount equal to 1/365th of [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of NAV for each day (the “Fixed Component”), subject to reduction in accordance with Section 10(c) below, and (2) a performance component (the “Performance Component”) that is paid annually and calculated based on the Annual Total Return.

^^The amount of the Fixed Component that accrues each day shall be reduced by up to 1/365th of [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of NAV for such day, to the extent and in the same amount that the daily accrual of the Distribution Fee for such day is increased with respect to that portion of the overall NAV represented by Shares held by a Participating Broker-Dealer that meets certain thresholds of Shares under management. In all cases, the aggregate of the daily accrual of the Fixed Component and the Distribution Fee will total 1/365th of [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of NAV for each day.

^^The Performance Component will not be paid for any calendar year in which the Annual Total Return expressed as a percentage is less than or equal to [[Percentage 7: Number]]% (the “Priority Return Percentage”). The dollar amount of the Performance Component will equal [[Percentage 8: Number]]% of the difference between (i) the Annual Total Return and (ii) the amount required to provide Stockholders an Annual Total Return equal to the Priority Return Percentage. In no event will the Performance Component exceed [[Percentage 1]]% of the Annual Total Return for any calendar year. In the event NAV per share decreases below $10.00 on any day during the measurement period, any increase in NAV per share to $10.00 shall not be included in the calculation of the Performance Component. If the Performance Component is payable pursuant to this Section 10(d), the Advisor will be entitled to such payment even in the event that the Annual Total Return to Stockholders (or any particular Stockholder) expressed as a percentage on a cumulative basis over any longer or shorter period has been less than the Priority Return Percentage. The Advisor shall not be obligated to return any portion of any Advisory Fee paid based on the Company’s subsequent performance.

^^The Advisor shall, on a daily basis, (i) accrue a liability reserve account equal to the amount due for both the Fixed Component and the Performance Component, such accrual to be reflected in the NAV per share calculation for such day; and (ii) calculate the Annual Total Return, prorated as of the end of such day and, based on such calculation, adjust the balance of liability reserve accrual to reflect the estimated amount due on account of the Performance Component.

^^The Advisory Fee will accrue daily and is payable in cash. The Fixed Component is payable monthly in arrears (after the close of business and NAV calculations for the last Business Day for such month), the Performance Component is payable promptly after the audited financial statements for each calendar year become available, provided that if this Agreement or its term expires without renewal prior to [[Date 2: Date]] of any calendar year, then the Performance Component for such partial year shall be payable promptly after the Company files its unaudicted financial statements on Form 10-Q for the quarter that includes the Termination Date. The Performance Component shall be payable for each calendar year in which this Agreement is in effect, even if the Agreement is in effect for less than a full calendar year. In the event this Agreement is terminated or its term expires without renewal, the Advisory Fee will be calculated and due and payable after the calculation of NAV on the Termination Date. If the Advisory Fee is payable with respect to any partial calendar month or calendar year, the Fixed 

Component will be prorated based on the number of days elapsed during any partial calendar month and the Performance Component will be prorated based on the number of days elapsed during and Annual Total Return achieved for the period of such partial calendar year.

^^In the event the Company or the Operating Partnership commences a liquidation of its Investments during any calendar year, the Company will pay the Advisor its Advisory Fee from the proceeds of the liquidation and the performance component of the Advisory Fee will be calculated at the end of the liquidation period prior to the distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the Stockholders.

^^In lieu of cash, the Advisor may elect to receive the payment of any of its fees in Shares. Any such Shares will be valued at the Company’s NAV per Share on the issue date and will not be eligible for redemption by the Advisor until six months from the issue date.

11.**EXPENSES.**

^^As required by the [[Organization 4 Name]] Guidelines, the cumulative Selling Commissions, Dealer Manager Fees, Distribution Fees and Organizational and Offering Expenses paid by the Company will not exceed [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of Gross Proceeds from the sale of Shares in the Primary Offering.

^^^Organizational and Offering Expenses; provided that within 60 days after the end of the month in which an Offering terminates, the Advisor shall reimburse the Company to the extent the Organizational and Offering Expenses, Selling Commissions, Dealer Manager Fees and Distribution Fees borne by the Company exceed [[Percentage 9]]% of the Gross Proceeds raised in the completed Offering;

^^^Acquisition Expenses incurred in connection with the selection and acquisition of Investments, including such expenses incurred related to assets pursued or considered but not ultimately acquired by the Company, subject to limitations set forth in the Articles of Incorporation;

^^^the actual cost of goods and services used by the Company and obtained from entities not affiliated with the Advisor;

The Advisor shall prepare a statement documenting the expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership and the calculation of the Advisory Fee during each quarter, and shall deliver such statement to the Company and the Operating Partnership within forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter.

^^In lieu of cash, the Advisor may elect to receive the reimbursement of any of its expenses in Shares. Any such Shares will be valued at the Company’s NAV per Share on the issue date and will not be eligible for redemption by the Advisor until six months from the issue date.

12.**OTHER SERVICES.** Should the Board request that the Advisor or any director, officer or employee thereof render services for the Company and the Operating Partnership other than set forth in Section 3, such services shall be separately compensated at such rates and in such amounts as are agreed by the Advisor and the Independent Directors, subject to the limitations contained in the Articles of Incorporation, and shall not be deemed to be services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

13.**REIMBURSEMENT TO THE ADVISOR.** The Company shall not reimburse the Advisor at the end of any fiscal quarter for Total Operating Expenses that in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended (the “Expense Year”) exceeded (the “Excess Amount”) the greater of [[Percentage 10: Number]]% of Average Invested Assets or [[Percentage 8]]% of Net Income (the “[[Percentage 2]]%/[[Percentage 3]]% Guidelines”) for such year unless the Independent Directors determine that such excess was justified, based on unusual and nonrecurring factors that the Independent Directors deem sufficient. If the Independent Directors do not approve such excess as being so justified, any Excess Amount paid to the Advisor during a fiscal quarter shall be repaid to the Company. If the Independent Directors determine such excess was justified, then, within sixty (60) days after the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company for which total reimbursed Total Operating Expenses for the Expense Year exceed the [[Percentage 2]]%/[[Percentage 3]]% Guidelines, the Advisor, at the direction of the Independent Directors, shall cause such fact to be disclosed to the Stockholders in writing (or the Company shall disclose such fact to the Stockholders in the next quarterly report of the Company or by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission within sixty (60) days of such quarter end), together with an explanation of the factors the Independent Directors considered in determining that such excess were justified. The Company will ensure that such determination will be reflected in the minutes of the meetings of the Board. All figures used in the foregoing computations shall be determined in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

14.**OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISOR.**

^^**Relationship**. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Advisor or any of its Affiliates from engaging in or earning fees from other activities, including, without limitation, the rendering of advice to other Persons (including other REITs) and the management of other programs advised, sponsored or organized by the Advisor or its Affiliates; nor shall this Agreement limit or restrict the right of any director, officer, member, partner, employee, or stockholder of the Advisor or its Affiliates to engage in or earn fees from any other business or to render services of any kind to any other partnership, corporation, firm, individual, trust or association and earn fees for rendering such services. The Advisor may, with respect to any investment in which the Company is a participant, also render advice and service to each and every other participant therein, and earn fees for rendering such advice and service. Specifically, it is contemplated that the Company may enter into joint ventures or other similar co-investment arrangements with certain Persons, and pursuant to the agreements governing such joint ventures or arrangements, the Advisor may be engaged to provide advice and service to such Persons, in which case the Advisor will earn fees for rendering such advice and service.

^^**Time Commitment**. The Advisor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents to, devote to the Company such time as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct the business and affairs of the Company in an appropriate manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the Advisor and its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents may also engage in activities unrelated to the Company and may provide services to Persons other than the Company or any of its Affiliates.

^^**Investment Opportunities**. The Advisor shall use its best efforts to present to the Company and the Operating Partnership a number of potential investment opportunities appropriate for the portfolio of the Company and the Operating Partnership consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company, but neither the Advisor nor any Affiliate of the Advisor shall be obligated generally to present any particular investment opportunity to the Company or the Operating Partnership even if the opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Company or the Operating Partnership, could be taken by the Company or the Operating Partnership. In the event an investment opportunity is located, the allocation procedure set forth under the caption “Conflicts of Interest  Certain Conflict Resolution Measures  Allocation of Investment Opportunities” in the Prospectus shall govern the allocation of the opportunity among the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and Affiliates of the Advisor, on the other hand; provided any changes to the procedure shall be presented in advance and approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors.

15.**RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES.** The Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Advisor on the other, are not partners or joint venturers with each other, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to make them such partners or joint venturers or impose any liability as such on either of them.

^**THE CLARION NAME.** The Advisor and its Affiliates have a proprietary interest in the name “Clarion.” The Advisor hereby grants to the Company a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the name “Clarion” during the term of this Agreement. Accordingly, and in recognition of this right, if at any time the Company ceases to retain the Advisor or one of its Affiliates to perform advisory services for the Company, the Company will, promptly after receipt of written request from the Advisor, cease to conduct business under or use the name “Clarion” or any derivative thereof and the Company shall change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a name that does not contain the name “Clarion” or any other word or words that might, in the reasonable discretion of the Advisor, be susceptible of indication of some form of relationship between the Company and the Advisor or any of its Affiliates. At such time, the Company will also make any changes to any trademarks, servicemarks or other marks necessary to remove any references to the word “Clarion.” Consistent with the foregoing, it is specifically recognized that the Advisor or one or more of its Affiliates has in the past and may in the future organize, sponsor or otherwise permit to exist other investment vehicles (including vehicles for investment in Real Property and Real Estate Related Assets) and financial and service organizations having “Clarion” as a part of their name, all without the need for any consent (and without the right to object thereto) by the Company.

17.**TERM OF AGREEMENT.** This Agreement shall continue in force for a period of one year from the Effective Date, subject to an unlimited number of successive one-year renewals upon mutual consent of the parties. It is the duty of the Directors to evaluate the performance of the Advisor annually before renewing the Agreement, and each such renewal shall be for a term of no more than one year.

18.**TERMINATION BY THE PARTIES.** This Agreement may be terminated (i) immediately by the Company or the Operating Partnership for Cause or upon the bankruptcy of the Advisor or upon a material breach of this Agreement by the Advisor; provided, that such material breach is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice thereof by the Company or the Operating Partnership to the Advisor; (ii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice without Cause or penalty by a majority vote of the Independent Directors; or (iii) upon sixty (60) days’ written notice by the Advisor. The provisions of Sections 16 and 20 through 32 survive termination of this Agreement.

19.**ASSIGNMENT TO AN AFFILIATE.** This Agreement may be assigned by the Advisor to an Affiliate with the approval of a majority of the Directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors). The Advisor may assign any rights to receive fees or other payments under this Agreement to any Person without obtaining the approval of the Directors. This Agreement shall not be assigned by the Company or the Operating Partnership without the consent of the Advisor, except in the case of an assignment by the Company or the Operating Partnership to a corporation, limited partnership or other organization which is a successor to all of the assets, rights and obligations of the Company or the Operating Partnership, in which case such successor organization shall be bound hereunder and by the terms of said assignment in the same manner as the Company and the Operating Partnership are bound by this Agreement.

20.**PAYMENTS TO AND DUTIES OF ADVISOR UPON TERMINATION.**

^^After the Termination Date, the Advisor shall not be entitled to compensation for further services hereunder except it shall be entitled to receive from the Company or the Operating Partnership within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such termination all unpaid reimbursements of expenses and all earned but unpaid fees payable to the Advisor prior to termination of this Agreement, subject to the [[Percentage 2]]%/[[Percentage 3]]% Guidelines to the extent applicable.

^^The Advisor shall promptly upon termination:

^^^pay over to the Company and the Operating Partnership all money collected and held for the account of the Company and the Operating Partnership pursuant to this Agreement, after deducting any accrued compensation and reimbursement for its expenses to which it is then entitled;

^^^deliver to the Board a full accounting, including a statement showing all payments collected by it and a statement of all money held by it, covering the period following the date of the last accounting furnished to the Board;

^^^deliver to the Board all assets, including all Investments, and documents of the Company and the Operating Partnership then in the custody of the Advisor; and

^^^cooperate with the Company and the Operating Partnership to provide an orderly management transition.

21.**INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.** The Company and the Operating Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless the Advisor and its Affiliates, including their respective officers, directors, partners and employees (the “Indemnitees,” and each an “Indemnitee”), from all liability, claims, damages or losses arising in the performance of their duties hereunder, and related expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent such liability, claims, damages or losses and related expenses are not fully reimbursed by insurance, and to the extent that such indemnification would not be inconsistent with the laws of the State of Maryland, the Articles of Incorporation or the provisions of Section II.G of the [[Organization 4 Name]] Guidelines.

22.**INDEMNIFICATION BY ADVISOR.** The Advisor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Operating Partnership from contract or other liability, claims, damages, taxes or losses and related expenses including attorneys’ fees, to the extent that such liability, claims, damages, taxes or losses and related expenses are not fully reimbursed by insurance and are incurred by reason of the Advisor’s bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties; provided, however, that the Advisor shall not be held responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow any advice or recommendation given by the Advisor.

23.**NON-SOLICITATION.** During the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending one year following the Termination Date, the Company shall not, without the Advisor’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or encourage any person to leave the employment or other service of the Advisor or its Affiliates, or (ii) hire, on behalf of the Company or any other person or entity, any person who has left the employment within the one year period following the termination of that person’s employment the Advisor or its Affiliates. During the period commencing on the date hereof through and ending one year following the Termination Date, the Company will not, whether for its own account or for the account of any other Person, intentionally interfere with the relationship of the Advisor or its Affiliates with, or endeavor to entice away from the Advisor or its Affiliates, any person who during the term of the Agreement is, or during the preceding one-year period, was a tenant, co-investor, co-developer, joint venturer or other customer of the Advisor or its Affiliates.
