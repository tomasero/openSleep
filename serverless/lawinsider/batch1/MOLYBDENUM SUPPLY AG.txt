Buyer will pay an additional amount (the “Additional Product Price”) for Products that are supplied hereunder (as agreed to by Buyer and Seller as set forth herein) in a form other than TMO powder packaged in bulk super sacks, equal to Seller’s additional costs to (i) convert such Products from the form required to be delivered hereunder to such other form of Products, and (ii) package such other form of Product, *plus* [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of such additional cost.

^^ \centered 3.3**Entry into Other Supply Agreements**. If, during the Term, Seller enters into any other agreement or series of related agreements (a) pursuant to which Seller agrees to supply molybdenum products from the Mount Hope Mine to a third party prior to the Trigger Date or (b) having a term of one year or more pursuant to which Seller agrees to supply molybdenum products from the Mount Hope Mine after the Trigger Date, and in either case such agreement contemplates a floor price that is more than US${****} per pound lower than the Floor Price in effect in any month during the Term, then Seller will promptly provide Buyer notice thereof together with a copy of such agreement(s). Within 30 days of delivery of such notice, Buyer may, at its option, deliver written notice to Seller of its desire to amend this Agreement to provide for the same monthly floor price and all other financial terms and conditions as such new agreement(s), and the parties agree to cooperate promptly and in good faith to prepare and execute such amendment. If the parties are unable to do so within 60 days after delivery of Buyer’s notice of its desire to amend this Agreement, such matter will be resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 22. 

^^ \centered 3.4**Determination of Market Price****.** No later than [[Date 9: Date]] of each year during the term of this Agreement, Buyer will give written notice to Seller of the percentage of Product to be delivered during the following calendar year to which the pricing basis described in clause (a) of the definition of “Market Price” in Section 1.1 will apply, and the percentage of Product to be delivered during the following year to which the pricing basis described in clause (b) of the definition of “Market Price” in Section 1.1 will apply, which will aggregate [[Percentage 1]]%. 

4.**Deliveries and Invoices****.**

4.1**Delivery Point**. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all Products will be delivered to the Delivery Point. The Product Price calculations provided in this Agreement are on an FCA Delivery Point basis for delivery by Seller to the Delivery Point. Title and risk in each shipment of Products will pass from Seller to Buyer upon delivery FCA Delivery Point.

4.2**Invoices**.

^^^ \centered 4.2.1 On or after the earlier of Seller’s receipt of a bill of lading evidencing Buyer’s receipt of Product at the Delivery Point, and the end of each month, Seller will invoice Buyer by sending an invoice to the Competent Authority for the Product delivered (or for which Buyer is obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.4 during that month), and the corresponding Product Price. 

^^^ \centered 4.2.2 If at the time of Seller’s receipt of a bill of lading or the end of a month, the price for the Product sold has not been determined, Seller will issue a provisional invoice based on the average Product Price of Products delivered in the prior month in which the Product Price was known (a “Provisional Invoice”). If a Provisional Invoice is issued, Buyer shall pay [[Percentage 10: Number]]% of the amount of such Provisional Invoice pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2. Seller shall issue a final invoice as soon as the correct Product Price is known, which shall set forth the difference, if any, between the amount paid pursuant to the Provisional Invoice and the correct Product Price. To the extent that the actual Product Price exceeds the amount paid pursuant to the Provisional Invoice, Buyer shall promptly pay such difference to Seller. To the extent that the actual Product Price is less than the amount paid pursuant to the Provisional Invoice, such amount shall be credited against the amount owed by Buyer on the next invoice issued by Seller to Buyer. 

^^^ \centered 4.2.3 The amount shown on such invoice (or [[Percentage 10]]% of the amount in the case of a Provisional Invoice) will be due and payable by wire transfer to an account identified by Seller within 30 days of the issuance of the invoice. If Buyer fails to pay any invoice amount due pursuant to this Agreement on or before the applicable due date, interest on the unpaid amount at a rate per annum equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus [[Percentage 11: Number]]% will accrue daily from the applicable due date until the date the unpaid amount is paid and shall be due and payable at the time when the unpaid amount is paid or otherwise within five Business Days after demand by Seller therefor. 

4.3**Assaying Adjustments**.

^^^ \centered 4.3.1 Buyer has the right to appoint a neutral sampler (the “Sampler”), approved by Seller (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to take samples of the Products at the Delivery Point. In the event that Buyer determines that Seller has delivered non-conforming Product which should result in an adjustment to the Product Price (an “Assay Adjustment”), Buyer will notify Seller in writing of such determination (along with its results of analysis of such Product) within 60 days of delivery of such Product. Buyer and Seller will appoint a mutually agreeable third party to assist in the resolution of such matter (the “Referee”) within 30 days of delivery of such notice. If Buyer and Seller fail to appoint the Referee within such 30-day period, [[Organization 7 Name]] (or such other mutually agreeable third party, in the event that [[Organization 7 Name]] or its successor ceases to exist) will appoint the Referee at either Buyer’s or Seller’s request. The Referee will analyze the sample of such Product taken by the Sampler and the closest to the Referee’s results of either the assay set forth in the notice     

^^^ \centered delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Section 4.3.1, or the assay set forth in the relevant certificate supplied by Seller pursuant to Section 2.6 will be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller, in the event of a tie the Referee results will govern. 

^^^ \centered 4.3.2 The costs and expenses related to the procedures set forth in this Section 4.3 (including the costs of the Sampler) will be borne by the party whose results are furthest from the results of the Sampler. In the event that the results of the Sampler are exactly between those of Seller and the Buyer, each of Seller and the Buyer will bear [[Percentage 12: Number]]% of any such costs and expenses. For the purpose of the foregoing, the “results” of Seller will refer to the assay results set forth on the related invoice. 

^^^ \centered 4.3.3 In the event that the final determination results in an obligation on a party to pay additional amounts or to reimburse any sum, such payment or reimbursement will be settled promptly by credit or debit notes and the invoice following the final determination shall be adjusted accordingly. 

4.4**No Prejudice**. Payment of an invoice by Buyer does not constitute acceptance of the Products covered by such invoice and is without prejudice to any and all claims Buyer may have against Seller in connection therewith. Buyer will have the right to accept any portion of any shipment of Products notwithstanding that it may reject the balance thereof. Acceptance by Buyer of all or any portion of a shipment of Products will not constitute a waiver of any claim which Buyer may have regarding the Products.

5.**Term; Termination****.**

5.1**Term**. The initial term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and expire on the later of (a) the first date after the Bank Loan Maturity Date when the Buyer Ownership Percentage is less than [[Percentage 6]]% and (b) the date the Buyer ceases to guarantee the Bank Loan, unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Section 5; provided, however,this Agreement shall not expire automatically pursuant to subsection (a) if the Buyer Ownership Percentage is less than [[Percentage 6]]% due to a Change of Control or the occurrence of a Major Transaction.

Buyer will accept and pay for all conforming Products delivered in accordance herewith. Termination will be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the parties which have accrued prior to the effective date of termination. Sections 4, and through , inclusive, will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

6.**Indemnification****.**

6.1**Procedure**. If Buyer claims that any of the Products fail to conform with the Specifications or fail to be in compliance with all applicable laws (excluding claims relating to Assay Adjustments which will be resolved in accordance with Section 4.3), Buyer will notify Seller of its claim (“Claim”), and provide Seller with all relevant documentation of the Claim, no later than 60 days after the date of delivery of such Products. Upon receipt of a Claim, Seller will have the right to inspect such Products and all evidence of the Claim, and Seller and Buyer will attempt to reach an agreement as to whether the Claim is valid.

6.2**Remedies**. If it is determined by Buyer and Seller that the Claim is valid, Seller will elect one of the following actions to remedy the failure, and will deliver notice thereof to Buyer 30 days prior to taking any such action:

^^^ \centered 6.2.1 delivering to Buyer conforming Products to replace the nonconforming Products; 

^^^ \centered 6.2.2 refunding to Buyer the purchase price paid by Buyer with respect to the nonconforming Products in return provided that Seller will have the option to take possession of the nonconforming Products; or 

^^^ \centered 6.2.3 applying a credit to the next purchase to be made by Buyer hereunder. 

If, upon receipt of notice of the intent to take one of the actions above, Buyer instead desires Seller to take another action listed above to remedy the failure, Buyer will deliver notice of such desire to Seller. If upon delivery of such notice Buyer and Seller do not agree on the action to be taken, such matter will be resolved pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth in Section 22. The removal and replacement of nonconforming Products will be at Seller’s sole expense (including all costs of transportation, duties, taxes and insurance), and Seller will reimburse Buyer for all costs (including all costs incurred with respect to transportation, duties, taxes and insurance) incurred by Buyer in connection with the replacement of nonconforming Products.

If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the validity of a Claim, such matter will be considered a Dispute and will be resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 22.

6.3**Limitations**. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, AND MAKES NO OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY TYPE, WHETHER OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS.

6.4**Indemnification by Seller**. Seller will at all times defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless Buyer and its affiliates and their directors, officers, agents, employees, participants and assigns, from and against any and all Losses arising in whole or in part out of the willful misconduct and/or negligent performance of any obligations of Seller under this Agreement; provided,however, that Seller will not be required to indemnify any indemnified Person for any Losses to the extent resulting from the misconduct or negligence of such indemnified Person.

7.**Force Majeure****.** Neither Buyer nor Seller will be liable to the other for default or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder when and to the extent that such default or delay is caused by order, injunction or stay entered by any court with valid jurisdiction, war, civil commotion, strike, labor dispute, work stoppage or slowdown, storm, earthquake, explosion, insurrection, epidemic or quarantine restriction, fire, flood, act of God, the inability to maintain in full force and effect all permits required to carry out planned mining operations due to intervention of government or any other similar contingency beyond the reasonable control of the parties (the occurrence of any of the foregoing will be an “Event of Force Majeure”); provided, however, that no Event of Force Majeure will have occurred in the event of a strike, labor dispute, work stoppage or slowdown initiated by, or involving only, workers or employees within Seller’s organization. The occurrence of an Event of Force Majeure will not terminate this Agreement, absent the written consent of the parties otherwise; provided*,* however, that Buyer may, at its option, terminate this Agreement if an Event of Force Majeure prevents, or Buyer reasonably anticipates that it will prevent, Seller from meeting its obligations in whole or in substantial part under this Agreement for more than ninety consecutive days during the Term. Both Seller and Buyer will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to avoid the occurrence and remove the causes of an Event of Force Majeure and to continue performance of their respective obligations hereunder promptly following the removal of such causes. If an Event of Force Majeure prevents a party from meeting its obligations hereunder in part, but not in whole, the parties will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to equitably adjust the parties’ respective obligations hereunder consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes hereof. Should Seller invoke force majeure conditions, the Buyer will be entitled to obtain from alternative sources such Products as it reasonably requires during the period that Events of Force Majeure subsist, and the quantities Products obtained under such conditions will be deducted from the amount of Products Buyer is required to purchase hereunder.

^^^^^^ \centered 8.3.2 limit access to the other party’s Confidential Information to its employees and representatives who require access to such Confidential Information for the purposes of performing its obligations hereunder and who have agreed to be bound by the terms of this Section 8; and 
^^^^^^ 
^^^^^^ \centered 8.3.3 refrain from any action or conduct which might reasonably or foreseeably be expected to compromise the confidential, privileged or proprietary nature of the other party’s Confidential Information. 
^^^^^^ 
^^^^ \centered 8.4 Each of Seller and Buyer will comply with reasonable requests made by the other from time to time regarding the protection of the confidential, privileged and proprietary nature of the other party’s Confidential Information. Upon the written request of either party, the other party will promptly return to the requesting party all of the requesting party’s Confidential Information, including any and all copies and summaries thereof, in each case in any format (whether written, electronic or otherwise). 

^^^^ \centered 8.5 For purposes of this Section 8, the term the “Seller” will include all Affiliates of Seller, and the term “Buyer” will include all Affiliates of Buyer. Nothing in this Section 8 will operate to prevent a party from disclosing such information as is required by
