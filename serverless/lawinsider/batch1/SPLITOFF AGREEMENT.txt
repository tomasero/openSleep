^^**Purchase for Investment**. Buyer is financially able to bear the economic risks of acquiring the Shares and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and has no need for liquidity in his investment in the Shares.

AS A PRECONDITION TO ANY SUCH TRANSFER, THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES SHALL BE FURNISHED WITH AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OPINING AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF EXEMPTIONS FROM SUCH REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION AND/OR SUCH OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY BE SATISFACTORY THERETO THAT ANY SUCH TRANSFER WILL NOT VIOLATE THE SECURITIES LAWS.

If any claim or liability (a “Third-Party Claim”) should be asserted against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties (the “Indemnitee”) by a third party after the Closing for which the Buyer has an indemnification obligation under the terms of **Section** [12.1](#_Ref200432885), then the Indemnitee shall notify Buyer (the “Indemnitor”) within 20 days after the Third-Party Claim is asserted by a third party (said notification being referred to as a “Claim Notice”) and give the Indemnitor a reasonable opportunity to take part in any examination of the books and records of the Indemnitee relating to such Third-Party Claim and to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim and in connection therewith and to conduct any proceedings or negotiations relating thereto and necessary or appropriate to defend the Indemnitee and/or settle the Third-Party Claim. The expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) of all negotiations, proceedings, contests, lawsuits or settlements with respect to any Third-Party Claim shall be borne by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor agrees to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim in writing within 20 days after the Claim Notice of such Third-Party Claim has been delivered, through counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee, then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to control the conduct of such defense, and any decision to settle such Third-Party Claim, and shall be responsible for any expenses of the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim so long as the Indemnitor continues such defense until the final resolution of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall be responsible for paying all settlements made or judgments entered with respect to any Third-Party Claim the defense of which has been assumed by the Indemnitors. Except as provided on subsection (b) below, both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee must approve any settlement of a Third-Party Claim. A failure by the Indemnitee to timely give the Claim Notice shall not excuse Indemnitor from any indemnification liability except only to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure.

^^**Failure to Defend**. If the Indemnitor shall not agree to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim in writing within 20 days after the Claim Notice of such Third-Party Claim has been delivered, or shall fail to continue such defense until the final resolution of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnitee may defend against such Third-Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate and the Indemnitee may settle such Third-Party Claim, in its sole discretion, on such terms as it may deem appropriate. The Indemnitor shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount of all settlement payments and expenses, legal and otherwise, incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim. If no settlement of such Third-Party Claim is made, then the Indemnitor shall satisfy any judgment rendered with respect to such Third-Party Claim before the Indemnitee is required to do so, and pay all expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the Indemnitee in the defense against such Third-Party Claim.

^^**Non-Third-Party Claims**. Upon discovery of any claim for which Buyer has an indemnification obligation under the terms of **Section** [12.1](#_Ref200432885) which does not involve a claim by a third party against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall give prompt notice to Buyer of such claim and, in any case, shall give Buyer such notice within 30 days of such discovery. A failure by Indemnitee to timely give the foregoing notice to Buyer shall not excuse Buyer from any indemnification liability except to the extent that Buyer is materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure.

^^**Survival**. Except as otherwise provided in this **Section** [12.4](#_Ref200433008), all representations and warranties made by Buyer, Split-Off Subsidiary and Seller in connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the liability of all Indemnitors under this [XII](#_Ref200433399) shall terminate on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, except with respect to (a) liability for any item as to which, prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, any Indemnitee shall have asserted a Claim in writing, which Claim shall identify its basis with reasonable specificity, in which case the liability for such Claim shall continue until it shall have been finally settled, decided or adjudicated, (b) liability of any party for Losses for which such party has an indemnification obligation, incurred as a result of such party’s breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed by such party after the Closing, (c) liability of Buyer for Losses incurred by Seller Indemnified Party due to breaches of its representations and warranties in [IV](#_Ref200432587) of this Agreement, and (d) liability of Buyer for Losses arising out of Third-Party Claims for which Buyer have an indemnification obligation, which liability shall survive until the statute of limitation applicable to any third party’s right to assert a Third-Party Claim bars assertion of such claim.

^^**Section Headings and Gender**. The Section headings used herein are inserted for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

^^**Specific Performance; Remedies**.

Accordingly, each of Seller, Buyer and Split-Off Subsidiary agrees that Seller will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms and provisions in any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, subject to **Section** [13.8](#_Ref200433065), in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights, obligations and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights, obligations or remedies otherwise available at law or in equity, and nothing herein will be considered an election of remedies. 

^^**Submission to Jurisdiction; Process Agent; No Jury Trial**.

^^Each party to the Agreement hereby submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action may be heard and determined in any such court. Each party to the Agreement also agrees not to bring any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each party to the Agreement agrees that a final judgment in any action so brought will be conclusive and may be enforced by action on the judgment or in any other manner provided at law or in equity. Each party to the Agreement waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto.

^^EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RIGHTS TO JURY TRIAL OF ANY DISPUTE BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS AMONG THEM RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of any and all actions that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of the transactions, including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. Each party to the Agreement hereby acknowledges that this waiver is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship and that they will continue to rely on the waiver in their related future dealings. Each party to the Agreement further represents and warrants that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel, and that each knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER WILL APPLY TO ANY AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO. In the event of commencement of any action, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to trial by a court.

^^**Construction**. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign law will be deemed also to refer to law as amended and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The words “include,” “includes,” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by “without limitation.” The words “this Agreement,” “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereunder,” and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If any party hereto has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which that party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that such party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.
