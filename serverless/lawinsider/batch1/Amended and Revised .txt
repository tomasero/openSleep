Subject to the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, the number, classification, and terms of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the procedures to elect directors, to remove directors, and to fill vacancies in the Board of Directors shall be as follows:

^^Unless otherwise provided in the Charter, the number of directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by the Board of Directors by a resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors serving at the time of that vote. Except in the event of a vacancy contemplated by **Section 1(c)** of this **Article I,** in no event shall the number of directors that constitute the whole Board of Directors be fewer than three. No decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation otherwise provide. Unless otherwise provided in the Charter, directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Florida.

^^The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II, and Class III, respectively, all as nearly equal in number as possible, with each director then in office receiving the classification that at least a majority of the Board of Directors designates. The initial term of office of directors of Class I shall expire at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation in 2010, of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation in 2011, and of Class III shall expire at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation in 2012, and in all cases as to each director until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. At each annual meeting of shareholders beginning with the annual meeting of shareholders in 2010, each di rector elected to succeed a director whose term is then expiring shall hold his office until the second annual meeting of shareholders after his election and until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of directors that constitutes the whole Board of Directors is changed as permitted by this Article I, the majority of the whole Board of Directors that adopts the change shall also fix and determine the number of directors comprising each class; provided, however, that any increase or decrease in the number of directors shall be apportioned among the classes as equally as possible.

^^Vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office may be filled by no less than a majority vote of the remaining directors (or, if only one director remains, the vote of such director) then in office, though less than a quorum. Each director so chosen shall represent the same class or classes of shareholders that such vacant directorship had represented, and each director so chosen shall also receive the classification of such vacant directorship to which he has been appointed.

^^A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon at an annual or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose or (ii) the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of one or more directors by the shareholders; provided, that the Board of Directors may not fill more than two such directorships during the period between any two successive annual meetings of shareholders. Any newly created directorship shall receive the classification that at least a majority of the Board of Directors designates.

^^A director of any class of directors of the Corporation may be removed before the expiration date of that director’s term of office, by an affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the votes of the outstanding shares of the class or classes or series of stock then entitled to be voted at an election of directors of that class or series, voting together as a single class, cast at the annual meeting of shareholders or at any special meeting of shareholders called by a majority of the whole Board of Directors for this purpose.
