BAKERSFIELD, CA, [[Date 1: [[Organization 1 Name]] (NYSE AMEX-TIV) announced today that it executed a Securities Purchase Agreement on [[Date 1]], with a group of institutional investors to purchase $[[USD Value 2]] million of its common stock and warrants in a registered direct offering of securities. Net proceeds from this offering will be used to drill a horizontal injector well to evaluate Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) at its Pleasant Valley heavy oil project at Oxnard, California, for future use in the development and production of heavy oil reserves. Tri-Valley will use the remaining proceeds for start-up operations of existing wells and production facilities on its Claflin property near Bakersfield, California, and for working capital purposes.

Under the terms of the definitive agreements, the investors purchased [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of Tri-Valley's common stock at $[[USD Value 3: Number]] per share, for a total of $[[USD Value 2]] million in gross proceeds, and received warrants to purchase up to [[Shares 2: Number]] shares (the "Warrants") in the aggregate.

All of such Warrants contain customary adjustments for corporate events such as reorganizations, splits, dividends, and the exercise prices of all such Warrants are subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of additional issuances of common stock below the exercise price then in effect.

The offering of the shares was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared effective by the SEC (file no. 333-163442) on [[Date 4: Date]].

**Recent Asset Sale**
