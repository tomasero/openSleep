The Target Aggregate Bonus amount set forth in each Participant’s Award Agreement shall represent the aggregate amount of two separate bonuses: an Objective Bonus (under the Plan) and a Discretionary Bonus. 

^**Performance Targets for Objective Bonuses** 

The threshold, target and maximum Performance Targets for the 2010 STIP are set forth in Exhibit A to this 2010 STIP. 

^**Determination of Participants’ Aggregate Bonuses** 

The Aggregate Bonus payable to each Participant shall be determined on the basis of the extent to which the Performance Targets for the Business Criteria and that Participant’s Individual Performance Measures are achieved.

In order for a Participant to receive any payment with respect to the Participant’s Discretionary Bonus, the Participant must meet the standards established for the Participant’s position, which standards shall be one of the components of the Participant’s Individual Performance Measures. The determination of whether the standards established for the Participant’s position are achieved shall be made by the Committee, which (other than for the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer) determination shall be based on the recommendations of the President and Chief Executive Officer or other direct supervisor of the Participant. 

For levels of achievement between threshold and maximum, the Committee shall determine the Payout Percentage by interpolation.

^**Payment of Accounts** 

At the time the Committee makes the determinations described in Section 7, it shall certify, in accordance with Section 4.8 of the Plan, the amounts of the Objective Bonuses payable to Participants. The Committee shall, at the same time, determine the amount of the Discretionary Bonus payable to Participants. Payment of such bonuses (the Aggregate Bonuses) shall be made as soon as practicable following the Committee’s determination and certification, but in no event later than [[Date 7: Date]]. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Objective Bonus otherwise payable to any Participant under this 2010 STIP shall be subject to the adjustments, limitations (including the dollar limitation under Section 4.3 of the Plan), Committee’s discretionary authority to make downward adjustments and other terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. Any Discretionary Bonus otherwise payable under this 2010 STIP shall be subject to any adjustments, limitations, upward or downward adjustments in amounts and any other terms or conditions that the Committee may impose in its sole discretion. 

^**Effect of Termination of Employment** 

Except as otherwise provided in an employment agreement, memorandum of understanding, other contract between a Participant and the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or by the Committee in its sole discretion, the bonuses payable under a Participant’s Award will be forfeited, and the Participant will not be entitled to any bonus payments with respect to such Award if the Participant ceases to be employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for any reason prior to the date the bonuses payments under the 2010 STIP are paid to Participants. 

^Recoupment of Bonuses 

Any payment of an Objective Bonus, Discretionary Bonus or Aggregate Bonus under this 2010 STIP is subject to recoupment pursuant to the Corporation’s Policy Regarding the Recoupment of Certain Performance-Based Compensation Payments as in effect from time to time, and a Participant shall promptly make any reimbursement requested by the Board of Directors or the Committee pursuant to such policy with respect to any such bonuses. Further, each Participant shall agree, by accepting an Award under the 2010 STIP and executing an Award Agreement, that the Corporation and/or any of its affiliates may deduct from any amounts it may owe the Participant from time to time (such as wages or other compensation) any and all amounts the Participant is required to reimburse the Corporation pursuant to such policy with respect to the Award.
