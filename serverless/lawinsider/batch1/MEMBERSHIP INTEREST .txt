For purposes of calculating Closing Date Net Working Capital, Marshall Miller will also determine the final coal inventory on the Closing Date. Marshall Miller’s determinations of the amount of coal in stockpiles and in pits shall be final and binding on Purchaser and Seller unless the parties mutually agree to an adjustment due to an error in the third-party engineer’s calculation that is apparent on the face of such calculation. Purchaser and Seller shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of such third-party engineer.

^^Review by Auditor. If the Purchaser gives the Seller a timely Purchaser Objection Notice to the Closing Statements, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objection. If a written resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) days after the Seller has received the Purchaser Objection Notice, the issue(s) in dispute will be submitted to the Auditor for resolution, which resolution will be limited to determining whether Purchaser’s or Seller’ position is correct. The determination of the Auditor shall be set forth in a written notice delivered, as promptly as practicable after the issue(s) in dispute have been submitted to the Auditor, to the Purchaser and the Seller by the Auditor and will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each bear fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the fees and expenses of the Auditor for such determination. The Purchaser and the Seller will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Auditor to render its decision as promptly as practicable, including without limitation by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by the Auditor for information, books, records and similar items. 

^^Cooperation. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to each other in the preparation of the Closing Statements and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.5, including providing reasonable access to the books, records, work papers and personnel of the Acquired Companies.

Within three (3) Business Days after the calculation of Closing Date Net Worth and Closing Date Net Working Capital becomes final pursuant to Section 2.5(b) or (c): (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price, as adjusted for the Estimated Adjustment Amount, or (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Purchase Price, as adjusted by the Estimated Adjustment Amount, exceeds the Final Purchase Price. The amount of the payment pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 2.5(f) being referred as the “Adjustment Payment”, in either case, (x) together with interest on the Adjustment Payment at the Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment and (y) giving effect to any amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.4(g). As used in this Agreement, the term “Applicable Rate” means a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” as set forth from time to time in The Wall Street Journal “Money Rates” column.

The Seller has made available to the Purchaser a correct and complete copy of each written agreement listed in Schedule 3.15(ii) (as amended to date). With respect to any, such agreement(whether in the name of Seller or any other Affiliate of Seller): Seller further represents and warrants that (A) such agreement is legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and to the Knowledge of the Seller, is in full force and effect, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity; (B) such agreement will continue to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect on identical terms for the benefit of the Acquired Companies following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity; and (C) no party is in breach or default and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time would constitute a breach or default, or permit termination, modification, or acceleration, under such agreement, except for any such breach or default that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^Powers of Attorney. There are no outstanding powers of attorney executed on behalf of the Acquired Companies. 

^^Litigation. Schedule 3.17 sets forth each instance in which any Acquired Company (i) is subject to any outstanding Order, or (ii) is a party to or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be a party to, any Proceeding in, or before any court or other Governmental Authority of any federal, state, local, or foreign jurisdiction. 

^^Employees. 

^^Schedule 3.18(a) contains a complete and correct list of all employees of the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof and the current compensation rate payable to each such employee. No Acquired Company is bound by or subject to (and none of its assets or properties are bound by or subject to) any arrangement with any labor union and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no campaign to establish any such arrangement is in progress. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened labor dispute involving any Acquired Company, nor has any Acquired Company experienced any labor interruptions. To the Knowledge of the Company, no executive or group of employees has any plans to terminate employment with any Acquired Company. 

^^None of the operations of any of the Acquired Companies has ever involved a collective bargaining agreement or other labor contract; and none of the Acquired Companies or Seller have ever been a “signatory operator” under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of 1992 (26 U.S.C. Section 9701, *et. seq*., as amended). Neither Seller nor any Acquired Company is a party to any employment contract, severance, termination or similar agreement with any of its employees, officers, managers or directors or other agreement with any employee. No Acquired Company will be liable for or otherwise obligated to pay any stay bonus, change of control payment or similar Liability as a result of the consummation of the transaction contemplated under this Agreement. 

^^Each of the Acquired Companies is in compliance with all Laws pertaining to the duties and obligations arising out of the employer-employee relationship, including, without limitation, all Laws regarding the WARN Act, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, mine safety, workers’ compensation, federal and state Black Lung or occupational disease, except where such non-compliance would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^Employee Benefits. 

^^Schedule 3.19 lists each Employee Benefit Plan that any Acquired Company maintains or to which such Acquired Company contributes, or that Seller maintains or to which Seller contributes for the benefit of employees of an Acquired Company. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan required to be identified in Schedule 3.19: 

^^^Each Employee Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract, or fund) complies in form and in operation in all respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code, except where the failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^^Neither Seller, any Acquired Company, any ERISA Affiliate, nor any of their respective current or former directors, officers, Employee Benefit Plan fiduciaries, employees or any other persons, has engaged directly or indirectly in any “prohibited transaction,” as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to which any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate, has or could have any material liability. All contributions, insurance premiums and other payments required to be made to the Employee Benefit Plans (or to any person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been made or paid in a timely fashion. Neither any Acquired Company nor ERISA Affiliate has any material liability with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, other than for contributions, payments or benefits due in the ordinary course or for other ordinary course expenses under the Employee Benefit Plans currently sponsored by the Seller, any of the Acquired Companies and ERISA Affiliates. 

^^^Each such Employee Benefit Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan, that is intended to be qualified, is the subject of a determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it meets the requirements of Code Section 401(a) and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan. All such Employee Benefit Plans have been timely amended to meet the requirements of the Code and applicable regulations and guidance issued thereunder. 

^^^No Proceeding with respect to the administration or the investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits and processing of qualified domestic relations orders) is pending, except where the Proceeding would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^^No Acquired Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, is required to, nor has it or any one of them ever been required to, contribute with regard to a “multiemployer plan” as defined under Sections 3(37)(A) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, or Section 414(f) of the Code. 

^^^The Company has delivered or made available to the Purchaser correct and complete copies of the current plan documents and all amendments thereto and summary plan descriptions, the most recent determination or opinion letter received from the Internal Revenue Service, the most recent Form 5500 Annual Report, and all related trust agreements, insurance contracts, funding agreements and other material documents which implement each such Employee Benefit Plan. 

^^^The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any Continuing Employee to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment from the Acquired Companies or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any Continuing Employee from the Acquired Companies. 

^^^No payment due or to become due to any employee of an Acquired Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by any Acquired Company or ERISA Affiliate is or shall be an “excess parachute payment” under Code Section 280G. 

^^^With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan which is subject to Section 409A of the Code such plan has been maintained and administered in good faith compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance promulgated thereunder. 

^^Neither any Acquired Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains any Employee Benefit Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA.

Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20(a) hereto, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Proceedings against any Acquired Company under any Environmental Laws. 

^^Except as identified in Discharge Monitoring Reports for each NPDES permit as provided in Schedule 3.20(b)(i) and Schedule 3.20(b)(ii), none of the Acquired Companies nor any employee or agent acting on their behalf has sampled water anywhere on the Real Property for the purpose of identifying the presence of selenium which reveals its existence in excess of 5 micrograms per liter or 5 parts per billion. 

^^To the Knowledge of Seller, in submitting any application for a permit or for a renewal thereof, each Acquired Company or employee or agent acting on its behalf has submitted information in those applications which is accurate, complete and truthful, and when acted upon will support the permitting action sought of the agency. 

^^To the Knowledge of Seller, in submitting any application for a permit or for a renewal thereof, no Acquired Company nor any employee or agent acting on its behalf has submitted information in those applications which is in inaccurate, incomplete or untruthful, or has submitted information that is misleading, and which if known or revealed to the responsible agency will cause the denial of the permit being sought. 

^^Insurance. All material assets, properties and risks of each Acquired Company are covered by valid and, except for insurance policies that have expired under their terms in the Ordinary Course of Business, currently effective insurance policies or binders of insurance (including general liability insurance, property insurance, including commercial and underground equipment, business interruption and workers’ compensation insurance) issued in favor of an Acquired Company with responsible insurance companies, in such types and amounts and covering such risks as are consistent with customary practices and standards of companies engaged in businesses and operations similar to those of such Acquired Company.

The Seller and Company will give any notices to third parties, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Third Party Consents listed on Schedule 3.4. The Purchaser shall cooperate with the Company and use commercially reasonable efforts in seeking to obtain such Third Party Consents.

^^make any change in employment terms for any of the directors, officers, and employees of any Acquired Company outside the Ordinary Course of Business. 

^^Full Access; Confidentiality Agreement. 

^^The Company will, and the Seller will cause the Company to, permit representatives of the Purchaser to have full access at all reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of the Acquired Companies, to all premises, properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and documents of or pertaining to the Acquired Companies. 

^^The provisions of that certain letter agreement by and between the Company and the Purchaser dated [[Date 7: Date]] (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), shall continue to apply to the Parties as though all such Parties were original signatories thereto. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, the Parties shall continue to be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Purchaser shall return to the Company all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of “Evaluation Material” (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) that are in its possession.

No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section 6.6, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules or to prevent or cure any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by any Party on the date hereof. 

On or immediately before the Closing Date, the Seller and the Company may amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules to reflect any matter that arises after the date hereof that, if existing or known on the date hereof, would have been required to be disclosed in such Seller Disclosure Schedules (the “Updated Seller Disclosure Schedules”); provided, however, that no such amendment or supplement shall prevent or cure any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company on the date hereof solely for purposes of Section 8.2(a) hereof. As such, any Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be applicable to the Purchaser’s condition to close as set forth in Section 7.1 but in no manner shall be applicable to and shall be disregarded for purposes of Section 8.2(a). 

^^Exclusivity. The Acquired Companies will not solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the ownership Units or assets of any Acquired Company (including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange). The Seller agrees that neither it nor any of the Acquired Companies nor any of the officers, managers or directors of the Seller or any of the Acquired Companies shall, and that each shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives and agents not to (and shall not authorize any of them to) directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any offer or proposal for an Alternative Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information with respect to, any Alternative Proposal; (iii) engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Alternative Proposal, except as to the existence of these provisions; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract agreement or commitment contemplating any Alternative Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby. The Seller and each of the Acquired Companies will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Proposal. As promptly as practicable after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes would lead to an Alternative Proposal, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry. 

^^Insurance and Indemnification. 

^^Following the Closing, the Purchaser will provide, and will cause the Company to provide, each individual who served as a manager, director or officer of any Acquired Company at any time prior to the Closing Date with director and officer liability insurance coverage for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date that is no less favorable in coverage and amount than any applicable insurance in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

^^Following the Closing, the Purchaser will observe, and will cause the Acquired Companies to observe, any indemnification provisions now existing in the articles of organization or incorporation of any Acquired Company for the benefit of any individual who served as a manager, director or officer of such Acquired Company at any time prior to the Closing Date. 

^^Employee Matters. Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide each individual who is employed by any of the Acquired Companies on the Closing Date and who continues employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date (the “Continuing Employees”) with a position providing base pay that is at least equal to the base pay provided to such Continuing Employees by the applicable Acquired Company immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 6.9, however, will limit the right of Purchaser to terminate or suspend employment of any Continuing Employee after the Closing, subject only to the provisions of Section 6.10. For a period of at least twelve (12) months beginning on the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Continuing Employees, employee benefits and programs that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar either to the Employee Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to by the Acquired Companies (as the case may be) for employees of the Acquired Companies as of the date of this Agreement or to employee benefit plans and programs provided by the Purchaser to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser. Continuing Employees shall receive service and vesting credit under any employee benefit plans and programs of the Purchaser and its controlled group of corporations in which they are eligible to participate for any service with the Acquired Companies. For the entire calendar year of 2010, Continuing Employees shall be permitted to take earned but not taken vacation time-off as provided in Seller’s Vacation Time-Off policy. Continuing Employees shall also receive credit under any group health plan of the Purchaser and its controlled group of corporations in their initial year of eligibility for such plan for any co-payments, deductibles or other out-of-pocket costs already incurred by such employees under any other group health plan for such period. 

^^WARN Act. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.9, Seller agrees that prior to the Closing, and Purchaser agrees that for ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller or Purchaser shall not, or allow any of the Acquired Companies to, take any act or allow any failure to act that would be a violation of any WARN Act. 

^^Tax Matters. The Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for each of the Acquired Companies for all periods ending after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be consistent with past practice. In the case of Tax Returns for periods starting on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a “Straddle Period”), the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with an opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns no less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof. The Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, any changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Seller so long as none of such changes result in any additional material Taxes to the Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies (other than Taxes of the Acquired Companies for which Seller is responsible hereunder). The Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date (a “Pre-Closing Period”). The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser complete copies of such Tax Returns within thirty (30) days of filing, except for U.S. federal and state income and franchise tax returns. The Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) file any amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund in respect of a Pre-Closing Period, and the Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from the Purchaser, of any refund or credit with respect to Taxes in respect of a Pre-Closing Period. As soon as practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15) days after the Seller’s or the Purchaser’s request, as the case may be, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller or the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other data relating to the Tax Returns and Taxes of the Acquired Companies and shall provide such other assistance as may reasonably be requested, to cause the completion and filing of all Tax Returns or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any Tax Returns or taxable periods or to otherwise enable the Seller, the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies to satisfy their accounting or Tax requirements. 

^^Further Actions. For a period of twelve (12) months from and after the Closing Date, each of the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall change the name of INR-1 Holdings and INR-WV Operating to remove “INR” from the name. 

^^Transition Services Agreement. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser or the applicable Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the Seller or an applicable Affiliate of the Seller, on the other hand, shall enter into the Transition Services Agreement. 

^^Confidentiality; Non-Solicitation. 

^^For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to keep confidential and not use in any manner any and all confidential information relating to the Acquired Companies or the Purchaser that remains in or comes into Seller’s or such Affiliates possession; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude Seller from (i) disclosing such confidential information if compelled to disclose the same by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of any applicable Law (subject to the following provisions of this Section 6.14(a)), (ii) disclosing or using such confidential information if the same is in the public domain (other than as a result of a breach of this Section 6.14(a) by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller) or (iii) disclosing or using such confidential information if the same is acquired from a Person that is not known to Seller to be under an obligation to keep such information confidential. If Seller is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in a Proceeding) to disclose any such confidential information, Seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Purchaser of any such request or requirement so that the Purchaser may seek a protective Order or other appropriate remedy and waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.14(a). If, in the absence of a protective Order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Purchaser, Seller is required to disclose such information, Seller, without liability hereunder, may disclose that portion of such information which the Seller reasonably believes it is legally required to disclose.

^^any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV of this Agreement, which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been made as of the date hereof (as modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and as of the Closing Date (as modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules but excluding any modified, updated or supplemented items disclosed in the Updated Seller Disclosure Schedules); or 

^^any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Seller or Company in this Agreement; and

Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a “Seller Indemnified Party” and collectively, the “Seller Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

^^The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 8.2(a) and (b) that may be recovered from Seller shall not exceed the amounts then remaining in the Escrow Fund.

^^Indemnification Procedures. 

^^The obligations and liabilities of the Seller and the Purchaser under this ARTICLE VIII with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE VIII (“Third Party Claims”) shall be governed by and contingent upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8.5. If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the “Indemnified Party”), as the case may be, shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Seller or the Purchaser (each, the “Indemnifying Party”), as the case may be, notice of such Third Party Claim within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its respective obligations under this ARTICLE VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. 

^^The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives written notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party and the Third Party Claim involves money damages and not an injunction or other equitable relief that could have an adverse effect on the Acquired Companies and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII and agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of Article VIII, subject to the Indemnifying Party’s right to rescind its assumption of the defense and acceptance of liability of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in its sole and absolute discretion for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party’s possession or under the Indemnified Party’s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party’s possession or under the Indemnifying Party’s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by any party conducting the defense against such claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided, however, Seller shall have the right to settle any claim for which it is the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of any other party if such settlement provides for a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party, does not include any admission of culpability and involves only the payment of money damages. 

^^Determination of Losses. The Parties shall make appropriate adjustments for Tax benefits and insurance coverage in determining Losses for purposes of this ARTICLE VIII. All indemnification payments under this ARTICLE VIII shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price. The Purchaser will (and will cause the Acquired Companies to) use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under applicable insurance policies covering any Losses to the same extent as they would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification under this Agreement. In addition, the amount of Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement shall be net of the amount of any specific reduction to the Net Working Capital or Net Worth made prior to the Closing and attributable to the subject matter in dispute. 

^^Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of claims for actual fraud or breach of any Fundamental Rep: (a) the Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnification provisions in the ARTICLE VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the Purchaser agrees that its right to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall be limited solely and exclusively to the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Member of Seller shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party except for claims for intentional fraud by such Member. 

^^Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as provided below: 

^^by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser; 

^^the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Purchaser at any time prior to the Closing Date if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement (the “Termination Date”), by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 7.2 hereof, (unless the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date results primarily from the Seller or the Company breaching any of their representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement); and 

^^the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Seller at any time prior to the Closing Date if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 7.1 hereof, (unless the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date results primarily from the Purchaser breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement). 

\centered 9.2. 

Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other Party, except as provided in Section 9.3 herein; provided, however, (i) that the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 6.5 and Article X above shall survive any such termination; and (ii) that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach by such party of any covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement. If Seller elects the Reverse Break-up Fee in Section 9.3, Purchaser’s obligation to pay the Reverse Break-up Fee and Seller’s right to enforce that obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If Seller pursues the specific performance remedy in Section 9.3 then this Agreement shall remain in effect until the final resolution of Seller’s specific performance action.Break-Up Fee. If the conditions to Purchaser’s obligation to consummate the Closing (as set forth in Section 7.1) are satisfied (other than those conditions that can only be satisfied at Closing and that are capable of being satisfied at Closing) and the Closing does not occur (other than through the failure of Seller or the Company to comply with their obligations under this Agreement) within five (5) Business Days of Purchaser’s receipt of written notice from Seller that Seller and the Company are ready to consummate the Closing, at Seller’s election and in Seller’s sole discretion, Seller shall have the right to elect (1) to obtain specific performance as provided for in Section 10.12 of the Agreement and to obtain any additional relief provided for by law or equity, other than monetary damages; or (2) to require Purchaser to pay to the Company in immediately available funds on such fifth (5th) Business Day an amount equal to Seventy Five Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 10: Number]]) (the “Reverse Break-up Fee”). Seller shall notify Purchaser of its remedy election on said (5th) Business Day. If Seller elects to receive the Reverse Break-up Fee and it is paid in full, and only in such event, then (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates (each a “Purchaser Affiliate”), shall be subject to (nor shall Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of the Reverse Break-up Fee, and (ii) Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall be precluded from any other remedy against Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate, at law or in equity or otherwise, and none of Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate in connection with this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby. If Seller elects the specific performance remedy, but a court determines that Seller is not entitled to specific performance, then Seller shall be awarded the Reverse Break-up Fee. The parties hereto agree that the monetary damages that Seller will suffer as the result of the Closing not taking place cannot be measured with accuracy and that monetary damages alone will not make Seller whole. The parties hereto further agree that the Reverse Break-up Fee, however, represents a fair and reasonable estimation of the minimum amount of monetary damages for breach of contract that would result to Seller in the event of a termination by Seller pursuant to this Section 9.3 under the circumstances described in this last paragraph of this Section 9.3. 

^^Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Parties; provided, however, (i) Seller may notify the employees of the Acquired Companies, after consultation with Purchaser, contemporaneously with any public disclosure by Purchaser, and (ii) that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party will use its best efforts to consult with the other Parties prior to making the disclosure). 

^^No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that (i) the provisions in Section 6.8 above concerning insurance and indemnification are intended for the benefit of the individuals specified therein and their respective legal representatives and (ii) the provisions in ARTICLE VIII above concerning indemnification are intended for the benefit of the Persons entitled to indemnity thereunder. 

^^Entire Agreement. (a) This Agreement (including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other documents referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

Except for the express representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE IV, the Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, in respect of the Seller or any of its assets, Liabilities or operations, and any such representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed.

^^The Purchaser acknowledges that it has inspected and is knowledgeable of the coal reserves that are included with the Leased Real Property (“Coal Reserves”). Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article III, the Coal Reserves are accepted by Purchaser on an “as is” basis, there being no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to (a) mineability of the coal, (b) merchantability of the coal, (c) fitness for a particular purpose, (d) quality of the coal or (e) quantity of the coal. With respect to any projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of the Seller or the Company to the Purchaser as part of the express representations and warranties set forth in Article III, the Purchaser acknowledges that (w) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projection and forecasts, (x) it is familiar with such uncertainties, (y) it is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections and forecasts so furnished to it and (z) it shall have no claim against any Person with respect thereto other than a claim for actual fraud. 

^^Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Parties; provided that the Purchaser may assign this Agreement, without the approval of the Seller or the Company, to a Subsidiary of the Purchaser, provided that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto.
