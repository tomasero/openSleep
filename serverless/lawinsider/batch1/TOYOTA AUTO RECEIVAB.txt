^**Access to List of Certificateholders’ Names and Addresses**. The Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Owner Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor, as the case may be, within 15 days after its receipt of a request therefor from the Owner Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor in writing, a list, in such form as the Owner Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. If three or more Certificateholders or one or more Holders of Certificates evidencing, in the aggregate, not less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Percentage Interest apply in writing to the Owner Trustee, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates and such appl ication is accompanied by a copy of the communication that such applicants propose to transmit, then the Owner Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford such applicants access during normal business hours to the current list of Certificateholders.

The Owner Trustee and Paying Agent (and the Indenture Trustee, to the extent the Indenture Trustee is then making distributions to Certificateholders) are hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but such authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings, and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to any distribution (such as any distribution to a Non-U.S. Person), the Owner Trustee may, in its sole discretion, withhold such amounts in accordance with this paragraph (c). In the event that a Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith.

^**Method of Payment**. Subject to Section 9.01(c), distributions required to be made to Certificateholders on any Payment Date shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date either by check mailed to such Certificateholder at the address of such holder appearing in the Certificate Register or by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of any Certificateholder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written instructions at least five Business Days prior to such Payment Date.

If such entity shall publish reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this Section 10.01, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Owner Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect spe cified in Section 10.02.

^**Resignation or Removal of Owner Trustee**. The Owner Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby created by giving written notice thereof to the Depositor, the Servicer, each Rating Agency and the Indenture Trustee. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Servicer will promptly appoint a successor Owner Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to each of the resigning Owner Trustee and the successor Owner Trustee. If no successor Owner Trustee shall have been so appointed or shall not have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Owner Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Owner Trustee.

If at any time the Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.01 and shall fail to resign promptly, or if at any time the Owner Trustee shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Owner Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Owner Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Administrator may remove the Owner Trustee by written instrument to such effect delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee.

Any resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee and appointment of a successor Owner Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 10.03 and payment of all fees and expenses owed to the outgoing Owner Trustee. The Administrator will provide notice of such resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee to each of the Rating Agencies.

^**Successor Owner Trustee**. Any successor Owner Trustee appointed pursuant to Section 10.02 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Administrator and to its predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment under this Agreement, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Owner Trustee shall become effective and such successor Owner Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of its predecessor under this Agreement, with like effect as if originally named as Owner Trustee. The predecessor Owner Trustee shall upon payment of its fees and expenses deliver to the successor Owner Trustee all documents and statements and monies held by it under this Agreement; and the Administrator and the predecessor Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver such inst ruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor Owner Trustee all such rights, powers, duties, and obligations.

No successor Owner Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Owner Trustee shall meet the criteria for eligibility set forth in Section 10.01.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Owner Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Administrator will mail notice of the successor of such Owner Trustee to the Certificateholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and the Rating Agencies. If the Administrator fails to mail such notice within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Owner Trustee, the successor Owner Trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Administrator.

Any corporation into which the Owner Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee, shall be the successor of the Owner Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be eligible pursuant to Section 10.01, without the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, further, that the Owner Trustee shall mail notice of such merger or consolidation to the Rating Agencies.

^**Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee**.

If the Administrator shall not have joined in such appointment within 25 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a trustee pursuant to Section 10.01 and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to Section 10.03.

Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provision and conditions:

Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the powers and duties conferred thereto under this Agreement, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Owner Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Administrator.

^**Power of Attorney for Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee**. Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Owner Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name.

\centered ASSET-BACKED CERTIFICATE

THIS CERTIFIES THAT [[Original Trust Agreement]] is the registered owner of [[Percentage 3]]% of the nonassessable, fully-paid, fractional undivided beneficial interest in [[Organization 1 Name]] 2010-A Owner Trust (the “Trust”) formed by [[Organization 4 Name]].

The Trust was created pursuant to a Trust Agreement, dated as of [[Date 2]] (as amended and supplemented, including the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated as of [[Date 1]], the “Trust Agreement”), between [[Organization 4 Name]], as depositor (the “Depositor”), and [[Owner Trustee]], a national banking association, as Owner Trustee (the “Owner Trustee”), a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of which is set forth below.

It is the intent of the Depositor, [[Organization 2 Name]] and the Certificateholders that, for purposes of federal income tax, state and local income tax, any state single business tax and any other income taxes, the Trust will be treated as a division or branch of the Person holding the beneficial interests in the Trust for any period during which the beneficial interests in the Trust are held by one person, and will be treated as a partnership, and the Certificateholders will be treated as partners in that partnership, for any period during which the beneficial interests in the Trust are held by more than one person. For any such period during which the beneficial interests in the Trust are held by more than one person, each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a Certificate or any beneficial interest on a Certificate, agrees to treat, and to take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, the Certific ates as partnership interests in the Trust for such tax purposes.

^^^if the interests of the Noteholders are materially and adversely affected, the Holders of Notes evidencing at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of each materially and adversely affected Class of Notes, acting as a single Class but excluding for purposes of such calculation and action all Securities held or beneficially owned by [[Organization 2 Name]], [[Organization 4 Name]] or any of their Affiliates; and

^^^if the interests of the Certificateholders are materially and adversely affected, the Holders of the Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the Percentage Interest;

for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Trust Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders or Certificateholders under the Trust Agreement.

No amendment otherwise permitted under Section 11.01 of the Trust Agreement may (x) increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of payments on the Receivables or distributions required to be made for the benefit of any Noteholders or Certificateholders without the consent of all Noteholders and Certificateholders adversely affected thereby, or (y) reduce the percentage of the Notes or Certificates which are required to consent to any such amendment without the consent of the Noteholders and Certficateholders adversely affected thereby; provided, that any amendment referred to in clause (x) or (y) above will be deemed to not adversely affect any Noteholder if the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied in respect of such proposed amendment. No amendment referred to in clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence will be permitted unless an Officer’s Certificate has been delivered by the Servicer to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee certifying that such officer reasonably believes that such amendment will not materially and adversely affect the interest of any Noteholder or Certificateholder whose consent was not obtained.

The obligations and responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement and the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the payment to the Certificateholder of all amounts required to be paid to it pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the disposition of all property held as part of the Trust Estate. [[Organization 2 Name]], as servicer of the Receivables under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or any successor servicer, may at its option purchase the Trust Estate at a price specified in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and any such purchase of the Receivables and other property of the Trust will effect early retirement of the Certificate; however, such right of purchase is exercisable only after the last day of the Collection Period as of which the Pool Balance is less than or equal to [[Percentage 8: Number]]% of the Original Pool Balance.
