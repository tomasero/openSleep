^^No Requirement to Actually Obtain Funds. Notwithstanding the fact that the Interest Rate pursuant to the Loan may be calculated based upon Lenders' cost of funds, Borrower agrees that Lenders shall not be required actually to obtain funds from such source at any time.

^^Usury Limitation. If, at any time, the Interest Rate payable on the Loan shall be deemed by any competent court of law or any Governmental Authority to exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by any applicable Laws, then, for such time as the Interest Rate would be deemed excessive, its application shall be suspended and there shall be charged instead the maximum rate of interest permissible under such Laws, and any excess interest actually collected by Agent shall be credited as a partial prepayment of principal.

Each Borrower Party hereby agrees to indemnify Lender Parties and their respective officers, directors, agents, and attorneys against, and to hold Lender Parties and all such other Persons harmless from all Indemnified Losses resulting from any representation or warranty made by any Borrower Party or on any Borrower Party's behalf pursuant to this Agreement having been false when made, or resulting from any Borrower Party's breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, which indemnification is in addition to, and not in derogation of, any statutory, equitable, or common law right or remedy Lender Parties may have for breach of representation, warranty, statement or covenant or otherwise may have under any of the Loan Documents. This agreement of indemnity shall be a continuing agreement and shall survive payment of the Loan and termination of this Agreement.

^^Lender Parties' Consent. Except where otherwise expressly provided in the Loan Documents, in any instance where the approval, consent, or the exercise of any Lender Party's judgment or discretion is required or permitted, the granting or denial of such approval or consent and the exercise of such judgment or discretion shall be (a) within the sole discretion of a Lender Party exercising commercially reasonable credit judgment and (b) deemed to have been given only by a specific writing intended for the purpose given and executed by a Lender Party.

^^Enforcement and Waiver by a Lender Party. Lender Parties shall have the right at all times to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the Notes, and each of other Loan Documents in strict accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, notwithstanding any conduct or custom on the part of any Lender Party in refraining from so doing at any time or times. The failure of a Lender Party at any time or times to enforce its rights under such provisions, strictly in accordance with the same, shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to specific provisions of this Agreement or as having in any way or manner modified or waived the same. All rights and remedies of the Lender Parties are cumulative and the exercise of one right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any other right or remedy.

^^No Representation, Assumption, or Duty. Nothing, including any Advance or acceptance of any document or instrument, shall be construed as a representation or warranty, express or implied, to any Person by any Lender Party. Any inspection or audit of the Records of any Borrower Party, or the procuring of documents and financial and other information, by or on behalf of any Lender Party shall be for Lender Parties' protection only, and shall not constitute any assumption of responsibility by any Lender Party with respect thereto or relieve any Borrower Party of any of Borrower Parties' obligations.

^^Expenses of Lender Parties. Borrower will, on demand, reimburse Lender Parties for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lender Parties in connection with the closing of the Loan and the preparation, negotiation, amendment, modification, interpretation, administration or enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and/or in the collection of any amounts owing from any Borrower Party or any other Person to Lender Parties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and, until so paid, the amount of such expenses shall be added to and become part of the amount of the Obligations.

^^Attorneys' Fees. If at any time or times hereafter any Lender Party employs counsel to advise or provide other representation with respect to this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other agreement, document or instrument heretofore, now or hereafter executed by any Borrower Party and delivered to any Lender Party with respect to the Obligations, or to commence, defend or intervene, file a petition, complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings or to take any other action in or with respect to any pending, threatened or anticipated suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other agreement, instrument or document heretofore, now or hereafter executed by any Borrower Party and delivered to any Lender Party with respect to the Obligations, or to represent any Lender Party in any litigation with respect to the affairs of any Borrower Party, or to enforce any rights of any Lender Party or obligations of any Borrower Party or any other Person which may be obligated to any Lender Party by virtue of this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other agreement, document or instrument heretofore, now or hereafter delivered to any Lender Party by or for the benefit of any Borrower Party with respect to the Obligations, or to collect from any Borrower Party any amounts owing hereunder, then in any such event, all of the reasonable Attorneys' Fees incurred by such Lender Party arising from such services and any expenses, costs and charges relating thereto shall constitute additional obligations of Borrower payable on demand and, until so paid, shall be added to and become part of the Obligations.

^^Exclusiveness. This Agreement, the Notes and any other Loan Documents made pursuant hereto are made for the sole protection of the Borrower Parties, Lender Parties, and Lender Parties' successors and assigns, and no other Person shall have any right of action hereunder.

^^Waiver of Punitive Damages. EACH BORROWER PARTY AGREES THAT WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF SUCH PERSON ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL SUCH PERSON HAVE A REMEDY OF, OR SHALL ANY LENDER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, AND EACH BORROWER PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT OR CLAIM TO SUCH DAMAGES SUCH PERSON MAY HAVE OR WHICH MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN OR THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, WHETHER THE SAME IS RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION, MEDIATION, JUDICIAL PROCESS OR OTHERWISE.

^^Waiver and Release. Each Borrower Party (A) waives protest of all commercial paper at any time held by any Lender Party on which such Borrower Party is any way liable; (B) waives notice of acceleration and of intention to accelerate; (C) waives notice and opportunity to be heard, after acceleration, before exercise by any Lender Party of the remedies of self-help, set-off, or of other summary procedures permitted by any applicable Laws or by any agreement with such Borrower Party, and except where required hereby or by any applicable Laws which requirement cannot be waived, notice of any other action taken by any Lender Party; and (D) releases Lender Parties and their respective officers, attorneys, agents and employees from all claims for loss or damage caused by any act or omission on the part of any of them in connection with the Obligations or the Loan Documents, provided that such release shall not apply to acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Lender Party.

^^Limitation on Waiver of Notice, Etc. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any applicable Law expressly limits any waiver of any right contained herein or in any other Loan Document (including any waiver of any notice or other demand), such waiver shall be ineffective to such extent.

^^Additional Costs. In the event that any applicable Law now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Lender Party, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender Party with any guideline, request or directive of any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall (i) affect the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender Party of any amounts payable by Borrower under this Agreement (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of any Lender Party), or (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by any Lender Party, or (iii) impose any other condition with respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any othe r Loan Document, or (iv) affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender Party, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Lender Party of making, funding or maintaining the Loan or to reduce the amount of any amount receivable by any Lender Party thereon, then Borrower shall pay to such Lender Party from time to time, upon request by such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable to the extent such Lender Party is not compensated therefore in the computation of the interest rate applicable to the Loan. A statement as to the amount of such increased cost or reduced amount receivable, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by such Lender Party and submitted by such Lender Party to Borrower, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.

^^Illegality and Impossibility. In the event that any applicable Law now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Lender Party, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender Party with any guideline, request or directive of such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), including without limitation exchange controls, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender Party to maintain any Loan under this Agreement, Borrower shall upon receipt of reasonable notice thereof from such Lender Party repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of such Loan, together with all accrued interest thereon to the date of payment and all amounts owing to such Lender Party, (a) on the last day of the then current interest period applicable to such Loan if such Lender Party may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such day, or (b) immediately if such Lender Party may not continue to maintain such Loan to such day.

^^Assignments and Participations.

^Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Loan and the Note held by it); provided that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Pro Rata Share of the Loan of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $[[USD Value 8]]; (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee; (i v) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent, for its acceptance, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing fee of $[[USD Value 9: Number]] to be paid by Assignee; and (v) until the occurrence of a Default, Borrower shall approve the Eligible Assignee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

^Upon such execution, delivery, and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (ii) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

^Agent shall maintain at its principal office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a record of the names and addresses of the Lender Parties and the Pro Rata Shares of the Loan of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "**Register**"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and Lender Parties may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

^Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, together with any Note subject to such assignment, Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form as required by this Agreement, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to Borrower and each Lender. In the case of any assignment by Lender, within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Pro Rata Share of the Loan assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Pro Rata Share of the Loan hereunder, a new Note to the or der of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Pro Rata Share retained by it hereunder. Such new Note shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the Note so surrendered.

^Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons (other than any Lender Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Loan, the Advances owing to it and the Note held by it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including funding its Pro Rata Share of Advances) shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement; (iv) Borrower, Agent and the other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement; (v) no participant under any such participation sha ll have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Lender Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or release all or substantially all of the Collateral; and (vi) until the occurrence of a Default, Borrower shall approve the participant (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

^Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of any Borrower Party; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information received by it from such Lender.

^^Binding Effect, Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the respective successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. No Borrower Party has any right to assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

^^Entire Agreement, Amendments. This Agreement, including the Exhibits hereto, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, and the documents executed and delivered pursuant hereto, constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and may be amended only by a writing signed on behalf of the Borrower Parties and such Lender Parties as are required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

^^Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents shall be held invalid under any applicable Laws, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or such other instrument or agreement that can be given effect without the invalid provision, and, to this end, the provisions hereof are severable.

^^Headings. The section and paragraph headings hereof are inserted for convenience of reference only, and shall not alter, define, or be used in construing the text of such sections and paragraphs.

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

^^Permanent Financing; Guarantor Release. From time to time, certain Subsidiaries of Borrower may obtain permanent financing secured by real property owned by the applicable Subsidiary, whether from government entities, state or nationally chartered banks, or other lenders. In the event that a requirement of such permanent financing is that such Subsidiary may not guaranty obligations of other Persons, then Lenders are willing to release such Subsidiary as a Guarantor, conditioned upon reasonable restrictions on distributions to such Subsidiary and such additional items as Lenders may reasonably require to protect their interest hereunder.

^^Notices. Any notices or consents required or permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered (i) if delivered in person, when delivered; (ii) if sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, at the address set forth below (unless such address is changed by written notice hereunder), on the date three (3) Business Days after deposit in the mails; or (iii) if sent via nationally-recognized overnight courier service (such as Federal Express), on the date one (1) Business Day after deposit with such courier service:
