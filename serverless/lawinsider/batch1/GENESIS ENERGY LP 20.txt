^Amendment and Termination.  
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law:

^^**No Rights to Award.** No Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the 2010 Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.

^^**Withholding.** The Company or any Affiliate is authorized to withhold from any Award, from any payment due under any Award or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount of any applicable taxes payable in respect of the grant of an Award, the lapse of restrictions thereon, or any payment under an Award or under the Plan and to take such other action may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy its withholding obligations for the payment of such taxes.

^^**No Right to Employment.** The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company of any Affiliate or to remain on the Board, as applicable. Further the Company of an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the 2010 Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the 2010 Plan or in any Award agreement.

^^**Governing Law**. The validity, construction, and effect of the 2010 Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

^^**Severability.** If any provision of the 2010 Plan or any award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the 2010 Plan or any award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the 2010 Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or award and the remainder of the 2010 Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

^^**Other Laws.** The Committee may refuse to pay any cash under an Award if, in its sole discretion, it determines that the payment might violate any applicable law or regulation or the rules of the principal securities exchange on which the Units are then traded.

^^**No Trust or Fund Created.** Neither the 2010 Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any participating Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any participating Affiliate pursuant to an award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any general unsecured creditor of the Company or any participating Affiliate.

^^**Headings.** Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the 2010 Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the 2010 Plan or any provision thereof.

^^**Facility Payment**. Any amounts payable hereunder to any person under legal disability or who, in the judgment of the Committee, is unable to properly manage his or her financial affairs, may be paid to the legal representative of such person, or may be applied for the benefit of such person in any manner which the Committee may select, and the Company shall be relieved of any further liability for payment for such amounts.

^^**Gender and Number**. Words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender, the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

^^**Participation by Affiliates**. With respect to the Awards made to the employees of an Affiliate, the Company shall act as agent of such participating Affiliate. In this regard, the Company shall make payment with respect to such Awards directly to the participating Affiliate, which, in turn, shall be responsible for making the payments with respect to such Awards to its eligible employees.

^^**Section 409A Compliance**. The 2010 Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and any ambiguity is intended to be interpreted in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and related interpretive guidance issued thereunder. The payments under the 2010 Plan are intended to be short term deferrals that are exempt from the application of Code Section 409A and the 2010 Plan will be administered and interpreted to maximize the short-term deferral exemption to Code Section 409A. The portion of any payment under the 2010 Plan that is paid within the short-term deferral period (as defined in Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-1(b)(4)) will be treated as a short-term deferral and not aggregated with other plans or payments. Payment dates provided for in the 2010 Plan are deemed to incorporate “grace periods” provided by Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-3(d) and no Participant may, directly or indirectly, designate the taxable year of any payment made under the 2010 Plan.
