^^*Standard of Care.* IIFP shall perform the Services in accordance with Good Industry Practice.

^^*Capital and Operating Cost.* IIFP is responsible for all costs associated with locating, designing, and constructing the de-conversion facility and obtaining all necessary licensing and permitting for such a facility. IIFP is responsible for all operating and maintenance costs as required to support the ongoing operations of the de-conversion facility. 

^^*Access to Information.* IIFP shall provide information to LES on the technical aspects of the Services as reasonably requested by LES from time to time and the right to audit records and inspect the facilities at the noted demonstration reviews contained in Addendum 1, Article 3d.

^^*Waste Disposal.* IIFP is solely responsible for contracting with a suitable Waste Disposal Facility and ensuring that the DU is converted into UO or UO at the Lea County Facility and packaged and shipped in accordance with the Waste Disposal Facility requirements. The UO or UOshall meet the technical requirements imposed by the Waste Disposal Facility for acceptance at the time of shipment to the Waste Disposal Facility from IIFP. As the waste may not be immediately processed for shipment upon receipt from LES, the cost for waste disposal charged to LES shall be that fee established at the time of DU shipment from LES in accordance with Addendum 1, Article 3b.IIFP is solely responsible for performing the processing of the DUF6 and UF4 at the Lea County facility and shall not transfer the responsi bility to a third party. IIFP shall not dispose of the UF4 in any manner other than converting the material to UO or UO8. IIFP shall not utilize a third party to dispose of the UF4 material in any manner.

^^*Volume of UF4.* IIFP explicitly agrees that, to the extent any legal limit is established by local, state or federal authorities for UF storage, IIFP will fully comply with such limit. Additionally, IIFP explicitly agrees to limit the amount of IIFP produced UF4 stored on-site or at remote locations to 1.5 million pounds (or less if so required by regulation). If a volume of 1.5 million pounds is reached, LES shall stop all further shipments of DUF6 until the volume of UF4 stored on-site or at remote locations is reduced to 1.0 million pounds. IIFP agrees to provide timely and accurate reporting of stored UF4 quantities on a periodic basis to [[Organization 4 Name]]

^^*Title of DU and Cylinders*. IIFP shall take title to the DUF6 and cylinders at the time it is delivered to IIFP’s possession, and LES shall have no further liability or responsibility for the material. Delivery shall occur when the lifting gear is detached from the relevant cylinder(s) in order to load it on to a transport vehicle at the LES facility. LES shall have the option of re-purchasing empty cylinders from IIFP after their contents have been completely removed, cleaned, tested and inspected for re-use in accordance with the codes and standards applicable for re-use by LES, such as ANSI N14.1-2001 or later revisions. Cost for this option is provided in Addendum 1.

^^*Financial Responsibility.* IIFP shall take financial responsibility for decommissioning of its facilities as required under United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") licenses as a prerequisite to beginning the Services and as required during all operations over the life of the facility. IIFP shall provide evidence of this complete financial assurance upon the request of LES prior to receipt of DUF6 and typically on an annual basis, or as otherwise reasonably requested.

^^*Legal Compliance*. In rendering the Services, IIFP shall comply with all applicable State and U.S. Federal laws and regulations.

^^^*Insurance Coverage.* IIFP shall secure and maintain the following insurance coverage and shall add LES as an additional insured to each applicable policy prior to [[Organization 5 Name]] under this Agreement:

For DUF6 weight and enrichment levels accuracy is defined as that level required to meet applicable rules and regulations. This information shall include, without limitation, information, documents and materials needed to facilitate IIFP's negotiations with state, federal and other regulatory authorities for the construction of the de-conversion and fluorine extraction facility or to respond to investor or public relations inquiries. Notwithstanding the above, if, in its sole discretion, LES considers any information requested by IIFP under this provision to be commercially proprietary or sensitive, classified or otherwise protected as National Security Information (pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 95), it sha ll not be required to provide such information. Under such circumstances, the parties will cooperate in good faith to achieve an alternative means of complying with this provision, if possible. 

^^*DOE Cost Information.* LES shall provide IIFP with copies of all information, correspondence and cost estimates provided by or to the United States Department of Energy ("DOE") as related to DOE's estimated waste disposal cost should LES invoke the lesser cost option defined in Article 3.b of Addendum 1 for waste disposal to the DOE.

^^*LES Federal License Amendment.* LES will submit a License Amendment Request (LAR) to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for review and approval, subsequent to IIFP receipt of approval from the NRC to begin IIFP site construction. This LAR will request removal of Condition 14 of the U.S. NRC Material License SNM-2010 which prevents LES shipments of DUF6 to de-conversion facilities employing anhydrous hydrofluoric acid in the de-conversion process.

^Limitation of Liability.
