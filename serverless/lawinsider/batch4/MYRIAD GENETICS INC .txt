\centered Form of Executive Retention Agreement 

THIS EXECUTIVE RETENTION AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), by and between [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Company”), and (the “Executive”), is made as of [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Effective Date”). 

WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly-held corporations, the possibility of a change in control of the Company exists and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among key personnel, may result in the departure or distraction of key personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders, and 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued employment and dedication of the Company’s key personnel without distraction from the possibility of a change in control of the Company and related events and circumstances. 

NOW, THEREFORE, as an inducement for and in consideration of the Executive remaining in its employ, the Company agrees that the Executive shall receive the benefits set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation, those benefits in the event the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated under the circumstances described below subsequent to a Change in Control (as defined in Section 1.1). 

^Key Definitions. 

As used herein, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: 

^^“Change in Control” means an event or occurrence set forth in any one or more of subsections (a) through (d) below (including an event or occurrence that constitutes a Change in Control under one of such subsections but is specifically exempted from another such subsection): 

^^the acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) (a “Person”) of beneficial ownership of any capital stock of the Company if, after such acquisition, such Person beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) [[Percentage 1: Number]]% or more of either (i) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “Outstanding Company Common Stock”) or (ii) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the “Outstanding Company Voting Securities”); provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change in Control: (i) any acquisition directly from the Company (excluding an acquisition pursuant to the exercise, conversion or exchange of any security exercisable for, convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or voting securities of the Company, unless the Person exercising, converting or exchanging such security acquired such security directly from the Company or an underwriter or agent of the Company), (ii) any acquisition by the Company, or (iii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company; or 

^^such time as the Continuing Directors (as defined below) do not constitute a majority of the Board (or, if applicable, the Board of Directors of a successor corporation to the Company), where the term “Continuing Director” means at any date a member of the Board (i) who was a member of the Board on the date of the execution of this Agreement or (ii) who was nominated or elected subsequent to such date by at least a majority of the directors who were Continuing Directors at the time of such nomination or election or whose election to the Board was recommended or endorsed by at least a majority of the directors who were Continuing Directors at the time of such nomination or election; provided, however, that there shall be excluded from this clause (ii) any individual whose initial assumption of office occurred as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents, by or on behalf of a person other than the Board; or 

^^the consummation of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or share exchange involving the Company or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in one or a series of transactions (a “Business Combination”), unless, immediately following such Business Combination, the following condition is satisfied: all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, respectively, of the resulting or acquiring corporation in such Business Combination (which shall include, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or substantially all of the Company’s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) (such resulting or acquiring corporation is referred to herein as the “Acquiring Corporation”) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, respectively; or 

^^approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 

^^“Change in Control Date” means the first date during the Term (as defined in Section 2) on which a Change in Control occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if (a) a Change in Control occurs, (b) the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change in Control occurs, and (c) it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the “Change in Control Date” shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment. 

^^“Cause” means: 

^^the Executive’s willful and continued failure to substantially perform his or her reasonable assigned duties (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any failure after the Executive gives notice of termination for Good Reason), which failure is not cured within 30 days after a written demand for substantial performance is received by the Executive from the Board of Directors of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board of Directors believes the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive’s duties; or 

^^the Executive’s willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company. 

For purposes of this Section 1.3, no act or failure to act by the Executive shall be considered “willful” unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive’s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. 

^^“Good Reason” means the occurrence, without the Executive’s written consent, of any of the events or circumstances set forth in clauses (a) through (f) below. 

^^the assignment to the Executive of duties inconsistent in any material respect with the Executive’s position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the earliest to occur of (i) the Change in Control Date, (ii) the date of the execution by the Company of the initial written agreement or instrument providing for the Change in Control or (iii) the date of the adoption by the Board of Directors of a resolution providing for the Change in Control (with the earliest to occur of such dates referred to herein as the “Measurement Date”), or any other action or omission by the Company which results in a material diminution in such position, authority or responsibilities; 

^^a reduction in the Executive’s annual base salary as in effect on the Measurement Date; 

^^the failure by the Company to (i) continue in effect any material compensation, pension, retirement or benefit plan or program (including without limitation any 401(k), life insurance, medical, health and accident or disability plan and any vacation program or policy) (a “Benefit Plan”) in which the Executive participates or which is applicable to the Executive immediately prior to the Measurement Date, unless an equitable arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been made with respect to such plan or program, (ii) continue the Executive’s participation therein (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of the amount of benefits provided and the level of the Executive’s participation relative to other participants, than the basis existing immediately prior to the Measurement Date or (iii) award cash bonuses to the Executive in amounts and in a manner substantially consistent with past practice; 

^^a change by the Company in the location at which the Executive performs his or her principal duties for the Company to a new location that is both (i) outside a radius of 50 miles from the Executive’s principal residence immediately prior to the Measurement Date and (ii) more than 50 miles from the location at which the Executive performed his or her principal duties for the Company immediately prior to the Measurement Date; or a requirement by the Company that the Executive travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Measurement Date; 

^^the failure of the Company to obtain the agreement from any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as required by Section 7.1; or 

^^any failure of the Company to pay or provide to the Executive any portion of the Executive’s compensation or benefits due under any Benefit Plan within seven days of the date such compensation or benefits are due, or any material breach by the Company of this Agreement or any employment agreement with the Executive. 

In addition, in an effort to foster and retain the employment of the Executive following a Change in Control, the termination of employment by the Executive for any reason (except for those set forth in section 1.4(a)-(f)), or no reason, during the 90-day period beginning on the first anniversary of the Change in Control Date shall be deemed to be termination for Good Reason for all purposes under this Agreement; however, in the case of a termination of employment by the Executive pursuant to this paragraph, those benefits payable to the Executive under section 4.1(a)(i)(2) shall be reduced by one-half. 

The Executive’s right to terminate his or her employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by his or her incapacity due to physical or mental illness. 

^^“Disability” means the Executive’s absence from the full-time performance of the Executive’s duties with the Company for 180 consecutive calendar days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive’s legal representative. 

^Term of Agreement. This Agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall take effect upon the Effective Date and shall expire upon the first to occur of (a) the expiration of the Term (as defined below) if a Change in Control has not occurred during the Term, (b) the date 24 months after the Change in Control Date, if the Executive is still employed by the Company as of such later date, or (c) the fulfillment by the Company of all of its obligations under this Agreement if the Executive’s employment with the Company terminates within 24 months following the Change in Control Date. “Term” shall mean the period commencing as of the Effective Date and continuing in effect through [[Date 2: Date]]; provided, however, that commencing on [[Date 3: Date]] and each [[Date 4: Date]] thereafter, the Term shall be automatically extended for one additional year unless, not later than 90 days prior to the scheduled expiration of the Term (or any extension thereof), the Company shall have given the Executive written notice that the Term will not be extended. 

^Employment Status; Termination Following Change in Control. 

^^Not an Employment Contract. The Executive acknowledges that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Company any obligation to retain the Executive as an employee and that this Agreement does not prevent the Executive from terminating employment at any time. If the Executive’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason and subsequently a Change in Control shall occur, the Executive shall not be entitled to any benefits hereunder except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 1.2. 

^^Termination of Employment. 

^^If the Change in Control Date occurs during the Term, any termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company or by the Executive within 24 months following the Change in Control Date (other than due to the death of the Executive) shall be communicated by a written notice to the other party hereto (the “Notice of Termination”), given in accordance with Section 8. Any Notice of Termination shall: (i) indicate the specific termination provision (if any) of this Agreement relied upon by the party giving such notice, (ii) to the extent applicable, set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive’s employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) specify the Date of Termination (as defined below). The effective date of an employment termination (the “Date of Termination”) shall be the close of business on the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which date may not be less than 15 days or more than 120 days after the date of delivery of such Notice of Termination) in the case of a termination other than one due to the Executive’s death. In the case of the Executive’s death, the Date of Termination shall be the date of the Executive’s death. In the event the Company fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 3.2(a) regarding a Notice of Termination, the purported termination of the Executive’s employment pursuant to such Notice of Termination shall not be effective for purposes of this Agreement. 

^^The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting any such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive’s or the Company’s rights hereunder. 

^^Any Notice of Termination for Cause given by the Company must be given within 90 days of the occurrence (or if later, the discovery) of the event(s) or circumstance(s) which constitute(s) Cause. Prior to any Notice of Termination for Cause being given (and prior to any termination for Cause being effective), the Executive shall be entitled to a hearing before the Board of Directors of the Company at which he or she may, at his or her election, be represented by counsel and at which he or she shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Such hearing shall be held on not less than 15 days prior written notice to the Executive stating the Board of Directors’ intention to terminate the Executive for Cause and stating in detail the particular event(s) or circumstance(s) which the Board of Directors believes constitutes Cause for termination. 

^^Any Notice of Termination for Good Reason given by the Executive must be given within 90 days of the occurrence of the event(s) or circumstance(s) which constitute(s) Good Reason. 

^Benefits to Executive. 

^^Benefits. If a Change in Control Date occurs during the Term and the Executive’s employment with the Company terminates within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, the Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits: 

^^Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. If the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company (other than for Cause, Disability or Death) or by the Executive for Good Reason within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, then the Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits: 

^^^the Company shall pay to the Executive the following amounts: 

^in a lump sum, in cash, within 30 days after the Date of Termination, the sum of (A) the Executive’s base salary through the Date of Termination, (B) a pro rata current year bonus amount (calculated by dividing the number of full and partial months of the current fiscal year in which the Executive is employed through the Date of Termination by 12, and multiplying this fraction by the highest annual bonus payment amount paid to Executive in the preceding three years), and (C) the amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not previously paid (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (A), (B), and (C) shall be hereinafter referred to as the “Accrued Obligations”); and 

^in a lump sum, in cash, within 30 days after the Date of Termination, the sum of (A) three times the Executive’s highest annual base salary at the Company during the three-year period prior to the Change in Control Date and (B) three times the Executive’s highest annual bonus amount at the Company during the three-year period prior to the Change in Control Date; 

^^^for 36 months after the Date of Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue to provide benefits to the Executive and the Executive’s family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them if the Executive’s employment had not been terminated, in accordance with the applicable Benefit Plans in effect on the Measurement Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and his or her family, in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies; provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive a particular type of benefits (e.g., health insurance benefits) from such employer on terms at least as favorable to the Executive and his or her family as those being provided by the Company, then the Company shall no longer be required to provide those particular benefits to the Executive and his or her family; and 

^^^to the extent not previously paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive following the Executive’s termination of employment under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the “Other Benefits”). 

^^Resignation without Good Reason; Termination for Death or Disability. If the Executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment with the Company within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, excluding a termination for Good Reason, or if the Executive’s employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Executive’s death or Disability within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, then the Company shall (i) pay the Executive (or his or her estate, if applicable), in a lump sum in cash within 30 days after the Date of Termination, the Accrued Obligations and (ii) timely pay or provide to the Executive the Other Benefits. 

^^Termination for Cause. If the Company terminates the Executive’s employment with the Company for Cause within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, then the Company shall only pay the Executive such amounts, and provide such benefits, as is required by law. 

^^Vesting of Stock Options. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall cause all Executive options to purchase Company stock, which options were issued pursuant to the Company’s employee stock option plans and which options are outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control Date, to become fully vested and exercisable as of the Change in Control Date. 

^^Mitigation. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefits provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise. Further, the amount of any payment or benefits provided for in this Section 4 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as a result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Executive to the Company or otherwise. 

^^Outplacement Services. In the event the Executive is terminated by the Company (other than for Cause, Disability or Death), or the Executive terminates employment for Good Reason, within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, the Company shall provide outplacement services through one or more outside firms of the Executive’s choosing up to an aggregate of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] with such services to extend until the first to occur of (i) 12 months following the termination of Executive’s employment, or (ii) the date the Executive secures full time employment. 

^^Release. As a condition to Executive receiving the benefits under section 4.1(a)(i)(2) and (3), the Executive must first execute and deliver to Company a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliates in a form substantially similar to the general release attached hereto as Exhibit A, and such release, by its terms, has become irrevocable. 

^Certain Additional Payments By Company. 

^^General. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and except as set forth in this Section 5, in the event it shall be determined that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 5) (a “Payment”) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a “Gross-Up Payment”) in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes, including, without limitation, any income and payroll taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes) imposed upon the Payments. 

^^Procedures. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, all determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by [[Organization 1 Name]] or such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Accounting Firm”) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm and reasonably acceptable to the Company to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 5, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm’s determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive, subject to any determination otherwise by the Internal Revenue Service. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (“Underpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 5.3 and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. In addition, in certain instances an election may be made to recalculate the Excise Tax under applicable law. The Company may exercise such election and cause a recalculation to be made by the Accounting Firm, subject to the other provisions hereof. 

^^Notification of Claims. The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall: 

^^^give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, 

^^^take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by attorneys reasonably selected by the Company, 

^^^cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and 

^^^permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company’s control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. 

^^Refunds. If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5.3, the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company’s complying with the requirements of Section 5.3) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest actually paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5.3, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid. 

^^Sarbanes Oxley Act. No provision of this Section 5 is intended to be in violation of the loan prohibitions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to the extent any payment would be in violation thereof, such amounts shall be deemed a payment to the Executive with no obligation to refund or otherwise repay. 

^Disputes. 

^^Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration. All claims by the Executive for benefits under this Agreement shall be directed to and determined by the Board of Directors of the Company and shall be in writing. Any denial by the Board of Directors of a claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered to the Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon. The Board of Directors shall afford a reasonable opportunity to the Executive for a review of the decision denying a claim. Any further dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in [[Address 1: Address]], in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction. 

^^Expenses. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal, accounting and other fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any claim or contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others regarding the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive regarding the amount of any payment or benefits pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code. This Section 6.2 shall not apply to any claim made by the Executive which is not made in good faith or which is determined by the arbitrator or a court to be frivolous. 

^^Compensation During a Dispute. If the Change in Control Date occurs during the Term and the Executive’s employment with the Company terminates within 24 months following the Change in Control Date, and the right of the Executive to receive any benefits under this Agreement (or the amount or nature of the benefits to which he or she is entitled to receive) are the subject of a dispute between the Company and the Executive, the Company shall continue (a) to pay to the Executive his or her base salary in effect as of the Measurement Date and (b) to provide benefits to the Executive and the Executive’s family at least equal to those which would have been provided to them, if the Executive’s employment had not been terminated, in accordance with the applicable Benefit Plans in effect on the Measurement Date, until such dispute is resolved either by mutual written agreement of the parties or by an arbitrator’s award pursuant to Section 6.1, but in no event more than 12 months after the date of such dispute. Following the resolution of such dispute, the sum of the payments made to the Executive under clause (a) of this Section 6.3 shall be deducted from any cash payment which the Executive is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4; and if such sum exceeds the amount of the cash payment which the Executive is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4, the excess of such sum over the amount of such payment shall be repaid (without interest) by the Executive to the Company within 60 days of the resolution of such dispute. 

^Successors. 

^^Successor to Company. The Company shall require any Acquiring Corporation or any other successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to at least one-third or more of Company’s gross assets to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain an assumption of this Agreement at or prior to the effectiveness of any succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall constitute Good Reason if the Executive elects to terminate employment, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, “Company” shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise. 

^^Successor to Executive. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amount would still be payable to the Executive or his or her family hereunder if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Executive’s estate. 

^Notice. All notices, instructions and other communications given hereunder or in connection herewith shall be in writing. Any such notice, instruction or communication shall be sent either (i) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (ii) prepaid via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service, in each case addressed to the Company, at 320 Wakara Way, [[Address 2: Address]], Attn: General Counsel, and to the Executive at the address for notices indicated below (or to such other address as either the Company or the Executive may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith). Any such notice, instruction or communication shall be deemed to have been delivered five business days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or one business day after it is sent via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service. Either party may give any notice, instruction or other communication hereunder using any other means, but no such notice, instruction or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly delivered unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. 

^Miscellaneous. 

^^Employment by Subsidiary. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive’s employment with the Company shall not be deemed to have terminated solely as a result of the Executive continuing to be employed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

^^Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^Injunctive Relief. The Company and the Executive agree that any breach of this Agreement by the Company is likely to cause the Executive substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies which may be available, the Executive shall have the right to specific performance and injunctive relief. 

^^Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Utah, without regard to conflicts of law principles. 

^^Waivers. No waiver by the Executive at any time of any breach of, or compliance with, any provision of this Agreement to be performed by the Company shall be deemed a waiver of that or any other provision at any subsequent time. 

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but both of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^Tax Withholding. Any payments provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable tax withholding required under federal, state or local law. 

^^Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, employee or representative of any party hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein; and any prior agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein is hereby terminated and cancelled. 

^^Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Executive. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first set forth above.
