^**Indemnification**. Each Principal Stockholder, severally and not jointly, hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser Indemnified Party from, against and in respect of the full amount of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or any of them in respect of, arising from, in connection with, or incident to (a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by such Principal Stockholder in Section 3 of this Agreement; (b) any breach, violation, nonperformance or non-fulfillment of any covenants, agreements or obligations of such Principal Stockholder in this Agreement; (c) from and after the Closing, any fraud committed by the Company Known by such Principal Stockholder as of the date of this Agreement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Merger; and (d) any fraud committed by such Principal Stockholder with respect to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Merger; **provided, however**, that no indemnification payment to be made by a Principal Stockholder in respect of indemnification required to be made pursuant to this Agreement and any Company Stockholders’ Option Agreement to which such Principal Stockholder is a party, in the aggregate, shall be required to be made to the Purchaser Indemnification Parties in excess of the sum of, without duplication (i) the Merger Consideration actually paid to such Principal Stockholder and (ii) the Merger Consideration that would have been paid to such Principal Stockholder in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock that were donated or transferred by such Principal Stockholder since [[Date 3: Date]]. “Known” means the actual knowledge of such Principal Stockholder without a duty of investigation.

^**Release, Acknowledgement and Waiver**.

^**Authorization of Stockholders’ Representative**. Each Principal Stockholder hereby confirms his approval of the Stockholders’ Representative’s power and authority, and each of the other provisions set forth in Article XI of the Merger Agreement is hereby agreed, confirmed and ratified and shall be deemed incorporated by reference herein.

^^^in the event of an amendment to the Merger Agreement which is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, to confirm to the Purchaser that this Agreement, the Option Agreement and, to the extent any Stockholder consent is required therefor, that the consents of the Principal Stockholders in the Company Stockholders’ Consents remain in full force and effect; and

^^^to execute and deliver such immaterial modifications or waivers in connection with this Agreement or, to the extent any Stockholder consent is required, the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

^**Miscellaneous**.  

^^Continuing Obligations; Equitable Remedies. The restrictions set forth in Sections 1 and 2 are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purposes of protecting the value of the business and goodwill of the Surviving Corporation (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger) and each Principal Stockholder acknowledges that the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation would be irreparably harmed and that monetary damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the Purchaser in the event the covenants contained in Sections 1 and 2 were not complied with in accordance with their terms. The Principal Stockholders agree that any breach by such Principal Stockholder of any provision of Sections 1 or 2 shall entitle the Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to secure the enforcement of these provisions, in addition to any other remedies (including damages) which may be available to the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation. If any of the Principal Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates, heirs and personal and legal representatives breaches the covenants set forth in Section 1, the one-year period from the Closing Date described therein during which such restrictions apply shall be extended for a period equal to the period that a court having jurisdiction has determined that such covenant has been breached. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of Sections 1 and 2 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any provisions of Section 1 or 2 relating to the time period, scope of activities or geographic area of restrictions is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum permissible time period, scope of activities or geographic area, as the case may be, the time period, scope of activities or geographic area shall be reduced to the maximum which such court deems enforceable. If any provisions of Section 1 or 2 other than those described in the preceding sentence are adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended (with respect only to the jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made) in such manner as to render them enforceable and to effectuate as nearly as possible the original intentions and agreement of the parties.

^^Public Announcement. No public announcement or other publicity regarding this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be made prior to or after the date hereof without the prior written consent of Company and Purchaser as to form, content, timing and manner of distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any party or its Affiliates from making any public announcement or filing required pursuant to any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation.
