^Release by the Borrowers. 

Effective on the Tenth Amendment Effective Date, each Borrower, for itself and on behalf of its successors, assigns, and officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys, and any Person acting for or on behalf of, or claiming through it, hereby waives, releases, remises and forever discharges each Agent and each Lender, each of their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective successors in title, past, present and future officers, directors, employees, limited partners, general partners, investors, attorneys, assigns, subsidiaries, shareholders, trustees, agents and other professionals and all other persons and entities to whom any member of the Lenders would be liable if such persons or entities were found to be liable to the Borrowers (each a “Releasee” and collectively, the “Releasees”), from any and all past and present claims, suits, liens, lawsuits, adverse consequences, amounts paid in settlement, debts, deficiencies, diminution in value, disbursements, demands, obligations, liabilities, causes of action, damages, losses, costs and expenses of any kind or character, whether based in equity, law, contract, tort, implied or express warranty, strict liability, criminal or civil statute or common law (each a “Claim” and collectively, the “Claims”), whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, direct, indirect, or derivative, asserted or unasserted, matured or unmatured, foreseen or unforeseen, past or present, liquidated or unliquidated, suspected or unsuspected, which any Borrower ever had from the beginning of the world, now has, or might hereafter have against any such Releasee through the Tenth Amendment Effective Date, which Claims relate, directly or indirectly, to any act or omission by any Releasee that occurred on or prior to the date of this Tenth Amendment and relate, directly or indirectly, to the Financing Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any acts or omissions of any such Releasee with respect to the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the lender-borrower relationship evidenced by the Loan Documents, except for the duties and obligations set forth in the Financing Agreement and this Tenth Amendment. As to each and every claim released hereunder, each Borrower hereby represents that it has received the advice of legal counsel with regard to the releases contained herein, and having been so advised, specifically waives the benefit of the provisions of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California which provides as follows: 

“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH A CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” 

As to each and every claim released hereunder, each Borrower also waives the benefit of each other similar provision of applicable federal or state law (including without limitation the laws of the state of New York), if any, pertaining to general releases after having been advised by its legal counsel with respect thereto. 

Each Borrower acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts different from or in addition to those now known or believed to be true with respect to such claims, demands, or causes of action and agrees that this instrument shall be and remain effective in all respects notwithstanding any such differences or additional facts. Each Borrower understands, acknowledges and agrees that the release set forth above may be pleaded as a full and complete defense and may be used as a basis for an injunction against any action, suit or other proceeding which may be instituted, prosecuted or attempted in breach of the provisions of such release. 

Each Borrower, for itself and on behalf of its successors, assigns, and officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys, and any Person acting for or on behalf of, or claiming through it, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, covenants and agrees with and in favor of each Releasee above that it will not sue (at law, in equity, in any regulatory proceeding or otherwise) any Releasee on the basis of any claim released, remised and discharged by such Person pursuant to the above release. Each Borrower further agrees that it shall not dispute the validity or enforceability of the Financing Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any of its obligations thereunder, or the validity, priority, enforceability or the extent of the Agent’s Lien on any item of Collateral under the Financing Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If any Borrower or any of its respective successors, assigns, or officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys, or any Person acting for or on behalf of, or claiming through it violate the foregoing covenant, such Person, for itself and its successors, assigns and legal representatives, agrees to pay, in addition to such other damages as any Releasee may sustain as a result of such violation, all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by such Releasee as a result of such violation. 

^Miscellaneous. 

^^This Tenth Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

^^Section and paragraph headings herein are included for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Tenth Amendment for any other purpose. 

^^This Tenth Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 

^^Each Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that this Tenth Amendment constitutes a “Loan Document” under the Financing Agreement. Accordingly, it shall be an Event of Default under the Financing Agreement if (i) any representation or warranty made by a Borrower under or in connection with this Tenth Amendment shall have been untrue, false or misleading in any material respect when made, or (ii) a Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any term, covenant or agreement contained in this Tenth Amendment. 

^^The Borrowers will pay on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Tenth Amendment, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of [[Organization 3 Name]] LLP, counsel to the Agent and the Lenders.
