^NPPH provides a reasonable schedule for the cure of such breach that is acceptable to NSPI (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and

^NPPH commences and diligently proceeds to cure such breach in accordance with the agreed schedule for cure,

such breach shall not constitute an NPPH Event of Default unless the breach remains uncured when the time to cure such breach as set out in the agreed schedule for cure has lapsed; 

^^^NPPH suspends or abandons the Work;

^^^the cap on liquidated damages for delay is reached; or

^^the parent guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect.

^^In the event of a NPPH Event of Default, NSPI will have the following rights and remedies, in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available to NSPI under the EPC Contract and applicable laws, and NPPH will have the following obligations:

^^^NSPI, without prejudice to any of its other rights or remedies, may terminate the EPC Contract. If NSPI terminates the EPC Contract as a result of an NPPH Event of Default, it shall nevertheless, if requested by NPPH, provide steam, condensate, compressed air and related goods and services (the “Mill Services”) to NPPH for a price to be determined as follows:

^If NSPI does not complete the construction of the Utility Plant or if it completes the construction of the Utility Plant at a cost greater than an amount equal to the Contract Price, net of any damages paid by NPPH to NSPI under the EPC Contract, the price shall be agreed by the Parties, shall be based on the cost of fuel consumed and the proportionate costs of capital and operation and maintenance referable to the production of the Mill Services, and shall be invoiced monthly by NSPI to NPPH. Failing agreement on the price either Party may refer the matter to arbitration pursuant to paragraph 12(b);

^If NSPI completes the construction of the Utility Plant at a cost, net of any damages paid by NPPH to NSPI under the EPC Contract, which does not exceed an amount equal to the Contract Price, the price shall be that provided for in the MO & M Agreement or the Steam, Fuel and Shared Services Agreement pursuant to the MO & M Agreement whichever applies;

^If the situation contemplated in 2. occurs then there will be a true up with respect to any amount previously invoiced and paid under 1. above.

^^^NSPI may seek equitable relief to cause NPPH to take action or to refrain from taking action pursuant to the EPC Contract, or to make restitution of amounts improperly received under the EPC Contract;

^^^NSPI may, but is not obligated to, make such payments or perform such obligations as are required to cure an NPPH Event of Default and offset the cost of such payment or performance against payments otherwise due to NPPH under the EPC Contract; and may seek damages, including proceeding against any bond, guarantee, letter of credit, or other security given by or for the benefit of NPPH for its performance under the EPC Contract.

^^NPPH will be liable to NSPI for any and all actual damages to NSPI as a result of a NPPH Event of Default. To the extent that the actual costs of completing the Work, including compensation for obtaining a replacement contractor or for obtaining additional professional services required as a consequence of an NPPH Event of Default, exceed those costs that would have been payable to NPPH but for any NPPH Event of Default, NPPH will be obligated to pay the difference to NSPI. NSPI’s damages under this subparagraph (c) are limited by paragraph 19 below.

^^NSPI will be entitled to withhold further payments to NPPH for the Work performed prior to termination of the EPC Contract until NSPI determines the liability of NPPH, if any. Upon determination of the total cost of the Work, NSPI will notify NPPH in writing of the amount, if any, that NPPH will pay NSPI or NSPI will pay NPPH.

^^The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an event of default by NSPI hereunder (each, a **“NSPI Event of Default”**):

Each party will provide the other party with reasonable assistance in obtaining and maintaining all applicable permits. 

^**Dispute Resolution**

^^**Step Negotiation -** In the event of a dispute regarding the Project or the EPC Contract, the parties will attempt to resolve the dispute amicably and promptly by appointing a senior executive of each party to attempt to mutually agree upon a resolution. Either party may give the other party written notice of any dispute or claim. Within ten (10) days after delivery of said notice, the executives will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange information and attempt to resolve the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days. If the two senior executives cannot reach a resolution, the dispute may be set for arbitration as described herein.

^^**Arbitration -** In the event of a dispute arising between the parties as to the subject matter of the EPC Contract that cannot be resolved between them, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration, pursuant to the terms of the *Commercial Arbitration Act* (Nova Scotia). In particular, the parties agree to utilize the arbitration procedure set out in Schedule “A” to the *Commercial Arbitration Act* (Nova Scotia) in the conduct of the arbitration. The party wishing to have any dispute submitted to arbitration (the **“Claimant”**) will give notice to the other party (the **“Respondent”**) specifying the particulars of any issue in dispute and proposing the name of the individual it wishes to be the single arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) days thereafter, the Respondent will give notice to the Claimant advising whether the Respondent accepts the arbitrator proposed by the Claimant. If notice is not given within the fifteen (15) day period, the Respondent will be deemed to have accepted the arbitrator proposed by the Claimant. In the event that the parties can not agree on a single arbitrator within the fifteen (15) day period, the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the *Commercial Arbitration Act* (Nova Scotia). No such arbitrator will have previously been employed by either party and will not have a direct or indirect interest in either party or the subject matter of the arbitration. The cost of the arbitration (excluding a party’s legal fees and disbursements) will, unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator or the panel, be borne equally by the parties. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding and the beneficiary of any award of the arbitrator may bring proceedings in any jurisdiction to enforce the award or any judgment enforcing the award. The bringing of such proceedings in one or more jurisdictions will not preclude the bringing of enforcement proceedings in any other jurisdiction. In connection with any such proceeding, each party waives any right to de novo review of the award against that party. All matters relating to any arbitration held pursuant to this paragraph, including the existence of the dispute and its referral to arbitration, shall be held in confidence by both parties and disclosed only with the consent of both parties or if required by law.

^^**Continued Performance -** All Work and the performance of all other obligations, including undisputed payments, under the EPC Contract will continue during the dispute resolution proceeding.

^**Force Majeure**

^^**Effect of Force Majeure Event -** Each Party shall be excused from performance and shall not be construed to be in default in respect of any obligation hereunder, for so long as and to the extent that failure to perform such obligation is due to a Force Majeure Event; provided, however, a Force Majeure Event shall not excuse either Party from the obligation to make payments for any obligation.

^^**Notice of Force Majeure Event -** If either Party desires to invoke a Force Majeure Event as a cause for delay in its performance of, or failure to perform, any obligation hereunder, it shall, as soon as is practicable but in any event within ten (10) business days after the occurrence of the inability to perform due to a Force Majeure Event, advise the other Party in writing of such date and the nature and expected duration and effect of such Force Majeure Event. Promptly, but in any event within ten (10) days, after a notice is given pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Parties shall meet (or otherwise communicate) to discuss the basis and terms upon which the arrangements set out in the EPC Contract shall be continued, to the extent feasible taking into account the effects of such Force Majeure Event.

^^**Mitigation of Force Majeure Event -** Each Party suffering a Force Majeure Event shall take, or cause to be taken, such commercially reasonable action as may be necessary to void, or nullify, or otherwise to mitigate, in all material respects, the effects of such Force Majeure Event. The Parties shall take all reasonable steps to ensure normal performance under this Agreement, including the resumption of any disrupted obligations.

^^**Definition of “Force Majeure Event”** **-** for the purposes of this paragraph 13, “Force Majeure Event” means any event which wholly or partly prevents or delays the performance of any obligation arising under this Agreement, but only if and to the extent (i) such event is not within the reasonable control of the Party affected, (ii) such event, despite the affected Party’s exercise of reasonable diligence, cannot be or be caused to be prevented, avoided or removed by the affected Party, and (iii) the party affected has taken all commercially reasonable precautions and measures in order to avoid the effect of such event on such Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to mitigate the consequences thereof including any contingency plans agreed between the Parties or which a Party has represented it has in place, and (iv) such event is not the direct result of the affected Party’s negligence or the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, a “Force Majeure Event” may include any of the following:

^^^acts of God or the public enemy, war, whether declared or not, blockade, insurrection, riot, civil disturbance, public disorder, rebellion, violent demonstration, revolution, or sabotage;

^^^any effect of unusual natural elements, including fire, volcanic eruption, landslide, earthquake, flood, tsunami, lightning, hurricane, unusually severe storm, perils of sea, or similar cataclysmic occurrence or other unusual natural calamity;

^^^explosion, accident or epidemic;

^^^accidents of navigation or breakdown or injury of vessels, accidents to harbours, docks, bridges, canals or other assistances to or adjuncts of shipping or navigation, epidemic or quarantine;

^^^strikes, lockouts or other labour disturbances;

^^^nuclear emergency, radioactive contamination or ionizing radiation or the release of any hazardous material;

^^^air crash, shipwreck, train wreck, or any other failures or delays of transportation if the cause of such other failure or delay otherwise would qualify under the EPC Contract as a Force Majeure Event;

but does not include any event to the extent that: 

^^^it is caused by the unavailability of labour (other than unavailability of labour due to such strikes, lockouts or other labour disturbances as are Force Majeure Events) or raw materials, the breakdown of the Utility Plant or other plant breakdown or equipment failure unless and to the extent that such event is itself caused by a Force Majeure Event or which if it occurred in relation to either Party would have been a Force Majeure Event or is caused by a latent defect in the Utility Plant or other plant or equipment;

^^^the event is constituted by any failure of a subcontractor unless and to the extent that the subcontractor was itself affected by an event, which if it occurred in relation to either Party would have been a Force Majeure Event;

^^^it relates to the condition of the Project site including subsurface conditions and contamination at or affecting the Project site;

^^^risks associated with that event have been accepted by the relevant Party by the terms of the EPC Contract; or

^^^it relates to any change in applicable law.

^**Change Orders**

^^A change order may result only from any of the following:

^^^Changes in the Work required by NSPI in writing, including an acceleration of Work, in accordance with the EPC Contract;

^^^Changes in the Work required by an event of Force Majeure; or

^^^The occurrence of an NSPI caused delay as defined by the EPC Contract;

^^NSPI will have the right to make changes in the Work and all such changes will be deemed to be part of the Work. If NPPH will be actually, demonstrably delayed in the performance of a critical path item identified in the schedule due solely to an NSPI caused delay or a Force Majeure Event, then NPPH may request a change order under which the Project schedule (and each milestone date referenced therein) will be extended by the period of time that NPPH is actually and demonstrably delayed in the performance of such critical path item.

^^In the event the change in Work is caused by a Force Majeure Event, the Contract Price will also be changed to reflect NPPH’s non-labour Project cost resulting from such change less any insurance proceeds in respect of that change.

^^In the event the change in Work is caused by an NSPI caused delay, the Contract Price will also be changed to reflect NPPH’s Project cost resulting from such change order work less any savings or costs not incurred as a result.

^^If NSPI agrees to a change order for changes in the Work required by NSPI in writing, including an acceleration of Work, in accordance with the EPC Contract, the Contract Price will be increased by the agreed amount. In the event the parties cannot agree, the Contract Price will be equitably adjusted in accordance with the principles set out in the EPC Contract.

^^If a change in Work involves a reduction in the cost to perform the Work, there will be a lump sum deduction from the Contract Price, which deduction will be based on the amount that NPPH has in its budget for the Work involved, inclusive of direct and indirect costs, overhead, margins, contingencies, fees and profit that have not already been incurred. If necessary and specified on the change order accepted by NSPI, NSPI will adjust the Contract Price and the Project schedule, the progress payment schedule and otherwise as required as a result of the agreed change order.

^^If any change in applicable law demonstrably increases NPPH’s Project cost by $[[USD Value 5: Number]] or less, such cost will be borne by NPPH without an increase in the Contract Price. If the change in applicable law demonstrably increases NPPH’s Project costs by more than $[[USD Value 6: Number]] the Contract Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference between NPPH’s demonstrable increased Project costs resulting from a change in the applicable law and $[[USD Value 7: Number]]

^**Notices**

Any Notice pursuant to the EPC Contract will be in writing and (i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, (iii) sent by a recognized overnight mail or courier service, with delivery receipt requested, or (iv) sent by confirmed facsimile transmission with telephonic confirmation, to the addresses designated in the contract. Notices will be effective when received by the other party. Any technical or other communications pertaining to the Work will be with the parties’ designated representative. Each party will notify the other in writing of the name of such representatives. 

^**Choice of Law**

The EPC Contract will be governed exclusively by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. 

^**NPPH Indemnity**

^^For the purposes of this paragraph 17, **“NSPI Indemnified Parties”** means NSPI and its respective employees, agents, partners, directors, officers, and assigns.

^^NPPH shall indemnify and hold the NSPI Indemnified Parties harmless from any liability resulting from the failure of NPPH or its subcontractors to make timely payments of the items referred to in this paragraph or such similar items for which NPPH is responsible. Any interest, penalties or other liabilities arising from such failure shall be the sole responsibility of and be paid for by NPPH.

^^NPPH shall indemnify and save harmless the NSPI Indemnified Parties from all workers’ compensation assessments due by NPPH in relation to the Work.

^^NPPH shall at all times reimburse, protect, indemnify and save free and harmless the NSPI Indemnified Parties, the Project site and the other lands and property of the NSPI Indemnified Parties from and against all liens and claims made or liability incurred by the NSPI Indemnified Parties on account of the Work performed or materials supplied by employees of NPPH and subcontractors, or on account of an exaggerated lien filed by NPPH, including, without limitation, legal fees on a solicitor-and-own-client (indemnity) basis, except to the extent that NSPI has failed to pay NPPH in accordance with the EPC Contract. NPPH shall cause any such lien or claim which may be filed or made, to be released and discharged forthwith at the expense of NPPH. If NPPH fails to release or obtain the release and discharge of any such lien or claim, then NSPI may, but shall not be obliged to, discharge, release or otherwise deal with the lien or claim, and

NPPH shall pay any and all costs and expenses incurred by the NSPI Indemnified Parties in so releasing, discharging or otherwise dealing with the claim or lien, including but not limited to, legal fees on a solicitor-and-own-client (indemnity) basis. Any amounts so paid by the NSPI Indemnified Parties may be deducted from any amounts due NPPH whether under the EPC Contract or otherwise.

^^NPPH shall be liable to and shall indemnify, and hold harmless the NSPI Indemnified Parties for all losses, damages and expenses, including legal fees on a solicitor-and-own-client (indemnity) basis, which they or any of them may incur as a result of any third party claims, demands, actions or proceedings for:

^^^any acts or omissions in connection with the performance, purported performance or non-performance of the EPC Contract or of the Work by NPPH or its subcontractors or their respective employees or agents;

^^^any acts or omissions of NSPI, other contractors or their respective employees or agents, or in connection with such acts or omissions, while acting under the direction and control of NPPH, its subcontractors or their respective employees or agents; or

^^^any liability, claims, damages, costs and expenses arising from the failure of NPPH or its subcontractors, or their respective employees or agents to comply with the law.

^^NPPH shall, at its sole expense, if requested by NSPI, defend those persons entitled to be indemnified by NPPH under the EPC Contract. NSPI shall have the right, if it so elects, to participate in any such defence and NPPH shall have the right to settle claims to a maximum of $[[USD Value 8: Number]] without first consulting with NSPI and thereafter only with the consent of NSPI, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and paragraph 24 shall not apply to such consent.

^^NPPH shall be liable to and shall indemnify the NSPI Indemnified Parties for all losses, damages and expenses on account of:

^^^all physical damage caused by NPPH or its subcontractors to the Work, the Project site, the property of the NSPI Indemnified Parties or other contractors or property under the care, custody or control of NSPI or other contractors; and

^^^the cost to repair or make good any and all damage to roads, bridges, railroads, highways, land adjacent to the Project site, irrigation canals or facilities, ditches or equipment relating thereto caused by or resulting from the actions howsoever of NPPH or its subcontractors in relation to this Project.

^**NSPI Indemnity**

^^NSPI shall indemnify and save NPPH harmless from all claims and demands, including legal fees on a solicitor-and-own-client (indemnity) basis arising out of any patent, trademark, copyright or industrial design infringement pertaining to any equipment, machinery, materials, compositions, processes, methods or designs supplied or specified for use by NSPI to NPPH for use in connection with the Work.

^^NSPI shall indemnify and hold harmless NPPH, its subcontractors, and their respective officers and directors from and against all third party claims, demands, losses, damages, expenses, actions and proceedings and which arise on account of and are attributable to NSPI’s obligations hereunder and the action of NSPI employees, agents and contractors (excluding NPPH) while on the Project site to the extent such employees, agents and contractors (excluding NPPH) are not working under the direction or control of NPPH, its subcontractors or their respective employees or agents.

^**Limitation of Liability**

^^Except for liquidated damages, claims arising under the indemnities for intellectual property, liens, third party claims and workers’ compensation and except to the extent to which coverage is provided by a policy or policies of insurance, as applicable:

^^^NPPH’s total aggregate liability on any basis whatsoever (including all financial and non-financial obligations) to NSPI shall be limited to $[[USD Value 12: Number]] Million, provided that in the event that NPPH has abandoned the Work then NPPH’s total aggregate liability, including all liquidated damages, shall be limited to [[Percentage 8: Number]]% of the Contract Price plus $[[USD Value 12]] million; and

^^^NPPH, its subcontractors, and their respective officers and directors shall not be liable to NSPI, or anyone claiming through or under it, whether by way of indemnity or by reason of breach of contract or in tort, including liability for negligence and breach of statutory duty, or on any other legal or equitable basis, for:

^special, punitive, indirect, economic or consequential loss or damage;

^loss of use, whether complete or partial, of the Work or existing facilities of NSPI or third parties;

^loss of product;

^loss of revenue, overhead and profit; or

^loss of any contract that may be suffered by NSPI.

^^NSPI’s total aggregate liability on any basis whatsoever (including all financial and non-financial obligations) to NPPH shall be limited to $[[USD Value 12]] Million except for the obligation to pay the Contract Price in accordance with the terms of the EPC Contract.

^**Title and Risk of Loss**

Title to all Work (including work in process) shall pass to NSPI at the earliest possible moment in time and NPPH will use reasonable commercial efforts to include in its subcontracts a provision expressly for the benefit of NSPI providing that title to any personal property forming, or to form, part of the Work, shall pass directly to NSPI, and not to NPPH. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, NPPH shall ensure that NSPI has the right to pay for the steam turbine generator, main transformer and steam condenser and take title directly from the supplier of such items and, if NSPI exercises that right, NSPI shall provide any necessary deposit, down payment, or prepayment required by the equipment vendor. Any such step would be taken for the sole purpose of securing NSPI’s title to key equipment and would in no way derogate from or reduce NPPH’s responsibilities or obligations under the EPC Contract, including with respect to delivery, installation and performance guarantees. The portion of the Contract Price paid to suppliers directly by NSPI will be deemed to have been paid to NPPH for the purposes of the EPC Contract. Until Commercial Operation has been attained NPPH will bear the risk of loss and full responsibility for the costs of replacement, repair or reconstruction resulting from any damage to or destruction of the Utility Plant (or any portion thereof) or any materials, equipment, tools and supplies, which are purchased for permanent installation in or for use during construction of the Utility Plant regardless of whether NSPI has title thereto under the EPC Contract, provided that in the event such loss or damage is a result of the negligence or intentional misconduct of NSPI, its employees, agents and contractors (excluding NPPH), in which event NSPI will be responsible with respect to any losses covered by the Builder’s Risk insurance for up to the permitted deductible applicable thereto. 

^**Site Conditions**

NPPH will be deemed to have conducted a full and complete investigation of the existing Site, including subsurface site conditions, and acknowledges and accepts the existing Site conditions as is. NPPH will agree that neither the Required Commercial Operation Date nor any other Project dates will be extended, the Contract Price will not be modified, and NPPH will not be entitled to request or be granted any change order as a result of any Site conditions, including any presence of hazardous materials, variance of the subsurface Site conditions from the those assumed by NPPH or geotechnical conditions in agreeing to the Contract Price and executing the contract. 

^**Project Security**

^^To secure NPPH’s performance of its obligations under the EPC Contract, NPPH agrees to obtain:

^^^as a closing condition of the APA, an irrevocable draw-down letter of credit (or other form of security acceptable to NSPI, in its sole discretion) substantially in the form attached as Schedule E in the amount of $[[USD Value 12]] Million; and

^^^on the earlier of:

^the date on which the aggregate Contract Price invoiced under the EPC Contract meets or exceeds $[[USD Value 12]] million; and

^[[Date 3: Date]],

^^letter of credit in replacement of the letter of credit in (i) on the same terms as the letter of credit in (i) in the amount of $[[USD Value 13: Number]] million. 

^^On the Commercial Operation Date, NPPH may reduce the letter of credit to $[[USD Value 12]] Million on the same terms as the original letter of credit. Unless the letter of credit is called, it will expire on the date that is the later of: (a) two weeks following the Total Completion Date; and (b) two weeks following the end of the warranty period set out in section 7(a).

^^The EPC Contract will set out the process for renewing and replacing letters of credit before their expiry.

^^Dollar amounts set out above are in Canadian dollars but the letters of credit and replacements thereof may be denominated in Canadian or US dollars. The EPC Contract will include judgement currency language.

^**Documentation**

^^NSPI shall have the right of inspection and review of all Documentation at all reasonable times. No inspection, or failure to inspect, by NSPI shall relieve NPPH of NPPH’s obligations under the EPC Contract.

^^Prior to commencement of the performance tests, NPPH shall prepare, and submit to NSPI, operation and maintenance manuals and process and instrumentation drawings in accordance with the Owner’s Requirements. The Work shall not be considered to be completed for the purposes of the EPC Contract until such operation and maintenance manuals and process and instrumentation drawings have been submitted to NSPI.

^^NPPH shall:

^^^prepare the Documentation*;*

^^^keep the Documentation up to date, including by way of recording the exact locations of each of any differences, sizes and details of the Work from the as-built drawings, with cross-references to relevant specifications and other requirements on the as-built drawings;

^^^keep the Documentation on the Site;

^^^upon completion of the Work, or at such other later time as may be determined by the Owner, submit the Documentation to NSPI in accordance with the Owner’s Requirements.

^^^the professional member or licensee who prepared them or under whose supervision and control they were prepared; or

^^^the professional member or licensee who thoroughly reviewed and accepted professional responsibility for them.

^**Deemed Approval**

Unless otherwise agreed in the EPC Contract, with respect to any approval or consent right of NSPI hereunder that is qualified by the words “not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed”, such approval or consent will be deemed to have been given if NSPI does not respond to the request for approval or consent within 10 business days of its receipt of the request.

^^All the insurance,

^^^will not be subject to invalidation (as regards the interest of NSPI), by reason of any breach or violation of any warranties, representations, declarations or conditions;
