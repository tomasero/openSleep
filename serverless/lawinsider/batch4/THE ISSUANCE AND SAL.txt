Holder hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law, which might be asserted as a bar to such remedy of specific performance. 

^^^All rights and interests of the holders of Senior Debt hereunder, and all agreements and obligations of the Holder, or Maker hereunder, shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of: 

^^^^^ 
^^^any lack of validity or enforceability of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, this Note (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) or any other Loan Document (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement); 

^^^any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Senior Debt, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Senior Secured Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement), including, without limitation, any increase in the Senior Debt resulting from the extension of additional credit to Maker or otherwise: 

^^^any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any part of the Senior Debt; 

^^^any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Senior Debt, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Senior Debt or any other assets of any Borrower; 

^^^the grant of any adjustment, indulgence or forbearance, or compromise with, Maker with respect to the Senior Debt; 

^^^any change, restructuring or termination of the structure or existence of the Maker; or 

^^^any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Maker or any Holder. 

^^Each of Maker and Holder hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Senior Debt and this clause 9 and any requirement that Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien on the any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to taken any action against Maker or any other person or entity or any collateral. 

^^This Note and all other instruments (and all replacements thereof) evidencing the Subordinated Debt or any part thereof shall be inscribed with a legend conspicuously indicating that the payment thereof is subordinated to the payment of Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9. 

^^This Section 9 shall constitute a continuing offer to all Persons who become holders of, or continue to hold, Senior Debt; and such holders are made obligees hereunder and any one or more of them, or their designated representative, may enforce such provisions, and all such holders shall be deemed to have relied thereon. The subordination effected by this Section 9 is a continuing subordination, and the Holder unconditionally waives notice of the incurring of any Senior Debt or any part thereof and reliance by any holders of Senior Debt upon the subordination contained herein. The Holder acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement to and a consideration of the holders of Senior Debt, whether such Senior Debt was created or acquired before or after the 

^^^^^ 
incurrence or creation of any Subordinated Debt and whether such holders of Senior Debt are now known or hereafter become known, and each holder of Senior Debt shall be deemed conclusively to have relied upon such subordination provisions in acquiring and holding, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Debt and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Section 9 directly as if it were a party to this Note. No right of any present or future holders of Senior Debt to enforce subordination provisions contained in this Section 9 shall at any time be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of Maker or by any noncompliance by Maker with the terms of this Note.

The Holder shall not by any act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have amended, modified, supplemented, waived, extended, discharged or terminated any of its rights or remedies, except by an amendment, modification, supplement, waiver, extension, discharge or termination in writing and signed by the appropriate parties, as 

^^^^^ 
may be applicable. All rights and remedies of the Holder under the terms of this Note and applicable statutes or rules of law shall be cumulative, and may be exercised successively or concurrently. The Maker agrees that there are no defenses, equities or setoffs with respect to the obligations set forth herein. 

^Compliance With Applicable Law. It is the intent of Holder and Maker in the execution and performance of this Note to remain in strict compliance with Applicable Law from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof, the Holder and the Maker stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in this Note shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money with interest at a rate or in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate or maximum amount of interest permitted or allowed to be contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved under Applicable Law. For purposes of this Note, “interest” shall include the aggregate of all amounts which constitute or are deemed to constitute interest under Applicable Law which are contracted for, taken, charged, reserved, received or paid under this Note. The Maker shall never be required to pay unearned interest and shall never be required to pay interest at a rate or in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate or maximum amount of interest that may be lawfully contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved under Applicable Law, and the provisions of this paragraph shall control over all other provisions of this Note, which may be in actual or apparent conflict herewith. If the maturity of this Note is accelerated for any reason, or if under any other contingency the interest effective rate or amount of interest which would otherwise be payable under this Note would exceed the Maximum Rate or maximum amount of interest Holder is permitted or allowed by Applicable Law to charge, contract for, take, reserve or receive, or in the event Holder shall charge, contract for, take, reserve or receive monies that are deemed to constitute interest which would, in the absence of this provision, increase the effective interest rate or amount of interest payable under this Note to a rate or amount in excess of that permitted or allowed to be charged, contracted for, taken, reserved or received under Applicable Law then in effect, then the principal amount of this Note or the amount of interest which would otherwise be payable under this Note, or both, shall be reduced to the amount allowed under Applicable Law as now or hereinafter construed by the courts having jurisdiction, and all such monies so charged, contracted for, taken, reserved or received that are deemed to constitute interest in excess of the Maximum Rate or maximum amount of interest permitted by Applicable Law shall immediately be returned to or credited to the account of the Maker upon such determination. The Holder and the Maker further stipulate and agree that, without limitation of the foregoing, all calculations of the rate or amount of interest contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received under this Note which are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate or amount exceeds the Maximum Rate, shall be made to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, by amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading during the period of the full stated term of this Note, all interest hereon at any time contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received from the Maker or otherwise by the Holder. 

^General. This Note was negotiated in New York, and made by the Maker and accepted by the Holder in the State of New York, and the proceeds of this Note were disbursed from New York, which State the parties agree has a substantial relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction embodied hereby, and in all respects (including, without limitation, matters of construction, validity and performance), this Note and the obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New 

^^^^^ 
York applicable to contracts made and performed in such State and any applicable law of the United States of America.

\centered **GUARANTEE** 

^Each of Guarantors hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest, on the attached Subordinated Promissory Note of [[Organization 1 Name]] (the “Maker”), dated [[Date 1]] (the “Note”) when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise and (b) the full and punctual payment and performance within applicable grace periods of all other Obligations of the Maker under the Note whether for fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise under the Note (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Guarantee shall have the meanings given them in the Note. 

^Each Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from each such Guarantor and that such Guarantor will remain bound under this Guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation. 

^Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Maker of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Maker or any other Person under the Note or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of the Note or any other agreement; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Note or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder for the Guaranteed Obligations or any Guarantor; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (f) any change in the ownership of such Guarantor. 

^Each Guarantor hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to have its obligations hereunder divided among the Guarantors, such that such Guarantor’s obligations would be less than the full amount claimed. Each Guarantor hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to have the assets of the Maker first be used and depleted as payment of the Maker’s or such Guarantor’s obligations hereunder prior to any amounts being claimed from or paid by such Guarantor hereunder. Each Guarantor hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to require that the Maker be sued prior to an action being initiated against such Guarantor. 

^Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

^Each Guarantee is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in Section 9 of the Note, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of 

^^^^^ 
and premium, if any, and interest and other Senior Debt of the Guarantor giving such Guarantee; and each Guarantee is made subject to such provisions of the Note. 

^Except as expressly set forth in Section 11 of this Guarantee, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Note or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity. 

^Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Maker or otherwise. 

^In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Maker to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Holder, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holder an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid principal amount of such Guaranteed Obligations and (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by applicable law). 

^Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holder in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations and all obligations to which the Guaranteed Obligations are subordinated as provided in Section 9 of the Note. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holder, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be accelerated as provided in the Note for the purposes of such Guarantor’s Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Section 8 of the Note, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee. Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Guarantee. 

^^^^^ 
^Any term or provision of the Note to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering the Note and the Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, void or voidable under applicable law relating to solvency, fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, prohibited distributions to shareholders or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. 

^Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee shall be entitled upon payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.
