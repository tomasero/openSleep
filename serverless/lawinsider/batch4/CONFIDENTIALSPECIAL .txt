Dear John: 

As we discussed, I am pleased to confirm your position as Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Services of [[Organization 1 Name]] (“NNC”) and [[Organization 1 Name]] Limited (“NNL”) (the “Position”), and your compensation arrangements in connection with your Position. This letter (the “Agreement”) amends, restates and supersedes your employment agreement with [[Organization 1 Name]] Limited dated [[Date 2: Date]] and supplemental agreement dated [[Date 3: Date]] (together, and as amended from time to time, the “Original Agreement”), and the Original Agreement shall cease to be effective as of the date hereof.[[Organization 1 Name]] (“NNC”) and/or [[Organization 1 Name]] Limited (“NNL”) and/or, where applicable, any subsidiary thereof including NNI, are collectively referred to herein as “Nortel”. 

Implementation of certain elements of this Agreement, including one or more of the following: (i) acceleration of any payment under the [[Organization 1 Name]] Key Executive Incentive Plan and (ii) the Special Incentive Plan (addressed below), is subject to approval by the NNC and NNL Boards of Directors, [[Organization 2 Name]] as the Monitor appointed under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the “Canadian Monitor”) in consultation with the NNI Principal Officer, the Unsecured Creditors Committee, and the Ad Hoc Bondholder group (the Principal Officer, the Unsecured Creditors Committee and the Ad Hoc Bondholder group together form the “Group”), and any necessary court approvals. 

All dollar amounts contained herein are expressed in Canadian dollars. 

**Base Salary** 

Your base salary will continue to be $[[USD Value 1: Number]] calculated on a per annum basis and paid to you bi-weekly. 

**Annual Incentive Plan** 

You will continue to be eligible to participate in the [[Organization 1 Name]] Limited Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) pursuant to its terms and conditions. Your annual target award under the AIP is [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of base salary. 

**Special Incentive Plan** 

Conditioned upon your acceptance of this agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, you will be eligible, provided you are an active employee as of [[Date 4: Date]], to receive a payment of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] as a participant in the Nortel Special Incentive Plan in accordance with its terms and conditions, a copy of which is enclosed and will be presented to the Canadian Courts in the *Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act* (Canada) (“CCAA”) proceedings and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for approval on [[Date 5: Date]]. The enclosed documents (the “Plan Document”) and this Agreement are subject to receipt of such court approvals and any future amendments that may be made to them by such courts or the Board and, as so approved and amended, are collectively referred to as the “Plan”. 

Notwithstanding provisions in the Plan, to the contrary, in the event NNC/NNL initiates your employment termination and it is not for Cause, or upon the termination of your employment due to death or disability, you will receive immediate full acceleration and payment of (x) $[[USD Value 3: Number]] in the event of termination during 2010 due to disability, or (y) $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in the event of (A) termination by NNC/NNL prior to [[Date 6: Date]] not for Cause or due to death, or (B) termination on or after [[Date 7: Date]] but prior to [[Date 6]] due to disability. The applicable amount will be paid to you (or, as applicable, your estate) as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than 60 days following such termination of employment. In the event of your voluntary resignation or termination by NNC/NNL for Cause, all unpaid amounts are forfeited. For purposes of this Agreement, termination of employment by you upon a material breach of this agreement by Nortel will constitute an involuntary termination by NNC/NNL not for Cause, in the event that (a) such termination occurs no later than the earlier of [[Date 4]] and 135 days following the occurrence of such breach; (b) within 90 days of such breach, you provide Nortel with written notice of the occurrence of such breach; (c) Nortel had 30 days’ opportunity to cure such breach following receipt of written notice from you; and (d) such breach is not so cured.
