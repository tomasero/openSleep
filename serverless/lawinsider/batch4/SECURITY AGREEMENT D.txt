SECURITY AGREEMENT dated as of [[Date 1]] made by [[Organization 2 Name]], a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), and the Persons listed on the signature pages hereof (the Borrower and the Persons so listed being, collectively, the “Grantors”), to [[Organization 1 Name]], N.A., as agent (together with any successor agents appointed pursuant to the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the “Agent”) for the Secured Parties (as hereinafter defined). 

\centered **PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS** 

^The Grantors have entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of [[Date 2: Date]] and amended as of [[Date 3: Date]], [[Date 4: Date]] and [[Date 1]] (as the same may be amended, amended and restated, extended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with the Agent, [[Organization 3 Name]], as syndication agent, and the Banks parties thereto from time to time. 

^The Grantors have entered into a Collateral Assignment of Proceeds and Security Agreement, dated as of [[Date 2]] (as the same may be amended, amended and restated, extended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Collateral Assignment”) with the Agent, pursuant to which the Grantors have granted to the Agent, for itself, the Banks, the Cash Management Banks and any Bank or Affiliate of a Bank that has entered into an interest rate protection agreement with any Grantor (collectively, the “Secured Parties”), a collateral assignment and security interest in the “Collateral” (as defined in the Collateral Assignment). 

^Certain of the Grantors have entered into a Pledge Agreement, dated as of [[Date 2]] (as the same may be amended, amended and restated, extended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Pledge Agreement”) with the Agent, pursuant to which such Grantors have granted to the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a pledge and security interest in the “Pledged Collateral” (as defined in the Pledge Agreement). 

^Each Grantor is, as of the date hereof, the owner of the indebtedness (the “Initial Pledged Debt”) set forth opposite such Grantor’s name on and as otherwise described in Schedule I hereto and issued by the obligors named therein. 

^Each Grantor is, as of the date hereof, the owner of the deposit accounts (the “Pledged Deposit Accounts”) set forth opposite such Grantor’s name on Part I of Schedule II hereto. 

^Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, promptly following the Agent’s request, the Borrower shall establish an account (the “Collateral Account”) in the name of and the sole dominion of Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties. 

^Each Grantor is, as of the date hereof, the owner of the securities accounts (the “Securities Accounts”) set forth opposite such Grantor’s name on Part II of Schedule II hereof. 

^It is a condition precedent to Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement and Amendment No. 2 to the Collateral Assignment of even date herewith (“Amendment No. 3”) that the Grantors shall have granted the security interest contemplated by this Agreement. Each Grantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents. 

^Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Agreement are used in this Agreement as defined in the Credit Agreement. Further, unless otherwise defined in this Agreement or in the Credit Agreement, terms defined in Article 8 or 9 of the UCC (as defined below) are used in this Agreement as such terms are defined in such Article 8 or 9. “UCC” means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; provided, that, if perfection or the effect of perfection or non-perfection or the priority of the security interest in any Collateral is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in a jurisdiction other than the State of New York, “UCC” means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in such other jurisdiction for purposes of the provisions hereof relating to such perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection or priority.

provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the security interest granted under this Section 1 attach to any lease, license, contract or agreement to which any Grantor is a party or any of its rights or interests thereunder if and for so long as the grant of such security interest shall constitute or result in a breach or termination of, or a default under, any such lease, license, contract or agreement pursuant to the terms thereof (other than to the extent that such terms would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-405, 9-406, 9-407 or 9-408 of the UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code) or principles of equity); provided further, however, that (A) such security interest, to the extent severable, shall attach immediately to any portion of such lease, license, contract or agreement that does not result in any of the consequences specified above; and (B) the foregoing exclusion shall not in any way limit, impair or otherwise affect the Secured Parties’ continuing security interest upon any rights or interests of the Grantors in or to (I) monies due or to become due in respect of such lease, license, contract or agreement or (II) any and all proceeds from the sale, transfer, assignment, license, lease or other disposition of such lease, license, contract or agreement. 

^Security for Obligations. This Agreement secures, in the case of each Grantor, the payment of all Obligations of such Grantor now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, under Secured Cash Management Agreements, and under Secured Interest Rate Protection Agreements, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, reimbursement obligations, interest, fees, premiums, penalties, indemnifications, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (all such Obligations being the “ Secured Obligations”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures, as to each Grantor, the payment of all amounts that constitute part of the Secured Obligations and would be owed by such Grantor to any Secured Party under the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving a Loan Party. 

^Grantors Remain Liable. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) each Grantor shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements included in such Grantor’s Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by the Agent of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral and (c) no Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor shall any Secured Party be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantor thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. 

^Delivery and Control of Security Collateral. 

^^All certificates or instruments representing or evidencing Security Collateral (other than, except upon the request of the Agent after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Pledged Debt in a principal amount not in excess of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] individually and $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in the aggregate) shall be delivered to and held by or on behalf of the Agent pursuant hereto and shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. The Agent shall have the right at any time to exchange certificates or instruments representing or evidencing Security Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger denominations. 

^^With respect to any Security Collateral that constitutes an uncertificated security, the relevant Grantor will, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the request of the Agent, cause the issuer thereof either (i) to register the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as the registered owner of such security or (ii) to agree with such Grantor and the Agent that such issuer will comply with instructions with respect to such security originated by the Agent without further consent of such Grantor, such agreement to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (such agreement being an “Uncertificated Security Control Agreement”). 

^^With respect to any Securities Account, the Collateral Account and Security Collateral that constitutes a security entitlement as to which the financial institution acting as Agent hereunder is not the securities intermediary, the relevant Grantor will, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the request of the Agent, cause the securities intermediary with respect to such Account or security entitlement either (i) to identify in its records the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as the entitlement holder thereof or (ii) to agree with such Grantor and the Agent that such securities intermediary will comply with entitlement orders originated by the Agent without further consent of such Grantor, such agreement to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (a “Securities Account Control Agreement”). 

^^The Agent shall have the right, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in its discretion and without notice to any Grantor, to transfer to or to register in the name of the Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Security Collateral, subject only to the revocable rights specified in Section 14(a). In addition, the Agent shall have the right following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default to convert Security Collateral consisting of financial assets credited to the Securities Accounts or the Collateral Account to Security Collateral consisting of financial assets held directly by the Agent, and to convert Security Collateral consisting of financial assets held directly by the Agent to Security Collateral consisting of financial assets credited to the Securities Accounts or the Collateral Account. 

^^Upon the request of the Agent following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor will notify each issuer of Security Collateral granted by it hereunder that such Security Collateral is subject to the security interest granted hereunder. 

^Maintaining the Account Collateral. So long as the Loans or any other Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document, under any Secured Cash Management Agreement, or under any Secured Interest Rate Protection Agreement, shall remain unpaid, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the request of the Agent: 

^^Each Grantor will maintain deposit accounts only with the financial institution acting as Agent hereunder or with a bank (a “Pledged Account Bank”) that has agreed with such Grantor and the Agent to comply with instructions originated by the Agent directing the disposition of funds in such deposit account without the further consent of such Grantor, such agreement to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (a “Deposit Account Control Agreement”). 

^^Each Grantor will (i) immediately instruct each Person obligated at any time to make any payment to such Grantor for any reason (an “Obligor”) to make such payment to a Pledged Deposit Account or the Collateral Account and (ii) deposit in a Pledged Deposit Account or the Collateral Account, at the end of each Business Day, all proceeds of Collateral and all other cash of such Grantor. 

^^Each Grantor will instruct each Pledged Account Bank to transfer to the Collateral Account, at the end of each Business Day, in same day funds, an amount equal to the credit balance of the Pledged Deposit Account at such Pledged Account Bank. If any Grantor shall fail to give any such instructions to any Pledged Account Bank, the Agent may do so without further notice to any Grantor. 

^^The Agent may, at any time and without notice to, or consent from, the Grantor, transfer, or direct the transfer of, funds from the Pledged Deposit Accounts or the Collateral Account to satisfy the Grantor’s obligations under the Loan Documents if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 

^^Each Grantor agrees that it will not add any bank that maintains a deposit account for such Grantor or open any new deposit account with any then-existing Pledged Account Bank unless (i) the Agent shall have received at least 10 Business Days’ prior written notice of such additional bank or such new deposit account and (ii) the Agent shall have received a Deposit Account Control Agreement authenticated by such new bank and such Grantor or a supplement to an existing Deposit Account Control Agreement with such then-existing Pledged Account Bank, covering such new deposit account (and, upon receipt by the Agent of such Deposit Account Control Agreement or supplement, Schedule II shall automatically be amended to include such deposit account). 

^^Each Grantor agrees that it will not terminate any bank as a Pledged Account Bank or terminate any Account Collateral, except that the Grantor may terminate a deposit account and terminate a bank as a Pledged Account Bank with respect to such deposit account if it gives the Agent at least 10 Business Days’ prior written notice of such termination (and upon such termination, Schedule II hereto shall be automatically amended to delete such Pledged Account Bank and such deposit account). Upon any termination by a Grantor of any deposit account or any Pledged Account Bank with respect thereto, such Grantor will immediately (i) transfer all funds and property held in such terminated deposit account to another deposit account listed in Schedule II and (ii) notify all Obligors that were making payments to such deposit account to make all future payments to another deposit account listed in Schedule II or to the Collateral Account, in each case so that the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, will have a continuously perfected security interest in such Account Collateral, funds and property. 

^Investing of Amounts in the Collateral Account. Upon the existence and continuation of an Event of Default, the Agent may, subject to the provisions of Sections 5, 7 and 22, from time to time (a) invest, or direct the applicable Pledged Account Bank to invest, amounts received with respect to the Collateral Account in such Cash Equivalents credited to the Collateral Account as the Borrower may select and the Agent may approve, and (b) invest interest paid on the Cash Equivalents referred to in clause (a) above, and reinvest other proceeds of any such Cash Equivalents that may mature or be sold, in each case in such Cash Equivalents credited in the same manner. Interest and proceeds that are not invested or reinvested in Cash Equivalents as provided above shall be deposited and held in the Collateral Account. In addition, upon the existence and continuation of an Event of Default, the Agent shall have the right at any time to exchange, or direct the applicable Pledged Account Bank to exchange, such Cash Equivalents for similar Cash Equivalents of smaller or larger determinations, or for other Cash Equivalents, credited to the Collateral Account. 

^Release of Amounts. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Agent will pay and release, or direct the applicable Pledged Account Bank to pay and release, to the applicable Grantor or at its order or, at the request of such Grantor, to be applied to the Obligations of the Grantors under the Loan Documents, all amounts then due and payable under the Loan Documents together with all accrued and unpaid interest and fees under the Credit Agreement; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing herein shall, absent the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, limit any Grantor’s right to direct each Pledged Account Bank directly. 

^Representations and Warranties. Each Grantor represents and warrants as follows: 

^^Such Grantor’s exact legal name, location, chief executive office, type of organization, jurisdiction of organization and organizational identification number is set forth in Schedule V hereto. Such Grantor has no tradenames, as of the date hereof other than those listed on Schedule V hereto.

^^Such Grantor is not, as of the date hereof, a beneficiary or assignee under any letter of credit, other than the letters of credit described in Schedule VIII hereto and other letters of credit as to which such Grantor has complied with the requirements of Section 16. 

^^This Agreement creates in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties a valid security interest in the Collateral granted by such Grantor, securing the payment of the Secured Obligations; all UCC filings and any filings with the Register of Copyrights or the Patent and Trademark Office necessary to perfect the security interest in the Collateral granted by such Grantor and that can be perfected by such action have been duly made or taken (or substantially simultaneously with the date hereof shall be) and are in full force and effect and such security interest is first priority (subject to the Liens permitted under the Credit Agreement). 

^^No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for (i) the grant by such Grantor of the security interest granted hereunder or for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by such Grantor (except as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect), (ii) the perfection or maintenance of the security interest created hereunder (except for (A) the filing of financing and continuation statements under the UCC, which financing statements have been duly filed or will be duly filed immediately after the date hereof, (B) the recording of the Intellectual Property Security Agreements with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S. Copyright Office, which Agreements have been duly recorded or will be delivered for recording immediately after the date hereof in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the U.S. Copyright Office and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Agent, any other governmental authorities necessary to perfect the security interest granted in the Intellectual Property Collateral, (C) the actions described in Section 4 with respect to the Security Collateral, which actions have been taken in compliance therewith and are in full force and effect, and (D) other actions taken in connection with the perfection or maintenance of the Liens created under this Agreement), or (iii) the exercise by the Agent of its voting or other rights provided for in this Agreement or the remedies in respect of the Collateral pursuant to this Agreement (except as may be required in connection with the disposition of any portion of the Security Collateral by laws affecting the offering and sale of securities generally and consent from the FCC in connection with the exercise of certain remedies). 

^^The Inventory that has been produced or distributed by such Grantor has been produced in compliance with all requirements of applicable law, including, without limitation, the Fair Labor Standards Act, other than could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^As to itself and its material Intellectual Property Collateral: 

^^^To such Grantor’s knowledge, the operation of such Grantor’s business as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted and the use of the material Intellectual Property Collateral in connection therewith do not, in any material respect, conflict with, infringe, misappropriate, dilute, misuse or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. 

^^^Such Grantor is the exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to the material Intellectual Property Collateral (other than Intellectual Property Collateral used by such Grantor pursuant to an IP Agreement), and is entitled to use all Intellectual Property Collateral subject only to the terms of the IP Agreements. 

^^^The Intellectual Property Collateral set forth on Schedule III hereto includes all of the registered patents, patent applications, domain names, trademark registrations and applications, copyright registrations and applications and IP Agreements owned by such Grantor as of the date hereof.

^The Agent’s Duties. 

^^The powers conferred on the Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Parties’ interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not any Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property.

The Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. 

^^Any cash held by or on behalf of the Agent and all cash proceeds received by or on behalf of the Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of the Agent, be held by the Agent as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the Agent pursuant to Section 23) in whole or in part by the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in Section 11.3 of the Credit Agreement. 

Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by or on the behalf of the Agent and remaining after payment in full of all the Secured Obligations shall be paid over to the applicable Grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

^^Each Grantor acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount of damages that would be suffered by the Secured Parties by reason of the failure by such Grantor to perform any of the covenants contained in subsection (f) above and, consequently, agrees that, if such Grantor shall fail to perform any of such covenants, it will pay, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the value of the Security Collateral on the date the Agent shall demand compliance with subsection (f) above. 

^Indemnity and Expenses. Each Grantor agrees to indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless each Secured Party and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, members, employees, agents and advisors as set forth in Section 14 of the Credit Agreement.

^^No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Agent and each Grantor affected thereby, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No failure on the part of the Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 

^^Upon the execution and delivery by any Person of a security agreement supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto (each a “Security Agreement Supplement”), such Person shall be referred to as an “Additional Grantor” and shall be and become a Grantor hereunder, and each reference in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to “Grantor” shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Grantor, each reference in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the “Collateral” shall also mean and be a reference to the Collateral granted by such Additional Grantor and each reference in this Agreement to a Schedule shall also mean and be a reference to the schedules attached to such Security Agreement Supplement.
