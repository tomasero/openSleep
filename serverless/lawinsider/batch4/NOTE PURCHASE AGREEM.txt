In the event any insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of a Loss Payment hereunder in respect of the Claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party regarding the amount of such Loss Payment.
