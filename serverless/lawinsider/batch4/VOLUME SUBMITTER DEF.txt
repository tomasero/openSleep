^Instead of specifying a percentage of Compensation, a Participant’s salary reduction agreement may specify a dollar amount to be contributed each payroll period, provided such dollar amount does not exceed the maximum percentage of Compensation specified in Subsection 5.03(a) of the Basic Plan Document or in Subsection 1.07(a)(1)(A) above, as applicable.

(C)A Participant may increase or decrease, on a prospective basis, his salary reduction agreement percentage or, if Roth 401(k) Contributions are selected in Subsection 1.07(a)(5) below, the portion of his Deferral Contributions designated as Roth 401(k) Contributions (check one):

If the Administrator anticipates that the Plan will not satisfy the “ADP” and/or “ACP” test for the year, the Administrator may reduce the rate of Deferral Contributions of Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees to an amount objectively determined by the Administrator to be necessary to satisfy the “ADP” and/or “ACP” test.

(5)**Roth 401(k) Contributions.** Participants shall be permitted to irrevocably designate pursuant to Subsection 5.03(b) of the Basic Plan Document that a portion or all of the Deferral Contributions made under this Subsection 1.07(a) are Roth 401(k) Contributions that are includable in the Participant’s gross income at the time deferred***.***

% of the next % of the Active Participant’s Compensation contributed to the Plan,

Upon making such an election, the EACA Participant’s Deferral Contribution election will be set to zero until such time as the EACA Participant’s Deferral Contribution rate has changed pursuant to Section 1.07(a)(1) or this Addendum.

(B)The amount of such withdrawal shall be equal to the amount of the EACA Deferrals through the end of the fifteen day period beginning on the date the Participant makes the election described in (A) above, adjusted for allocable gains and losses to the date of such withdrawal.

(C)Any amounts attributable to Employer Matching Contributions allocated to the Account of an EACA Participant with respect to EACA Deferrals that have been withdrawn pursuant to this Section (e)(1) shall be forfeited. In the event that Employer Matching Contributions would otherwise be allocated to the EACA Participant’s Account with respect to EACA Deferrals that have been so withdrawn, the Employer shall not contribute such Employer Matching Contributions to the Plan.

(2)An Active Participant who is otherwise covered by the EACA but who makes an affirmative election regarding the amount of Deferral Contributions shall remain covered by the EACA solely for purposes of receiving any required notice from the Plan Administrator in connection with the EACA and for purposes of determining the period applicable to the distribution of certain excess contributions pursuant to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 of the Basic Plan Document.

The QACA and/or EACA described in the previous sections of this PPA Addendum shall cover only those Active Participants eligible to affirmatively elect to make Deferral Contributions described below (Check all that apply. If Option (e)(1), Permissible Withdrawal, has been selected by the Employer, then all Employees subject to an automatic enrollment arrangement through the Plan must be covered by the EACA.):

(g)o  ***Qualified Reservist Distribution.*** A Participant called to active duty after [[Date 10: Date]] for a period that is either indefinite or to exceed 179 days and the Participant takes the distribution between the date of the call to active duty and the close of the active duty period. The distribution may be made only from amounts attributable to 401(k) deferrals and is exempt from the [[Percentage 5]]% income tax penalty that would otherwise apply if the Participant has not yet attained age 59-1/2. The PPA would further permit the Participant to repay the distribution to an IRA only (not to the plan) within two years after the end of the active duty period.
