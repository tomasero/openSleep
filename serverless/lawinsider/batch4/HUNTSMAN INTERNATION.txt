^*Registration Under the Securities Act*.

^^Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Company and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to file under the Securities Act a registration statement relating to offers to exchange (such registration statement, the “Exchange Registration Statement,” and such offers, collectively, the “Exchange Offer”) any and all of the Registrable Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities issued by the Company and guaranteed by the Guarantors, which debt securities and guarantee are substantially identical to the Securities and the related Guarantees, respectively (and are entitled to the benefits of a trust indenture which is substantially identical to the Indenture and which has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions for registration rights or the Special Interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such new debt securities and guarantee hereinafter called “Exchange Securities”). The Company and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act no later than [[Date 3: Date]]. The Exchange Offer will be registered under the Securities Act on the appropriate form and will comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The Company further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to commence and complete the Exchange Offer within 45 days after the date the Exchange Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission, hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 20 days (or longer if required by applicable law) andexchange Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been “completed” only if the debt securitiesand related guarantee received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act and without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a substantial majority of the States of the United States of America, it being understood that broker-dealers receiving Exchange Securities will be subject to certain prospectus delivery requirements with respect to resale of the Exchange Securities. The Exchange Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Company having exchanged the Exchange Securities for all outstanding Registrable Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer and (ii) the Company having exchanged, pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Exchange Offer, which shall be on a date that is at least 20 days following the commencement of the Exchange Offer. The Company and the Guarantors agree (x) to include in the Exchange Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange Securities that is a broker-dealer and (y) to keep such Exchange Registration Statement effective for a period (the “Resale Period”) beginning when Exchange Securities are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 120th day after the Exchange Offer has been completed or such time as such broker-dealers no longer own any Registrable Securities. With respect to such Exchange Registration Statement, such holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e) hereof.

Each holder that participates in the Exchange Offer will be required, as a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer, to represent to the Company in writing (which may be contained in the applicable letter of transmittal) (i) that any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) that at the time of the commencement of the Exchange Offer, such holder has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities in violation of the Securities Act, (iii) that such holder is not an “affiliate” of the Company as such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act, (iv) if such holder is a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of Exchange Securities; and (v) if such holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities (an “Exchanging Dealer”), that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with the resale of such Exchange Securities. A broker-dealer that is not able to make the representation in clause (v) above will not be permitted to participate in the Exchange Offer.

^^If on or prior to the time the Exchange Offer is completed, any law or the existing Commission interpretations are changed such that (i) the debt securities or the related guarantee received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities are not or would not be, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act, (ii) for any other reason the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 45 days after [[Date 3]] or (iii) the Exchange Offer is not available to any holder of the Securities by reason of U.S. law or Commission policy (other than due solely to the status of such holder as an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or as an Exchanging Dealer), the Company and the Guarantors shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause (iii), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 2(a), file under the Securities Act as soon as practicable, and cause to become or be declared effective no later of 90 days after the time such obligation to file arises, a “shelf” registration statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission (such filing, the “Shelf Registration” and such registration statement, the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Company and the Guarantors agree to use its reasonable best efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Effective Time or such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding; *provided*, *however*, that (I) no holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder is an Electing Holder and (II) the Company shall be permitted to take any action that would suspend the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement or result in holders covered by a Shelf Registration Statement not being able to offer and sell such Securities if (i) such action is required by law or (ii) such action is taken by the Company in good faith and for valid business reasons involving a material undisclosed event, and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement, within 30 days following the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably necessary to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement; *provided, however,* that nothing in this clause (y) shall relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii) hereof. The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company agrees to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing with the Commission.

^^In the event that (i) the Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective or been declared effective by the Commission on or before the date on which such registration statement is required to become or be declared effective pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 45 business days after the initial effective date of the Exchange Registration Statement relating to the Exchange Offer (if the Exchange Offer is then required to be made) or (iii) any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter either be withdrawn by the Company or shall become subject to an effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as specifically permitted herein) without being succeeded immediately by an additional registration statement filed and declared effective (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv), a “Registration Default” and each period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a “Registration Default Period”), then, as liquidated damages for such Registration Default, subject to the provisions of Section 9(b), special interest (“Special Interest”), in addition to the Base Interest, shall accrue at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% for the first 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 2: Number]]% for the second 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% for the third 90 days of the Registration Default Period and at a per annum rate of [[Percentage 4: Number]]% thereafter for the remaining portion of the Registration Default Period; *provided, however*, that Special Interest shall not accrue if the failure of the Company to comply with its obligations hereunder is a result of the failure of any of the holders, underwriters, Purchasers or placement or sales agents to fulfill their respective obligations hereunder; and *provided*, *further*, Special Interest shall only accrue until, but excluding, the earlier of (1) the date on which such Registration Default has been cured or (2) the date on which the Securities accruing such Special Interest cease to be Registrable Securities. Special Interest accrued for any period shall be payable at the relevant interest payment date for such period under the terms of the applicable series of Securities.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) the amount of Special Interest that accrues will not increase because more than one Registration Default has occurred and is pending; (2) a holder of Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities who is not entitled to the benefits of the Shelf Registration Statement (including, but not limited to any such holder who has not returned a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii) hereof) will not be entitled to Special Interest with respect to a Registration Default that pertains to the Shelf Registration Statement; and (3) a holder of Registrable Securities constituting an unsold allotment from the original sale of the notes or who otherwise is not entitled to participate in the Exchange Offer will not be entitled to the accrual of Special Interest by reason of a Registration Default that pertains to the Exchange Offer.

^^The Company shall take, and shall cause the Guarantors to take, all actions necessary or advisable to be taken by it to ensure that the transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated, including all actions necessary or desirable to register the Guarantees under the registration statement contemplated in Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof, as applicable.

^^Any reference herein to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time.

^*Registration Procedures.*

^*Representations and Warranties*.

The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to, and agree with, each Purchaser and each of the holders from time to time of Registrable Securities that:

^^Each registration statement covering Registrable Securities and each prospectus (including any preliminary or summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(d) or Section 3(c) hereof and any further amendments or supplements to any such registration statement or prospectus, when it becomes effective or is filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and at all times subsequent to the Effective Time when a prospectus would be required to be delivered under the Securities Act, other than from (i) such time as a notice has been given to holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(D) or Section 3(c)(iii)(D) hereof until (ii) such time as the Company furnishes an amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to Section 3(e) or Section 3(c)(iv) hereof, each such registration statement, and each prospectus (including any summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(d) or Section 3(c) hereof, as then amended or supplemented, will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; *provided*, *however*, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities, a placement or sales agent or an underwriter expressly for use therein.

^^Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and, as of such effective or filing date, none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; *provided, however,* that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities, a placement or sales agent or an underwriter expressly for use therein.

^^The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is subject, except for such conflict, breach or default which (x) would not have a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such event, a “Material Adverse Effect”) or (y) have been waived nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the organizational documents of the Companyor the Guarantors or violate any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties except for such violation which would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by the Company and the Guarantors of the transactions contemplated by this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Securities, qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the offering and distribution of the Securities.

^^This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantors.

^*Indemnification*.

^^*Indemnification by the Company and the Guarantors.* The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Registration Statement, each broker dealer selling Exchange Securities during the Resale Period, and each of the Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such holder for any out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; *provided, however,* that (i) neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any holder, placement or sales agent or underwriter expressly for use therein and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any holder, placement agent or underwriter (or any person controlling such person) to the extent that any loss, claim, damage or liability of such person results from the fact that such person sold Securities to a person as to whom it shall be established that there was not sent or given, a copy of the final prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented) at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person if (x) the Company has previously furnished copies thereof in sufficient quantity to such indemnified person and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such indemnified person results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus which was corrected in the final prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented) and (y) such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense would have been eliminated by the delivery of such corrected final prospectus or the final prospectus as then amended or supplemented.

^^*Indemnification by the Holders and Any Agents and Underwriters.* As a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof or to entering into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, each Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities and each underwriter named in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, will (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company,  the Guarantors, and all other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company,  the Guarantors or such other holders of Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder or underwriter expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and the Guarantors for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; *provided, however,* that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder’s Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration.

^^*Notices of Claims, Etc.* Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) above. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section 6(c) for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^^*Contribution.* If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) above are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders’ and any underwriters’ obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.

^^The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantors and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or a Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act.

^*Underwritten Offerings*.

^^*Selection of Underwriters.* If any of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company.

^^*Participation by Holders.* Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder’s Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

^*Rule 144*.

The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder’s sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

^*Miscellaneous*.

^^*No Inconsistent Agreements.*  The Company represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that it has not granted, and shall not grant, registration rights with respect to Registrable Securities or any other securities which would be inconsistent with the terms contained in this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement.

^^*Remedy.* Special Interest pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof is the sole remedy available to holders of Registrable Securities in the event the Company does not comply with any of its registration and other obligations set forth in Section 2 herein. In addition, the parties hereto acknowledge that there would be no adequate remedy at law if the Company fails to perform any of its other obligations under Sections 4, 6, or 8 hereunder and that the Purchasers and the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and accordingly agree that the Purchasers and such holders, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of such obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, in any court of the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction.

^^*Notices.*  All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered by hand, if delivered personally, by facsimile or by courier, or three days after being deposited in the mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested) as follows: If to the Company, to it at [[Address 2: Address]], Attention: General Counsel, and if to a holder, to the address of such holder set forth in the security register or other records of the Company, or to such other address as the Company or any such holder may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

^^*Parties in Interest.* All the terms and provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities and the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto and such holders.
