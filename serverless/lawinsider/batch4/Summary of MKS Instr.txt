\centered **Summary of [[Organization 1 Name]]’s**  **2010 Management Incentive Bonus** 

The 2010 Management Incentive Bonus Plan is based on 2010 corporate pro-forma pre-tax operating income targets. In 2010, the plan will have two parts  an annual component and a 6-month component. 

***Annual Component***  

The annual bonus plan formula is calculated as follows: 

Base Salary x Individual Incentive Target x Annual Corporate Performance Multiplier 

The “Annual Corporate Performance Multiplier” ranges from [[Percentage 1: Number]]% to [[Percentage 2: Number]]%, depending upon achievement of the specified corporate goal. Accordingly, the maximum payout possible for each of the participants is [[Percentage 2]]% of his respective Individual Incentive Target set forth below and the minimum payout is zero, with incremental payouts for performance between these levels. 

The following chart summarizes the Individual Incentive Targets for each of the Company’s “named executive officers” under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, plus [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]], who became our Chief Financial Officer on [[Date 1: Date]]. 

Individual Incentive Target Participant    (% of annual base earnings) [[Person 2 First Name]] [[Person 2 Last Name]]        % [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]]        % [[Person 3 First Name]] [[Person 3 Last Name]]        % [[Person 4 First Name]] [[Person 4 Last Name]]        % [[Person 5 First Name]] [[Person 5 Last Name]]        % [[Person 6 First Name]] [[Person 6 Last Name]]        %  

***Six-Month Component***  

In 2010, the Company will also have a six-month bonus plan, which relates to the Company’s achievement in the first six months of 2010. The six-month bonus plan formula is calculated as follows: 

Base Salary x Individual Incentive Target x Six-Month Corporate Performance Multiplier 

The “Six-Month Corporate Performance Multiplier” ranges from [[Percentage 1]]% to [[Percentage 3: Number]]%, depending upon achievement of the specified corporate goal. Accordingly, the maximum payout possible for each of the participants is [[Percentage 3]]% of his respective Individual Incentive

\centered **2010 MKS Bonus Plans** 

The MKS Annual Bonus Plan (The Plan) is based on fiscal year performance (January through December). The special MKS Mid-Year Bonus Plan is based on performance from January through June. Performance measurements are set at the beginning of the fiscal year. 

Plan participants have [[Percentage 5]]% of their bonus tied to achievement of corporate goals. 

**Participation/Approval:**  
Participation in the Plan requires the approval of the most senior individual in each organization as well as Human Resources and the Chief Executive Officer and President. Participation in the plan is reviewed on an annual basis. 

**Target:**  
Bonus target guidelines are established for positions as a percentage of pay. 

**Payout:**  
The bonus payout amount is a percentage of eligible W-2 earnings received during the plan period, i.e.“base salary” including regular, holiday, vacation, sick, and retro pay. Bonus payments attributable to the prior year or paid mid-year in 2010 are excluded from this calculation. 

**Administration:**  
Bonus payout is made as soon as possible after the end of the fiscal year and the performance assessment has been completed, but in no event later than [[Date 5: Date]] of the subsequent year. Bonus payout for the mid-year bonus plan will be made as soon as possible, but in no event later than [[Date 6: Date]].
