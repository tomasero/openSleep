\centered **Severance Agreement**

As of 1 [[Date 1: Date]]

Dear Kevin:

This letter sets forth our understanding and agreement with respect to your employment by [[Organization 1 Name]] (individually and, as the context may require, together with all of its parent companies, subsidiaries and related entities, “**Sotheby’s**” or the “**Company**”). 

^Term of Employment You agree to act as a full-time employee of the Company and the Company agrees to employ you full-time from [[Date 2: Date]] through and including [[Date 3: Date]] (the “**Term**”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (this “**Agreement**”).

^Title; Responsibilities

As Chief Executive Officer, Asia, you will be responsible for developing and executing the strategic plan for expanding Sotheby’s business to capture the opportunities in collecting in Asia, with continued emphasis on China. This will involve developing relationships and networks with government officials, principals in the art business and collectors. You will continue to develop and execute the tactical objectives for each fiscal year, and to recruit, build, and manage our team in Asia. You will also be expected to develop relationships with clients and to initiate auction/private treaty transactions.

In addition to the foregoing, you agree to perform such other functions and responsibilities as may be reasonably requested by the Chief Operating Officer of Sotheby’s (the “**Chief Operating Officer**”) from time to time. During the Term, you shall devote all of your business time and efforts to the performance of your functions and responsibilities hereunder.

^Compensation. In consideration for the services to be rendered by you to the Company, you shall receive during the Term the following:

^^An annual base salary of HK$[[USD Value 1: Number]] which amount reflects the HK$[[USD Value 2: Number]] reduction in your annual base salary that you agreed to in [[Date 4: Date]]. Your salary shall be payable in appropriate installments to conform to the regular payroll dates for salaried personnel of the Company. Your base salary shall be reviewed, along with those other

senior executives whose salaries was similarly reduced in [[Date 5: Date]] to determine whether business conditions warrant the reinstatement of all or part of the salary reduction and from time to time thereafter if not fully reinstated at that time. Any reinstatement of all or part of the salary reduction shall be consistent with that of the other senior executives whose salary was reduced. In addition, your annual base salary shall be reviewed on an annual basis and shall be subject to such adjustment as the Chief Operating Officer shall determine to reflect your performance and responsibilities beginning with the regular review cycle in 2011. Notwithstanding the change in your base salary outlined above, the term “base salary” in Subparagraphs 13(a)(i), 13(a)(ii) and 13(b) shall mean HK$[[USD Value 3: Number]] solely for the purpose of calculating any amount payable to you should you terminate your employment for Good Reason or the Company terminate your employment without Cause.

^^In addition to the annual base salary, you will be eligible for:

^^^An annual discretionary cash incentive bonus target of HK$[[USD Value 4: Number]] provided that you must be an employee of the Company at the time that any award is paid under the terms and conditions of the Sotheby’s Annual Incentive Compensation Program (or successor program) attached hereto as **Schedule 1**.

^^^An annual equity based incentive bonus target of US$[[USD Value 5: Number]] under the Company’s discretionary annual incentive compensation program (which may consist of an award or awards of any of the following: restricted stock units, performance share units and/or stock options) with any such award subject to the terms and conditions of the Sotheby’s Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Unit Plan and the 1997 Sotheby’s Stock Option Plan (or any successor plans), and the terms of any applicable award agreements The Sotheby’s Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Plan and the 1997 Sotheby’s Stock Option Plan are attached hereto as **Schedules 2 and 3** respectively.

^Pension.

^^You are eligible to join either the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme (“**MPF**”) or the Mandatory Provident Fund Exempted Occupational Retirement Scheme (“**MPF Exempted ORSO**”) maintained by the Company as particularly set out in **Schedule 4**.

^^The Company shall continue your enrollment in the provident fund scheme of your choice pursuant to Subparagraph (4)(a) above, and you shall give all necessary assistance to the Company to maintain such enrollment (including, but not limited to, signing any and all documents that the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion determine to be necessary to give full effect to the said enrolment). c)   The Company shall be entitled during the Term to make such deductions as may be authorized under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance (the “**Ordinance**”) from the salary payable to you, and shall make all necessary contributions to the provident fund scheme as prescribed under the Ordinance.

^^The Company shall inform you in writing of the amount of contributions made for, or in respect of, you to the provident fund scheme in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Ordinance.

^^The Company reserves the right to vary or discontinue any scheme in place from time to time.

^Benefits. You shall be entitled, to the extent that your position, title, tenure, salary, age, health and other qualifications make you eligible, to participate in all employee benefit plans or programs now in effect as set out in **Schedule 5** or hereafter adopted by the Company. Your participation in such plans or programs shall continue to be subject to the provisions, rules and regulations applicable thereto. Your former salary of HK$[[USD Value 3]] will be used as the basis for calculating benefits including life assurance and income protection but excluding pension.

^Vacation. During the Term, you shall be entitled, with full pay, to 20 days annual leave. Annual leave will be allowed and shall be taken in accordance with the established policies of the Company now or hereafter in effect.

^Expenses.

The Company will reimburse you for all such expenses upon presentation by you monthly of an itemized account of such expenditures, with appropriate receipts. Such expenditures, however, shall be subject at all times to the approval of the Company in accordance with the Company’s expense reimbursement policy.

^Housing Allowance. During the Term, HK$[[USD Value 6: Number]] of your annual base salary shall be attributable to rental reimbursement. To be eligible for rental reimbursement, you have to submit to the Company relevant copies of your rental agreements and rental receipts. The Company will then reimburse the rent you paid to your landlord up to a maximum of HK$[[USD Value 7: Number]] per month.

^Car Allowance. You will be provided with an annual car allowance of HK$[[USD Value 8: Number]] during the Term. This is taxable income to you.

Conflict of Interest Policy, House Rules and other Compliance Policies, as attached to **Schedule 6** (collectively, the “**Rules and Policies**”) and such other rules and policies as the Company may establish and/or amend from time to time. You acknowledge that you have read and understood each of the foregoing attached policies.

^Special Undertaking. You agree that during the Term, you shall refrain from any discussions, meetings or communications of any kind whatsoever with any other potential employer regarding prospective employment, including, but not limited to, an art auction house, art dealer or any other company, organization or entity in which you would perform similar duties and responsibilities to those you have performed at the Company, regarding prospective employment for yourself during the Term. You agree that during the Term you are knowingly and voluntarily foregoing the right to engage in such conduct in exchange for the consideration set forth herein, and you acknowledge the vital importance of this undertaking to the Company.

^Termination

^^This Agreement may be terminated:

^^^upon mutual written agreement of the Company and you; or

^^^at the option of the Company, for Cause (as hereinafter defined) summarily and without notice or payment in lieu of notice (but without prejudice to the rights and remedies of either party for any antecedent breach of this Agreement); or

^^^upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to you from the Company without Cause; or

^^^upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice by you for Good Reason (as hereinafter defined) within thirty (30) days of your becoming aware of the existence of circumstances constituting Good Reason; or

^^^upon one hundred eighty (180) day’s prior written notice (the “**Notice Period**”) by you to the Company without Good Reason unless such Notice Period or any portion thereof is waived by the Company; or

^^^at the option of the Company in the event of your Permanent Disability (as hereinafter defined); or

^^^automatically upon your death.

^^As used herein, the term “**Cause**” shall mean the happening of any of the following events:

^^^if you are convicted of a felony crime; or ii)   if you are guilty of grave misconduct, fraud, willful malfeasance or gross negligence in performance of your duties; or

^^^if you commit any continuing or material breach of your obligations under this Agreement and, in the case of a breach which is capable of remedy, fail to remedy the same within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice from the Company specifying such breach and the action required to remedy the breach; or

^^^if you conduct yourself otherwise than as befits your status as an employee of the Company or are guilty of conduct tending to bring yourself, the Company or any of the parent company or companies associated, affiliated, or connected, with, or to, the Company into disrepute; or

^^^if you commit an act of bankruptcy or compound with your creditors generally; or

^^^if you breach any of the provisions in Paragraph 10 or 11.

The Chief Operating Officer shall determine, in his sole discretion, whether the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event constitutes Cause within the meaning of this Agreement. Such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

^^As used herein, the term “**Good Reason**” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:

^^^any material breach of this Agreement by the Company; or

^^^the failure of the Company’s successor to assume this Agreement in accordance with Paragraph 23 without your express consent,

provided, however, that the Company shall have thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice from you of the existence of circumstances constituting Good Reason to correct such circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the prior reduction in your annual base salary from HK$[[USD Value 3]] to HK$[[USD Value 9: Number]] does not constitute Good Reason for purposes of this Agreement. d)   As used herein, the term “**Permanent Disability**” shall mean, and be limited to, any physical or mental illness, disability or impairment that has prevented you from continuing the performance of your normal duties and responsibilities hereunder for a period in excess of six (6) consecutive months.

^^^In the event the amounts you receive pursuant to Subparagraphs 13(a)(ii) and 13(a)(iii) total less than HK$[[USD Value 10: Number]] the Company shall pay you an amount equal to that difference that shall be calculated on your termination date. This amount shall be paid in a lump sum within fifteen (15) days after the requirements of Subparagraph 13(f) are fulfilled.

^^If during the Term, your employment is terminated on account of your Permanent Disability or your death, the Company shall pay or provide you (or, in the event of your death, your estate) with the amounts under the terms specified in Subparagraph 13(a)(i) above, Accrued Obligations, and equity based awards shall vest subject to the terms of the applicable plans (or successor plans) and/or award agreements.

^^Any payments payable pursuant to this Paragraph 13 beyond Accrued Obligations shall not be reduced, offset or prejudiced by any of your provident fund payments or entitlements.
