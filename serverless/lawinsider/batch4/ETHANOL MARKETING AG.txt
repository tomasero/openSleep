^[[Organization 2 Name]] desires to provide such marketing services in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

\centered **AGREEMENT**

NOW, THEREFORE,in consideration of the agreements and covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

\centered **MARKETING ACTIVITIES**

^^**Marketing of Ethanol Production**.  
^^Subject to the terms hereof, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall sell and make available for delivery and [[Organization 2 Name]] shall purchase and take delivery in accordance with Section 1.3 of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Ethanol produced by the Facility.

^^[[Organization 1 Name]] shall provide Ethanol to [[Organization 2 Name]] free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and otherwise operate the Facility as required to allow [[Organization 2 Name]] to perform its obligations hereunder.

^^[[Organization 2 Name]] shall perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with this Agreement, applicable Laws, applicable Permits and Good Industry Practice and with the intent to maximize the proceeds generated from the sale of Ethanol.

^^[[Organization 2 Name]] shall confer with [[Organization 1 Name]] no less frequently than weekly regarding marketing strategy. [[Organization 1 Name]] will have the option to participate in the “Pool” described in Section 2 herein by stating its election to participate on the execution of this Agreement.

^^[[Organization 1 Name]] shall provide [[Organization 2 Name]] with a best estimate of a projected Date of First Delivery covering a range of seven (7) days. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall use reasonable best efforts to update this estimate as more accurate information is available, but shall not be liable to [[Organization 2 Name]] for a failure to achieve the projected Date of First Delivery.

^^[[Organization 1 Name]] shall provide a best estimate of the amount of Ethanol production on a daily basis for the six (6) month period following the estimated Date of First Delivery. After the Date of First Delivery, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall provide monthly updates to [[Organization 2 Name]], by the 15th day of each month, estimating the daily production for the next six (6) month period beginning the first month following the date of the last estimate. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall promptly notify [[Organization 2 Name]] of any adjustments to the Ethanol production schedule that has been most recently given to [[Organization 2 Name]] or of any actual or anticipated production downtime or disruption to Ethanol availability.& #160; In the event (1) the Facility is unable to produce sufficient Ethanol quantities to meet the production estimates delivered to [[Organization 2 Name]], (2) such inability to produce is not the result of Force Majeure, and (3) [[Organization 2 Name]] would otherwise suffer a loss as a result of being unable to deliver Ethanol to a Third Party customer to whom [[Organization 2 Name]] is contractual committed to deliver Ethanol, then in such case [[Organization 2 Name]] may purchase or arrange for the purchase of such shortfall from other sources and incur additional transportation and similar expense to the extent necessary to cover contractual commitments [[Organization 2 Name]] has made in respect of [[Organization 1 Name]]’s anticipated production. [[Organization 2 Name]] shall use reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate the cost of such cover. [[Organization 2 Name]] will provide [[Organization 1 Name]] written substantiation of such costs reasonably satisfactory to [[Organization 1 Name]] as soon as reasonably possible.
