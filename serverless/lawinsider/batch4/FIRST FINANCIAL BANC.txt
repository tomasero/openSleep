^^**Federal Securities Laws or Other Applicable Law**. A Payment may be delayed where the Committee reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable law; provided that the delayed payment is made at the earliest date at which the Committee reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law.

^^**Other Events and Conditions**. A payment may be delayed upon such other events and conditions as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.

Neither the Company, the other members of the Affiliated Group, directors, officers, employees, advisers nor the Committee shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant or Beneficiary (or any other individual claiming a benefit through the Participant or Beneficiary) as a result of the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other guidance, promulgated with respect to such Section 409A by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service. For purposes of the Plan, the phrase "permitted by Section 409A of the Code," or words or phrases of similar import, shall mean that the event or circumstance shall only be permitted to the extent it would not cause an amount deferred or payable under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of a Participant or Beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

^^**TARP Policy****.** The Plan and the benefits provide under the Plan shall be subject to the [[Organization 1 Name]] TARP Policy, but only to the extent, and only for such period, as may be necessary to ensure the Plan and the benefits provided under the Plan comply with the applicable requirements of the TARP Compensation Standards. In the event that any provision of the Plan is found to be in conflict with the TARP Compensation Standards and/or TARP Policy, the Plan shall be deemed amended automatically, and to the extent necessary retroactively, to reflect the requirements of the TARP Compensation Standards, and the Plan shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.

^^**Consent to Compliance with the TARP Compensation Standards**. As a condition of participation in the Plan, each Participant shall acknowledge that (i) the benefits provided under the Plan may be subject to the TARP Compensation Standards and/or TARP Policy, (ii) the Plan may be amended and/or its administration modified in order to comply with the TARP Compensation Standards and TARP Policy, and (iii) a Participant shall be required (as determined by the Committee or the Board) to repay all amounts paid from the Plan that are later determined to have been paid in violation of the TARP Compensation Standards or TARP Policy.
