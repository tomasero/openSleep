^^^^^ 
^^Release. The Employee shall not receive any of the benefits set forth under Section 2.1 hereof, unless and until, the Employee furnishes the Company with an effective waiver and release of claims (the ***“Release”***) in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit A**. 

^^Termination for Death, Disability or Cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to entitle the Employee to any of the rights provided for in Section 2.1 hereof upon the termination of the Employee’s employment due to death, Disability or Cause. 

^^Parachute Payments.  
**2.4.1** Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any benefit the Employee would receive from the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (a “***Payment***”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “***Excise Tax***”), then such Payment shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The “***Reduced Amount***” shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion of the Payment, up to and including the total Payment, whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in the Employee’s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment, notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting “parachute payments” is necessary so that the Payment equals the Reduced Amount, the amounts payable or benefits to be provided to the Employee shall be reduced such that the economic loss to the Employee as a result of the “parachute payment” elimination is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero. 

**2.4.2** The Company shall appoint a nationally recognized independent accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder, which accounting firm shall not then be serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group that effected the Change in Control. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. 

**2.4.3** The accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and the Employee within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which the Employee’s right to a Payment is triggered (if requested at that time by the Company or the Employee) or such other time as requested by the Company or the Employee. If the accounting firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it shall furnish the Company and the Employee with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Employee that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment. The Company shall be entitled to rely upon the accounting firm’s determinations, which shall be final and binding on all persons. 

\centered 6. 

^^^^^ 
^^Mitigation; Exclusivity of Benefits. 

**2.5.1** The Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any benefits under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. The benefits to be provided pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof shall not be reduced by any compensation or benefits payable or provided to the Employee as a result of employment by another employer after the date of termination or otherwise. 

**2.5.2** The specific arrangements referred to in this Agreement are not intended to exclude any other benefits which may be available to the Employee upon a termination of employment with the Company pursuant to any other agreement between the Company and the Employee, including any employment or severance agreement. 

^**Withholding.**  
All payments required to be made by the Company under this Agreement to the Employee shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably determine should be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 

^**Nature of Employment and Obligations.** 

^^Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to create anything other than a terminable at will employment relationship between the Company and the Employee, and the Company may terminate the Employee’s employment at any time, subject to providing any benefits specified in this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and subject to any other agreement between the Company and the Employee. 

^^Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create or require the Company to create a trust of any kind to fund any benefits which may be payable under this Agreement, and to the extent that the Employee acquires a right to receive benefits from the Company under this Agreement, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. 

^**Assignment and Binding Effect.**  
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Employee and the Employee’s heirs, executors, personal representatives, assigns, administrators and legal representatives. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be assignable by the Employee. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors, assigns and legal representatives. The Company shall use its best efforts to require any successors and assigns to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to expressly assume and agree in writing to be bound by this Agreement and to perform the Company’s obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform such obligations had no succession or assignment taken place; provided that no such assumption or agreement by such successors and assigns shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

^**Integration.**  
Except as may otherwise be provided herein, this Agreement, including **Exhibit A,** contains the complete, final and exclusive agreement of the Parties relating to the terms and conditions contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements or arrangements between the Parties relating to the matters agreed to in this Agreement.

No provision of any future Equity Award, Equity Plan or other agreement between the Company and the Employee shall constitute a modification to any provision of this Agreement, even if such future provision is inconsistent with a provision of this Agreement, unless and only to the extent that such future provision specifically refers to this Agreement and includes a statement that the parties expressly intend to modify a provision of this Agreement. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the Parties with respect to any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement. 

^**Severability.**  
The finding by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authorized body of the unenforceability, invalidity or illegality of any provision of this Agreement shall not render any other provision of this Agreement unenforceable, invalid or illegal.

^**Section 409A.**  
This Agreement is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and shall be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder to the extent Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder apply to this Agreement.

In no event shall the Employee, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. Benefits payable under this Agreement will be subject to the distribution requirements of Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code, including, without limitation, the requirement of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code that payment to the Employee be delayed until six (6) months after separation from service if the Employee is a “specified employee” within the meaning of the aforesaid Section of the Code at the time of such separation from service. If Employee dies during the postponement period prior to the payment of postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the personal representative of Employee’s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of the Employee’s death.

In consideration of the benefits and mutual agreements set forth in the Change in Control Agreement dated **[**month**]**  _____, 20_____ (the ***“Agreement”***), between [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc, (the ***“Company”***)** and  (the ***“Employee”***), to which this form is attached, the Employee, intending to be legally bound, agrees to the following release and waiver (*Release and Waiver***): 

^In exchange for the consideration provided to the Employee by the Agreement that the Employee is not otherwise entitled to receive and the other commitments of the Company in the Agreement, the Employee and his or her heirs, representatives, agents and attorneys hereby generally and completely release the Company and its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, agents, attorneys, predecessors, successors, parent and subsidiary entities, insurers, affiliates and assigns from any and all claims, liabilities and obligations, both known and unknown, that arise out of or are in any way related to events, acts, conduct or omissions occurring prior to the Employee signing this Release and Waiver. This general release includes, but is not limited to: (1) all claims arising out of or in any way related to the Employee’s employment with the Company or the termination of that employment; (2) all claims related to the Employee’s compensation or benefits from the Company, including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, vacation pay, expense reimbursements, severance pay, fringe benefits, stock, stock options, or any other ownership interests in the Company; (3) all claims for breach of contract, wrongful termination, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (4) all tort claims, including, but not limited to, claims for fraud, defamation, emotional distress, and discharge in violation of public policy; and (5) all federal, state, and local statutory claims, including, but not limited to, claims for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, attorneys’ fees, or other claims arising under the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended), the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (as amended) (***ADEA***), and the Pennsylvania Fair Employment and Housing Act (as amended).

\centered 1. 

^^^^^ 
The Employee also acknowledges that he or she has read and understands Section 1542 of the Pennsylvania Civil Code which reads as follows: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” The Employee hereby expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits under that section and any law of any jurisdiction of similar effect with respect to any claims he or she may have against the Company. 

The Employee acknowledges that, among other rights, he or she is waiving and releasing any rights he or she may have under ADEA, that this Release and Waiver is knowing and voluntary, and that the consideration given for this Release and Waiver is in addition to anything of value to which he or she was already entitled as an employee of the Company.

^This Release and Waiver, including any referenced documents, constitute the complete, final and exclusive embodiment of the entire agreement between the Company and the Employee with regard to the subject matter hereof. The Employee is not relying on any promise or representation by the Company that is not expressly stated herein. This Release and Waiver may only be modified by a writing signed by both the Employee and a duly authorized member of the Board of Directors of the Company.
