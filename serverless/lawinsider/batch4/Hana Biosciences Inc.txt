For purposes of this letter, the term “cause” means any of the following actions committed by you:

^Willful and repeated failure, disregard or refusal by you to perform your employment duties;

^A material breach by you of any of your obligations under any other agreement or Hana policy, including, without limitation, Hana’s code of ethics, employee manual and any invention assignment, confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement(s).

For purposes of this letter, the term “good reason” means (i) a reduction in your annual base salary or annual target bonus rate or a material reduction in the benefits provided to you by Hana taken as a whole, in each case without your consent, but not if all senior executives of Hana incur any such reduction in compensation or other benefits; or (ii) a significant reduction in your duties and responsibilities; provided, however, that an event shall not constitute “good reason” unless you first notify Hana of such event in writing (including by email) within 30 days of the date you became aware of such event and the event is not corrected by Hana to your reasonable satisfaction within 30 days of the date of your written notice to Hana.
