During the 90 day period prior to its maturity date, Borrower may prepay without a Prepayment Fee (as defined below) the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, accrued interest and all other sums due and payable under the Loan Documents (the “**Indebtedness**”) on 30 days prior written notice to MetLife.

Upon the occurrence of any of these events Borrower will make monthly deposits of Impositions and/or insurance premiums, as applicable, notwithstanding the fact that the default may be cured, or that the transfer or change be approved by MetLife.

**METLIFE WILL BE ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH OTHER PARTIES IN RELIANCE UPON BORROWERS’ FULFILLMENT OF BORROWERS’ OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS APPLICATION, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE FIXING OF THE INTEREST RATE PRIOR TO THE FUNDING OF THE LOAN.

^^In the event that Market Capitalization is determined to be less than $[[USD Value 14: Number]] as of any reporting date required under the Loan Documents (the “MC Determination Date”), Borrower shall have 90 days from the MC Determination Date to commission and finalize appraisals by a third party valuation firm for use in determining [[Organization 6 Name]] Leverage Ratio. The valuation firm shall be subject to the prior written approval of MetLife, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisals which have been finalized by an approved third party valuation firm no later than 6 months prior to the MC Determination Date calculation shall be deemed valid for the determination of [[Organization 6 Name]] Leverage Ratio calculation.

^^Refinance of Existing Loan and Principal Paydown. This Loan is a refinance of MetLife’s existing loan number 390108 and loan number 701923 (the “Existing Loans”). At Closing, the Borrowers will be required to make a $[[USD Value 15: Number]] principal reduction payment (“Principal Reduction Payment”) on the Existing Loans. Such principal reduction payment shall be allocated to each of the individual Existing Loans in amounts to be determined by MetLife in its sole discretion. 

At Borrowers’ option, in lieu of making the Principal Reduction Payment at the Closing, Borrower may instead elect the following option (“Staged Paydown Option”): (i) at Closing make a principal reduction payment of $[[USD Value 16: Number]]; (ii) make principal reduction payments of $[[USD Value 17: Number]] each, both six months after Closing and twelve months after Closing and (iii) provide MetLife with two irrevocable, unconditional Letters of Credit issued by a bank and in a form approved by MetLife (“LOC”) totaling $[[USD Value 18: Number]]. One of the LOC’s shall be in the amount of $[[USD Value 17]] with a seven-month term, and the other LOC shall be in the amount of $[[USD Value 17]] with a thirteen-month term. In the event Borrowers select the Stage Paydown Option, then the Loan Amount will be increased to $[[USD Value 19: Number]]. The principal reduction payments described in this paragraph 16(k) may be made without any Prepayment Fee. In the event Borrowers elect the Stage Paydown Option, then the amount of the Debt Service Reserve (as described in Provision 16(n) hereof) shall be increased to $[[USD Value 20: Number]] and no amounts will be permitted to be withdrawn from the Debt Service Reserve unless and until the Liable Party has funded any debt service shortfalls in the aggregate amount equaling at least two months of debt service payments on the entire Loan. 

^^Partial Release. In connection with the sale of a Property, Borrower may obtain a release of that Property and a release of the Cross Loan Guaranty so long as: (aa) there shall be no Event of Default under the Transaction Documents; (bb) the loan-to-value ratio for the remaining Property shall not be greater than [[Percentage 4]]% as determined by MetLife in its sole and absolute discretion; (cc) the debt service coverage ratio for the remaining Property shall not be less than 1.50x as determined by MetLife in its sole and absolute discretion; (dd) Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by MetLife in connection with such release, including title insurance premiums, documentation costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees; (ee) the applicable Borrower shall pay the Loan Amount allocated to the Loan on the Property being released along with any other amounts due and payable on that Loan including without limitation the applicable Prepayment Fee, and (ff) Borrower shall be permitted to make a principal reduction payment on the Loan which is not being released (along with a Prepayment Fee) in order to meet the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratio tests set forth above. 

No release of a Property shall release Borrowers or Liable Party from their obligations under the Transaction Documents with respect to any events arising or occurring in whole or in part prior to the date of the release. 

^^Lock-Box Agreement. At Closing, Borrower shall deliver active present assignments (“Lock-Box Agreement”) executed by Borrower, Operating Lessees and each of the Managers to MetLife of all Borrower Distributions. Each Lock-Box Agreement shall provide that so long as no Monetary Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) or Pending Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) has occurred, then the amounts in the Lock-Box accounts shall be automatically distributed to each Operating Lessee and each Borrower; provided however that upon the occurrence of a Monetary Event of Default or a Pending Event of Default, MetLife shall have the right in its sole and absolute discretion to cease all further distributions from the Lock-Box accounts and further provided however that if a Pending Event of Default is cured prior to it becoming an Event of Default, then the amounts in the Lock-Box accounts shall again be automatically released to each Operating Lessee and each Borrower. “Monetary Event of Default” shall mean a failure by Borrower or Operating Lessee to pay or cause to be paid, when due, principal or interest on the Loans, Impositions, insurance premiums and amounts due to the Managers under the Management Agreements and a “Pending Event of Default” shall mean any event which, with the passage of time, would constitute a Monetary Event of Default. 

^^Debt Service Reserve. At Closing a “Debt Service Reserve” will be established with MetLife and funded in the amount of $[[USD Value 21: Number]] pursuant to a Debt Service Reserve Agreement satisfactory in form and substance to MetLife. Provided that there is no pending Event of Default under the Loan Documents or event with the giving of notice or the passage of time would be an Event of Default, the Debt Service Reserve shall be released (“Release Event”): (i) if after the date which is eighteen months following the Closing the “trailing” twelve-month net operating income (“NOI”) for the 

Property reaches $[[USD Value 22: Number]] as determined by MetLife in its sole and absolute discretion; or (ii) if after the date which is thirty-six months following the Closing the “trailing” twelve-month NOI for the Property reaches $[[USD Value 23: Number]] as determined by MetLife in its sole and absolute discretion (each a “Release Threshold”). In the event Rents and Income from the Property are not sufficient to pay Property operating expenses, required reserves and debt service, then Borrower shall be permitted to use the Debt Service Reserve for any debt service shortfalls. Borrower shall be required to submit evidence, satisfactory to MetLife in its sole discretion, that there is a debt service shortfall requiring the release of funds from the Debt Service Reserve. In the event any funds are withdrawn from the Debt Service Reserve, then the Liable Party shall be required to replace such withdrawn funds into the Debt Service Reserve within three months after the date of any disbursements. It shall be a recourse obligation of the Liable Party to replenish the Debt Service Reserve.
