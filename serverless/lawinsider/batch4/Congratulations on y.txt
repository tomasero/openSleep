You will not participate in any Novellus Profit Sharing or Bonus Programs. You will have the services of a company-paid financial advisor through [[Date 6: Date]] and of company-paid tax services for tax year 2010’s filing.

Upon the termination of your employment, you and eligible dependents will also receive medical, dental and vision coverage for life under Novellus’ “Officers’ Retirement Medical and Dental Coverage Plan,” as described in the plan which was approved by the Novellus board of directors in [[Date 7: Date]] and is attached to this agreement as Exhibit C. Under this plan, you and your spouse will receive medical, dental and vision coverage for your lifetime. Dependent children are eligible up to attainment of age as outlined in the plan document.

^Approval of Amended and Restated Executive Officers’ Medical and Dental Retirement Benefits 

Mr. Sherman explained that the Stock Option and Compensation Committee had recommended approval of an amended executive officers’ medical and dental retirement plan. Upon motion duly made and seconded, the resolutions attached hereto as Attachment No. 2 were approved. 

**Attachment No. 2** 

\centered **AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE** 

\centered **OFFICERS’ MEDICAL AND DENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS** 

WHEREAS, on [[Date 11: Date]] the Board of Directors (the “Board”), of the Company adopted a plan entitled Officers’ Retirement Medical and Dental Coverage (the “Plan”), all as set forth in the minutes of the meetings of the Board held on [[Date 11]] and a copy of the resolutions from each of such minutes is attached hereto as Appendix A; and 

WHEREAS, paragraph 4 of the Plan provides that the Board shall be entitled to amend the Plan at any time and in any respect provided that any such amendment shall not materially reduce the benefits available to any executive officer who is entitled to receive Benefits (as defined below) under the Plan and who has retired prior to the date of any such amendment; and 

WHEREAS, the Stock Option and Compensation Committee of the Board has recommended to the Board that the Board amend and restate the Plan in its entirety to provide as follows: 

^Joseph Dox, [[Person 4 First Name]] [[Person 4 Last Name]], and [[Person 5 First Name]] [[Person 5 Last Name]], who are the only former executive officers currently receiving Benefits under the Plan, shall be entitled to continue to receive such Benefits for the duration of their lifetime and the lifetimes of their spouses, if any, whichever is longer. 

^Robert Smith and [[Person 6 First Name]] [[Person 6 Last Name]], who are the only former executive officers who the Company has previously agreed will receive such Benefits upon the completion of their current employment contracts with the Company, shall be entitled to receive such Benefits for the duration of their lifetime and the lifetimes of their spouses, if any, whichever is longer. 

^John Chenault, [[Person 3 First Name]] [[Person 3 Last Name]], and Wilbert van den Hoek, who are the only current executive officers who the Company has determined will receive Benefits under the Plan upon their termination of employment with the Company notwithstanding the restrictions in paragraph (5) below which shall not apply to such executive officers, shall be entitled to receive such Benefits for the duration of their lifetime and the lifetimes of their spouses, if any, whichever is longer. 

^The coverage described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) above shall be available only to the designated current and former executive officers, their spouses, if any, and their dependent minor children, if any, and the covered executive officers shall be required to pay premiums for such coverage equal to the rates applicable to active employees and their spouses and dependents, as specified by the Company from time to time. 

^All other executive officers of the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933 shall be entitled to receive the Benefits described in paragraph (6) below upon their termination of employment with the Company for the duration of their lifetimes and the lifetimes of their spouses, if any, whichever is longer, provided that (i) the executive officer shall then be in good standing with the Company at the time of his or her termination; (ii) the executive officer’s attained age at his or her termination of employment with the Company is 60 or older; and (iii) the executive officer’s age plus years of service upon termination of employment with the Company equals 72 or more. Executive officers satisfying these criteria shall be referred to as “Eligible Retirees.” 

^The benefits provided under the Plan (“Benefits”) shall be determined by the Company, from time to time, in its sole discretion and shall extend to Eligible Retirees, their spouses, if any, and their dependent minor children, if any. The Company shall use its best efforts to secure an insurance contract or other arrangement that provides medical and dental coverage that is substantially comparable to that provided under the Company’s medical and dental benefit plans that apply to the Company’s active employees. Eligible Retirees shall be required to pay premiums for such coverage equal to the rates then applicable to active employees and their spouses and dependents. 

Although it is the current intent of the Board that the benefits under this Plan shall continue until the death of the Eligible Retiree and his or her spouse, the Board retains the power to amend or terminate the Plan at any time in its sole discretion except as otherwise provided herein. The Company shall be the “Plan Administrator” of the Plan in accordance with Section 402(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and in its capacity as Plan Administrator, the Company shall have full discretion to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, which interpretation or construction shall be final and binding on all parties, except as otherwise provided by law. The Plan Administrator may delegate responsibilities for the operation and administration of the Plan, may employ persons to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities under this program and may designate fiduciaries and allocate or reallocate fiduciary responsibilities under the Plan. 

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in the event an Eligible Retiree becomes employed or affiliated with a competitor of the Company, all benefits under the Plan will permanently cease. In addition, if an Eligible Retiree subsequently becomes covered by a group health plan or other similar arrangement providing medical and dental benefits maintained by a third party, both the Eligible Employee and his or her spouse, if any, will cease to be eligible to participate in the Plan while such other coverage remains in effect. For the purpose of the foregoing, independent consulting with a third party shall not be considered to be employment; provided, however, that consulting services performed by an Eligible Retiree for a competitor of the Company will cause the permanent cessation of benefits under the Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, a competitor of the Company will be deemed to be a company, division, or other business entity that is engaged in the manufacture of equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. 

The claims and appeals procedure that shall apply to benefit claims under the Plan shall be the claims and appeals procedure that exists under the Company’s medical benefits plan that applies to its active employees. 

All future benefits for any individual who is not a current or former executive officer of the Company and who is currently a participant in the Plan, including, without limitation, [[Person 7 First Name]] [[Person 7 Last Name]], shall cease as of [[Date 12: Date]].

^Medical and Dental Plans

The next topic for discussion was the Company’s medical and dental insurance plans. The Directors unanimously approved the following resolution: 

RESOLVED, that the resolution regarding officers’ retirement medical and dental coverage approved by this Board in its [[Date 13: Date]] meeting is hereby amended and clarified as follows: 

^^All benefits for eligible officers under this coverage shall be extended to the immediate families of such officers; 

^^The monthly payment required for such coverage shall be the same as that required from eligible full-time employees of the Company. 

\centered SCHEDULE A RESOLUTION REGARDING OFFICERS’ 

\centered RETIREMENT MEDICAL AND DENTAL COVERAGE 

RESOLVED: That the Board hereby adopts the following amended policy with respect to continuing medical/dental coverage of executive officers. 

^Eligible Officers: The policy shall apply to executive officers of the Company who are elected by the Board of Directors and have the title of Vice President or higher who retire from the Company after the date of this resolution and who (i) have reached the age of sixty-five at or prior to such retirement; (ii) have reached the age of fifty-five at or prior to such retirement and the sum of such officer’s age plus the full number of years of employment with the Company equals at least sixty-five or (iii) with the written consent of the President of the Company, such officer has reached the age of fifty and the sum of his age plus the years of service with the Company equals at least sixty-five. 

^Benefits Policy. Following the retirement of the eligible officer as defined above, such retired officer shall continue to be entitled to participation in the Company’s group medical and dental plans, as such plans may be amended from time to time prior to the executive’s retirement. Such participation shall entitle the retired officer, his or her spouse, and those other eligible dependents of such retired officer who were covered at the time of retirement to continue to be covered in the Company’s medical and dental plans as provided in this Paragraph 2. Alternatively, at the Company’s election, the retired executive shall be entitled to equivalent coverage. Such coverage shall continue for the remainder of the lifetime of the eligible officer and, as to his or her spouse, for such spouse’s lifetime if he or she shall survive the retired officer. 

^Termination of Coverage. Notwithstanding Section 2 above, upon employment or affiliation of an eligible officer with a competitor of the Company, all benefits under this policy will and permanently. In addition, in the event the retired executive shall come out of retirement to accept employment as an employee of a third party, and the executive is eligible to receive medical and/or dental benefits through the third party employer’s group plans, than the Company’s post-retirement medical coverage will stop until the executive resumes retirement. 

For the purpose of the foregoing, independent consulting shall not be considered employment with a third party in determining post retirement medical/dental coverage. However, consulting services performed for a competitor of the Company will cause the permanent termination of the benefit. For the purpose of the foregoing, a competitor of the Company shall be 

deemed to be a company, division or other business entity which is engaged in the manufacture of equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. 

^Amendment of Policy. The Board of Directors of the Company shall be entitled to amend this policy at any time and in any respect provided that such amendment shall not materially reduce the benefits available to any Eligible Officer who is entitled to receive benefits under the policy who has retired prior to the date of such amendment.
