^^upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, generally to sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise dispose of or deal with any of the Collateral in such manner as is consistent with the Uniform Commercial Code and as fully and completely as though Secured Party were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do, at Debtor’s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which Secured Party deems necessary or useful to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and Secured Party’s security interest therein, in order to effect the intent of this Agreement, all at least as fully and effectively as Debtor might do, including, without limitation, (i) the filing and prosec uting of registration and transfer applications with the appropriate federal, state, local or other agencies or authorities with respect to trademarks, copyrights and patentable inventions and processes, (ii) upon written notice to Debtor, the exercise of voting rights with respect to voting securities, which rights may be exercised, if Secured Party so elects, with a view to causing the liquidation of assets of the issuer of any such securities, and (iii) the execution, delivery and recording, in connection with any sale or other disposition of any Collateral, of the endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to such Collateral; and

^^to the extent that Debtor’s authorization given in Section 3 is not sufficient, to file such financing statements with respect hereto as Secured Party may deem appropriate.

^**Rights and Remedies**. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Secured Party, without any other notice to or demand upon Debtor, shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code and any additional rights and remedies which may be provided to a secured party in any jurisdiction in which Collateral is located, including, without limitation, the right to take possession of the Collateral, and for that purpose Secured Party may, so far as Debtor can give authority therefor, enter upon any premises on which the Collateral may be situate d and remove the same therefrom. Secured Party may in its discretion require Debtor to assemble all or any part of the Collateral at such location or locations within the jurisdiction(s) of Debtor’s principal office(s) or at such other locations as Secured Party may reasonably designate. Unless the Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Secured Party shall give to Debtor at least ten (10) Business Days prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale of Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition is to be made. Debtor hereby acknowledges that ten Business Days prior written notice of such sale or sales shall be reasonable notice. In addition, Debtor waives any and all rights that it may have to a judicial hearing in advance of the enforcement of any of Secured Party’s rights and remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, its right following an Even t of Default to take immediate possession of the Collateral and to exercise its rights and remedies with respect thereto.

^**Standards for Exercising Rights and Remedies**.

Debtor acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 16 is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by Secured Party would fulfill Secured Party’s duties under the Uniform Commercial Code or other law of the State of Utah or any other relevant jurisdiction in Secured Party’s exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by Secured Party shall not be deemed to fail to fulfill such duties solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 16. Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 16 shall be construed to grant any rights to Debtor or to impose any duties on Secured Party that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this Section 16.

^**No Waiver**. Neither party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any of its rights, interests or remedies in respect of the Obligations or the Collateral unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the waiving party. No delay or omission on the part of a party in exercising any right, interest or remedy shall operate as a waiver of such right, interest or remedy or any other right, interest or remedy. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right, interest or remedy on any future occasion. All rights and remedies of Secured Party with respect to the Obligations or the Collateral, whether evidenced hereby or by any other instrument or papers, sha ll be cumulative and may be exercised singularly, alternatively, successively or concurrently at such time or at such times as Secured Party deems expedient.

^**Suretyship Waivers by Debtor**. Debtor waives demand, notice, protest, notice of acceptance of this Agreement, notice of loans made, credit extended, Collateral received or delivered or other action taken in reliance hereon and all other demands and notices of any description. With respect to both the Obligations and the Collateral, Debtor assents to any extension or postponement of the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any security interest in any Collateral, to the addition or release of any party or person primarily or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payment thereon and the settlement, compromising or a djusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at such time or times as Secured Party may deem advisable. Secured Party shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of the Collateral or any income therefrom, the preservation of rights against prior parties, or the preservation of any rights pertaining thereto beyond the safe custody thereof as set forth in Section 11.2. Debtor further waives any and all other suretyship defenses.

^**Marshalling**. Secured Party shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully may, Debtor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or imped e the enforcement of Secured Party’s rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, Debtor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.

^**Proceeds of Dispositions; Expenses**. Debtor shall pay to Secured Party on demand any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by Secured Party in protecting, preserving or enforcing Secured Party’s rights and remedies under or in respect of any of the Obligations or any of the Collateral.

Upon the final payment and satisfaction in full of all of the Obligations and after making any payments required by Sections 9-608 or 9-615 of the Uniform Commercial Code, any excess shall be returned to Debtor. In the absence of final payment and satisfaction in full of all of the Obligations, Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency.

^**Overdue Amounts**. Until paid, all amounts due and payable by Debtor hereunder shall be a debt secured by the Collateral and shall bear, whether before or after judgment, interest at the highest default rate set forth in the Loan Documents.
