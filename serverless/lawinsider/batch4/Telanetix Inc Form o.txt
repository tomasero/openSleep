This Senior Secured Note (including all Senior Secured Notes issued in exchange, transfer or replacement hereof, this "**Note**") is one of a series of senior secured notes issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement on the Closing Date (collectively, the "**Notes**" and such Notes, other than this Note, the "**Other** Notes"). Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in Section 24.

^**PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL**. On the Maturity Date, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company and the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount in cash representing all outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest and accrued and unpaid Late Charges, if any, on such Principal and Interest (the "**Maturity Date Payment**"). The "**Maturity** **Date**" shall be [[Date 2: Date]]. On each Installm ent Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder an amount equal to the Installment Amount due on such Installment Date in accordance with Section 5. Other than as specifically permitted by this Note, the Company may not prepay any portion of the outstanding Principal, accrued and unpaid Interest or accrued and unpaid Late Charges, if any, on Principal and Interest.

^**INTEREST; INTEREST RATE**.  

^^Interest on the outstanding Principal amount of this Note shall commence accruing on the Issuance Date and shall be computed on the actual days lapsed based on a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar month during the period beginning on the Issuance Date and ending on, and including, the Maturity Date and on the Maturity Date (each, an "**Interest Date**" and the period between successive Interest Dates, an "**Interest Period"). The first Interest Date shall be [[Date 3: Date]].**

^^^On or prior to [[Date 4: Date]], Interest shall be payable on each Interest Date, to the record holder of this Note on the Record Date immediately preceding applicable Interest Date, in cash ("**Cash Interest**"); **provided**, however, that the Company may, at its option as indicated on the Interest Election Notice (as defined below), elect to pay the Interest by way of inclusion of the Interest in the outstanding Principal amount of this Note such that the outstanding Principal shall be increased by the amount of of such Interest on the applicable Interest Date("**PIK Interest**") on each Interest Date in accordance with Section 3(b)(i) or in a combination of Cash Interest and PIK Interest.. The Company shall deliver a written notice (each, an "**Interest Election Notice**") to each holder of the Notes on the twentieth (20th) calendar day of the applicable month for which such Interest Election Notice is being delivere d (the date such notice is delivered to all of the holders, the "**Interest Notice Date**") which notice (A) either (I) confirms that Interest to be paid on such Interest Date shall be paid entirely in Cash Interest or (II) elects to pay Interest as PIK Interest or a combination of Cash Interest and PIK interest and specifies the amount of Interest that shall be paid as Cash Interest and the amount of Interest, if any, that shall be paid as PIK Interest.

^^^From [[Date 4]] until the Maturity Date, Interest shall be payable on each Interest Date, to the record holder of this Note on the Record Date immediately preceding applicable Interest Date, as Cash Interest.

^^Prior to the payment of Interest on an Interest Date, Interest on this Note shall accrue at the Interest Rate and be payable by way of inclusion of the Interest in the Outstanding Amount. From and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Interest Rate shall be increased by four percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) per annum. For example, if the effective Interest Rate immediately prior to an Event of Default was seven percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) per annum, the interest rate would increase to eleven percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) per annum upon an Event of Default. In the event that such Event of Default is subsequently cured, the adju stment referred to in the first sentence of this Section 2(c) shall automatically cease to be effective as of the date of such cure; provided that the Interest as calculated at such increased rate that accrued from the date of such Event of Default through and including the date such Event of Default was cured, shall be the amount of Interest owed and payable in respect of such period.

^**RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT**.  

^^**Event of Default**. Each of the following events shall constitute an "**Event of Default**":

^^^the Company's failure to pay to the Holder any amount of Principal (including, without limitation, any redemption payments or Installment Amounts), Interest due in cash, Late Charges or any other amounts when and as due under this Note or any other Transaction Document (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), except, in the case of a failure to pay Interest and Late Charges when and as due, in which case only if such failure continues for a period of five (5) Business Days after notice of such failure;

^^^a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating in excess of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] are rendered against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and which judgments are not, within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof, bonded, discharged or stayed pending appeal, or ar e not discharged within sixty (60) days after the expiration of such stay; provided, however, that any judgment which is covered by insurance or an indemnity from a credit worthy party shall not be included in calculating the $[[USD Value 2]] amount set forth above;

^^^the Company breaches any covenant or other term or condition or any material representation or warranty of any Transaction Document, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant or other term or condition which is curable, and provided that the Company delivers prompt notic e of such breach to the Holder, only if such breach continues for a period of at least ten (10) consecutive Business Days;

^^^any breach or failure in any respect to comply with Section 5 or Section 10 (other than Sections 10(g)) of this Note;

^^^any provision of any Security Document (as determined by the Collateral Agent) shall at any time for any reason (other than pursuant to the express terms thereof) cease to be valid and binding on or enforceable against the Company or any Subsidiary intended to be a party t hereto, or the validity or enforceability thereof shall be contested by any party thereto, or a proceeding shall be commenced by the Company or any Subsidiaryor any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any of them, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability thereof, or the Company or any Subsidiary shall deny in writing that it has any liability or obligation purported to be created under any Security Document;

^^^the failure of the Company to meet [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of any of the Financial Targets for each quarterly period during the term of this Note; provided, however, that for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011, an Event of Default shall be dee med to occur only if the Company fails to meet (A) [[Percentage 4]]% of any of the Financial Targets set forth in Section 10(s)(i)(A), (B) or (C) for such quarter; (B) [[Percentage 4]]% of the Financial Target set forth in Section 10(s)(i)(D) for such quarter and the amount by which such Financial Target was missed exceeds $[[USD Value 2]] for such quarter; or (C) [[Percentage 4]]% of the Financial Target set forth in Section 10(s)(i)(E) for such quarter and the amount by which such financial target was missed exceeds $[[USD Value 2]] for such quarter; or

^^^any Event of Default (as defined in the Other Notes) occurs with respect to any Other Notes.

^^**Redemption Right**. (i) Upon the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Default with respect to this Note or any other Note, the Company shall redeem [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of the Outstanding Amount of this Note.

^^^Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default other than a Bankruptcy Default with respect to this Note or any Other Note, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) deliver written notice thereof via facsimile or e-mail and overnight courie r (an "**Event of Default Notice**") to the Holder. At any time after the earlier of the Holder's receipt of an Event of Default Notice and the Holder becoming aware of an Event of Default, the Holder may require, if such Event of Default is continuing, the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (the "**Event of Default Redemption Notice**") to the Company, which Event of Default Redemption Notice shall state the facts constituting the Event of Default and indicate the portion of this Note the Holder is demanding that the Company redeem.

^^^Each portion of this Note subject to redemption by the Company pursuant to this Section 3(b) shall be redeemed by the Company at a price equal to [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the Outstanding Amount to be redeemed (the "**Event of Default** Redemption Price"). Redemptions required by this Section 3(b) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 9. To the extent redemptions required by this Section 3(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Note by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. In the event of a partial redemption of this Note pursuant hereto, the Principal amount redeemed shall be deducted from the Installment Amounts in inverse order from the Maturity Date. The parties hereto agree that in the event of the Company's redemption of any portion of this Note under this Section 3(b), the Holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the Holder. Accordingly, any re demption premium due under this Section 3(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the Holder's actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.

^**RIGHTS UPON FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL**.

^^**Assumption**. The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction without the prior written consent of the Required Holders. In the event such consent is received, in addition to any other terms and conditions relating to such consent, the Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless the surviving entity of such Fundamental Transaction (the "**Successor Entity**") assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Doc uments in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders and approved by the Required Holders prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements to deliver to each holder of Notes in exchange for such Notes a security or securities of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument or instruments substantially similar in form and substance to the Notes, including, without limitation, having a principal amount or amounts and interest rate equal to the then current principal amounts and the then current interest rates of the Notes held by such holder and having similar ranking to the Notes. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Note referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every r ight and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Note with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. The provisions of this Section 4 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the redemption of the Notes.

^^**Holder Redemption Right**. No sooner than fifteen (15) days nor later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile (with confirmation of transmission) or e-mail and overnight courier to the Holder (a "**Change of Control Notice**"). In addition to any other rights granted in connection with obtaining the consent of the Required Holders, at any time d uring the period beginning on the date of the Holder's receipt of a Change of Control Notice and ending twenty (20) days after the consummation of such Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem (a "**Change of Control Redemption**") all or any portion of this Note at a price equal to [[Percentage 6]]% of the Outstanding Amount to be redeemed (the "**Change of Control Redemption Price**") by delivering written notice thereof ("**Change of Control Redemption Notice**") to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Outstanding Amount the Holder is demanding be redeemed.

^^**Redemptions Under This Section 4**. The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 4 shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at the Change of Control Redemption Price. Redemptions required by this Section 4 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 and shall have priority to payments to stockholders in connection with a Change of Control. To the extent redemptions required by this Section 4 are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Note by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments. In the event of a partial redemption of this Note pursuant hereto, the Principal amount redeemed shall be deducted from the Installment Amounts in inverse order from the Maturity Date. The parties hereto agree that in the event of the Company's redemption of any portion of the Note under this Section 4, the Holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this Section 4 as reflected in the Change of Control Redemption Price is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the Holder's actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.

^**INSTALLMENT AMOUNTS**.  

^^On each applicable Installment Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder of this Note the Installment Amount due as of such date. The Installment Amount shall be payable by the Company in cash on the applicable Installment Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

^^Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 5 to the contrary, the Holder may, at its option and in its sole discretion, deliver a notice to the Company at least two (2) days prior to any anticipated Installment Date electing to have the payment of all or any portion of an Installment Amount payable on the next Installment Date deferred to any futur e Installment Date as indicated in such Holder's deferral notice. Payment of any amount deferred to future Installment Date pursuant to this Section 5(b) shall be paid on such date in cash.

^**SUBSEQUENT PLACEMENT REDEMPTIONS**. At least ten (10) days but not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the Subsequent Placement shall be consummated, the Company shall provide the Holder with a written notice which shall state (x) the amount of the anticipated aggregate gross proceeds to be received by the Company from the Subsequent Placement and (y) the anticipated Subsequent Placement closing date. Upon the closing of such Subsequent Placement, the Company shall redeem a Principal amount of this Note equal to the product of the Holder Pro Rata Amount and $[[USD Value 3: Number]] (the "**Subsequent Placement Redemption Amount**"). The Subsequent Placement Redemption Amount shall be delivered in cash and shares of Common Stock (the "**Redemption Shares**") as follows:

^^The portion of the Subsequent Placement Redemption Amount that shall be delivered to each Holder in cash shall be the sum of: (i) the product of (x) the Holder Pro Rata Amount and (y) the Subscribed Amount, plus (ii) all accrued and unpaid Interest and Late Charges and any other amounts due in respect of the Principal amount being redeemed in cash; and

^^The portion of the Subsequent Placement Redemption Amount that shall be delivered to each Holder in Redemption Shares shall be an amount equal to a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the sum of (x) the product of the Holder Pro Rata Amount and the Unsubscribed Amount plus (ii) all accrued and unpaid Interest and Late Charges and any other amounts due in respect of the Principal amount being redeemed, and (ii) the denominator of which is the offering price in the Subsequent Placement; provided that there has been no Equity Conditions Failure. If an Equity Conditions Failure has occurred as of the closing date of the Subsequent Placement, unless the Holder waives such Equity Conditions Failure, no Redemption Shares shall be issued to the Holder in respect of such Principal amount to be redeemed. The Company shall have a period of 60 days to attempt to cure the Equity Conditions Failure. Upon cure the Company will issue to the Holder the Redemption Shares. If, at the end of a 60 day period, the Company has not cured the Equity Conditions Failure, such Principal amount being redeemed shall, at the election of the Holder either (i) be paid in cash at a price equal to the sum of the Principal amount being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid Interest and Late Charges and any other amounts due in respe ct of the Principal amount being redeemed, or (ii) such Principal amount being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid Interest and Late Charges shall continue to remain outstanding under the terms of this Note.

^**COMPANY REDEMPTION**. If at any time after the Issuance Date the Aggregate Net Return of the Holder exceeds the Aggregate Net Return Target, the Company shall have the right to require the Holder to cancel a Principal amount of this Note equal to the Outstanding Amount then remaining under this Note less the Unreleased Amount. This right may not be exercised more than once by the Company. The Company may exercise such right by delivering a written notice thereof via facsimile or e-mail and overnight courier to the Holder, which such notice shall i nclude evidence of such realized return in form and substance acceptable to the Holder. Upon receipt of such notice, the Holder agrees to immediately cancel the Outstanding Amount then remaining on this Note less the Unreleased Amount (the date of such cancellation, the "**Company Redemption Date**"). For purpose of this Section 7, "**Aggregate Net Return**" means the amount actually realized or deemed realized in accordance herewith by the Holder in connection with the Securities issued to the Holder pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement and "**Aggregate Net Realized Return Target**" means either (i) the Holder has received, in cash, an amount equal to [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of the sum of (x) Original Principal Amount of this Note on the Issuance Date plus (y) the amount of any interest that accrued and would have accrued under this Note at t he Interest Rate for the period from Issuance Date through the Maturity Date discounted to the present value of such interest using a discount rate equal to [[Percentage 8: Number]]%, less the amount paid pursuant to Section 6(a) of this Note if the payments pursuant to such Sections 6(a) were received on or before the Rights Offering Deadline (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) (collectively, the "**Principal Return**") or (ii) the Holder has received, in cash, an amount equal to [[Percentage 5]]% of the Principal Return and the Common Stock and the Redemption Shares held by the Holder may at the time of determination be sold without any Equity Conditions Failure for an amount equal to no less than [[Percentage 7]]% of the Principal Return.

^**NONCIRCUMVENTION**. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note.

Upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Default or upon the Company's receipt of the Holder's Event of Default Redemption Notice, the Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five (5) Business Days after such occurrence or receipt, as applicable ("**Event of Default Redemption Date**"). If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(b), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and within five (5) Business Days after the Company's receipt of such notice otherwise ("**Change of Control Default Redemption Date**"). In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Outstanding Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 13(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the applicable Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required, at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Outst anding Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid.

^^**Redemption by Other Holders**. Upon the Company's receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(b) (each, an "**Other Redemption Notice**"), the Company shall promptly, but no later than two (2) Business Days of its receipt thereof, forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice. If the Company receives a Redemption Notice and one or more Other Redemption Notices, during the seven (7) Business Day period beginning on and including the date which is three (3) Business Days prior to the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and ending on and including the date which is three (3) Business Days after the Company's receipt of the Holder's Redemption Notice and the Company is unable to redeem all principal, interest and other amounts designated in such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received during such seven (7) Business Day period, then the Company shall redeem a pro rata amount from each holder of the Notes (including the Holder) based on the principal amount of the Notes submitted for redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice and such Other Redemption Notices received by the Company during such seven Business Day period.
