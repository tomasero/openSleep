^^^**Company’s Response**. Upon receipt by the Company of copy of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall (I) as soon as practicable send, via facsimile, a confirmation of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms herein and (II) on or before the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of receipt by the Company of such Conversion Notice, (A) issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled, or (B) provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the holder shall be entitled to the holder’s or its designee’s balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. If the number of Series H Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Stock Certificate(s) submitted for conversion, as may be required pursuant to Section 2(d)(vii), is greater than the number of Series H Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Preferred Stock Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Preferred Stock Certificate representing the number of Series H Preferred Shares not converted.

^^^**Dispute Resolution**. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate, the Company shall instruct the Transfer Agent to issue to the holder the number of shares of Common Stock that is not disputed and shall transmit an explanation of the disputed arithmetic calculations to the holder via facsimile within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such holder’s Conversion Notice or other date of determination. If such holder and the Company are unable to agree upon the determination of the arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate within two (2) Business Days of such disputed arithmetic calculation being transmitted to the holder, then the Company shall within one (1) Business Day submit via facsimile the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Rate to the Company’s independent, outside accountant. The Company shall cause, at the Company’s expense, the accountant to perform the calculations and notify the Company and the holders of the results no later than two (2) Business Days from the time it receives the disputed calculations. Such accountant’s determination or calculation, as the case may be, shall be binding upon all parties absent error.

^^^**Record Holder**. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Series H Preferred Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date.

^^^**Pro Rata Conversion**. In the event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of Series H Preferred Shares for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Series H Preferred Shares, the Company shall convert from each holder of Series H Preferred Shares electing to have Series H Preferred Shares converted at such time a pro rata amount of such holder’s Series H Preferred Shares submitted for conversion based on the number of Series H Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the number of Series H Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date.

^^^**Redemption by the Company**.  
^At any time the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding Series H Preferred Shares (an“**Optional Redemption**”) for an amount in cash per Series H Preferred Share equal to $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (the “**Redemption Price**”).If the Company elects to conduct an Optional Redemption it shall deliver written notice to each holder of outstanding Series H Preferred Shares that will be redeemed (a“**Optional Redemption** **Notice**”),which shall state (x) the number of Series H Preferred Shares the Company has elected to redeem and (y) the date upon which the Optional Redemption shall occur (the “**Optional Redemption Date**”), which shall not be less than 20 days after the date of the Optional Redemption Notice. If the Company elects an Optional Redemption, then on the specified date the Company shall pay to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares with respect to which the Company has elected an Optional Redemption by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by such holder an amount per Series H Preferred Share selected for redemption equal to the Redemption Price. Each holder shall have the right to convert the holder’s Series H Preferred Shares prior to the Optional Redemption Date in accordance with the provisions herein.

^In the event that the Company: (i) fails to pay any Dividends to the holders of Series H Preferred Shares as required under this Certificate of Designations; or (ii) breaches any material representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Subscription Agreement pursuant to which any Series H Preferred Shares were issued or contained in this Certificate of Designations, and in either event of (i) or (ii), such failure or breach is not cured within fifteen (15) days after a holder of Series H Preferred Shares has delivered written notice of such failure or breach, as the case may be, to the Company (each, a “**Mandatory Redemption Event**”), then the Company will deliver written notice to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares of the occurrence of such Mandatory Redemption Event, and each holder of Series H Preferred Shares will have a thirty (30) day option to require the Company to redeem any or all Series H Preferred Shares owned by such holder at the Redemption Price, which notice by such holder shall be in writing (each, a “**Holder Notice**”), and shall be accompanied by a certificate(s) for the Series H Preferred Shares to be redeemed. The Company shall pay the Redemption Price for each Series H Preferred Share requested to be redeemed in a Holder Notice within thirty (30) days following the Company’s receipt of such Holder Notice, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by a holder in a Holder Notice. Any holder delivering a Holder Notice shall not be entitled to convert any Series H Preferred Shares requested by such holder to be redeemed by the Company without the prior written consent of the Company. In the event that a holder has requested less than all of the Series H Preferred Shares be redeemed then in the certificate delivered by such holder to the Company, then the Company shall as promptly as practicable following such redemption, cause the Company’s Transfer Agent to deliver to such holder a certificate evidencing the Series H Preferred Shares not so redeemed.

^^^**Book-Entry**. Unless otherwise specifically required herein, upon conversion of Series H Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the holder thereof shall not be required to physically surrender the certificate representing the Series H Preferred Shares to the Company unless the full or remaining number of Series H Preferred Shares represented by the certificate are being converted. The holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Series H Preferred Shares so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of the certificate representing the Series H Preferred Shares upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Company establishing the number of Series H Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Series H Preferred Shares represented by a certificate are converted as aforesaid, the holder may not transfer the certificate representing the Series H Preferred Shares unless the holder first physically surrenders the certificate representing the Series H Preferred Shares to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the holder a new certificate of like tenor, registered as the holder may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining number of Series H Preferred Shares represented by such certificate. The holder and any assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Series H Preferred Shares, the number of Series H Preferred Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Series H Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each certificate for Series H Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend:

ANY TRANSFEREE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY’S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE PREFERRED SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 2(d)(vii) THEREOF. THE NUMBER OF PREFERREDSHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF PREFERRED SHARES STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 2(d)(vii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE PREFERRED SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE.

^^**Adjustments to Conversion Price**. The Conversion Price will be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 2(f).

^^^**Adjustment of Standard Conversion Price Upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock**. If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares and the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased.

^^^**Other Events**. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 2(f) but not expressly provided for by such provisions, then the Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 2(f).

^^^**Notices**.  
^Promptly upon any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 2(f), the Company will give written notice thereof to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares, setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such adjustment. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of such adjustment, then such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2(d)(iii).

^The Company will give written notice to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (I) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common Stock and (II) for determining rights to vote with respect to any Organic Change (as defined in Section 3(a)), dissolution or liquidation, provided that such information shall be made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice being provided to such holder.

^The Company will also give written notice to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which any Organic Change, dissolution or liquidation will take place, provided that such information shall be made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice being provided to such holder.

^**Other Rights of Holders**.  
^^**Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale**. Any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to another Person or other transaction which is effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock is referred to herein as “**Organic Change.**”Prior to the consummation of any (i) sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assetsto an acquiring Person or (ii) other Organic Change following which the Company is not a surviving entity, the Company will secure from the Person purchasing such assets or the successor, or, if applicable, the parent of the successor, resulting from such Organic Change (in each case, the “**Acquiring Entity**”) a written agreement (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the holders of at least two-thirds of the Series H Preferred Shares then outstanding) to deliver to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares in exchange for such shares, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Series H Preferred Shares, including, without limitation, having a stated value and liquidation preference equal to the Stated Value and the liquidation preference of the Series H Preferred Shares held by such holder (except that such security may be pari passu, with but not junior to, any capital stock of such acquiring or successor Person). Prior to the consummation of any other Organic Change, the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that each of the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares will thereafter have the right to acquire and receive in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the conversion of such holder’s Series H Preferred Shares such shares of stock, securities or assets that would have been issued or payable in such Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock which would have been acquirable and receivable upon the conversion of such holder’s Series H Preferred Shares as of the date of such Organic Change (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Series H Preferred Shares).

^**Reservation of Shares**. The Company shall, so long as any of the Series H Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversions of the Series H Preferred Shares, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all of the Series H Preferred Shares then outstanding. The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Series H Preferred Shares and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares based on the number of Series H Preferred Shares held by each holder at the time of issuance of the Series H Preferred Shares or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be. In the event a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holder’s Series H Preferred Shares, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the number of reserved shares of Common Stock reserved for such transferor. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Series H Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Series H Preferred Shares, pro rata based on the number of Series H Preferred Shares then held by such holders.

^**Voting Rights**.  
^^Unless otherwise specifically required by the Act, the holders of Series H Preferred Shares shall vote on as as-converted basis and shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock and all other securities of the Company which vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single group and, with respect to the Preferred Members, on an as-converted basis, unless otherwise specifically required by the Act or this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any action to be taken by any group of Members as provided herein shall require the affirmative vote of a Required Interest of such group of Members.

^^As long as any Series H Preferred Shares are issued and outstanding, the holders of Series H Preferred Shares shall be entitled to elect one (1) director to the Board of Directors (the “**Series H Preferred Director**”). The Series H Preferred Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of holders of Common Stock or at any special meeting of holders of Series H Preferred Shares called for the purpose thereof or by the written consent of such holders, which election shall require a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series H Preferred Shares voting as a separate series. If the Series H Preferred Director should cease to be a director for any reason, the vacancy shall only be filled by the vote (or written consent) of a majority of the outstanding Series H Preferred Shares, voting as a separate series. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (b) to the contrary, when and as long as [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]] Living Trust U/A/D 01/12/1999 (the “**[[Organization 4 Name]]**”) owns any Series H Preferred Shares, then the [[Organization 4 Name]] shall be entitled to designate and elect the Series H Preferred Director.

^**Liquidation, Dissolution Winding-Up**. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive in cash out of the assets of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its shareholders (the “**Liquidation Funds**”),before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of the capital stock of the Company of any class junior in rank to the Series H Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to distributions and payments on the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, an amount per Series H Preferred Share equal to the Stated Value plus accrued but unpaid dividends; provided that, if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders of Series H Preferred Shares and holders of shares of other classes or series of preferred stock of the Company that are of equal rank with the Series H Preferred Shares as to payments of Liquidation Funds (the “**Pari Passu Shares**”), then each holder of Series H Preferred Shares and Pari Passu Shares shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such holder as a liquidation preference, in accordance with their respective Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights, as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to all holders of Series H Preferred Shares and Pari Passu Shares. The purchase or redemption by the Company of stock of any class, in any manner permitted by law, shall not, for the purposes hereof, be regarded as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Neither the consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other Person, nor the sale or transfer by the Company of less than substantially all of its assets, shall, for the purposes hereof, be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

^**Preferred Rank**. Other than the Company’s Series F Preferred Shares and Series G Preferred Shares, which shall rank pari passu with the Series H Preferred Shares, all shares of Common Stock and any other equity securities of the Company shall be of junior rank to all Series H Preferred Shares with respect to the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company. The rights of the shares of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Companyshall be subject to the preferences and relative rights of the Series H Preferred Shares. Without the prior express written consent of the holders of not less than fifty percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the Series H Preferred Shares then outstanding **and** each holder owning more than twenty percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the then outstanding Series H Preferred Shares, the Company shall not hereafter authorize or issue additional or other capital stock that is of senior or pari-passu rank to the Series H Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company. The Company shall be permitted to issue preferred stock that is junior in rank to the Series H Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company. In the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation, the Series H Preferred Shares shall maintain their relative powers, designations and preferences provided for herein (except that the Series H Preferred Shares may be pari passu with, but not junior to, any capital stock of the successor entity) and no merger shall result inconsistent therewith.

^**Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Series H Preferred Shares**. The affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the holders of not less than a majority of the Series H Preferred Shares then outstanding **and** each holder owning more than twenty percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of the then outstanding Series H Preferred Shares shall be required for (a) any change to this Certificate of Designations or the Company’s Articles of Incorporation which would amend, alter, change or repeal any of the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the Series H Preferred Shares, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, and (b) the issuance of Series H Preferred Shares other than pursuant to a Subscription Agreement.

^**Lost or Stolen Certificates**. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Preferred Stock Certificates representing the Series H Preferred Shares, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnification undertaking by the holder to the Company in customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the Preferred Stock Certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new preferred stock certificate (s) of like tenor and date; provided, however, the Company shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates if the holder contemporaneously requests the Company to convert such Series H Preferred Shares into Common Stock.

^**Remedies Characterizations**. The remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief). No remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy. Nothing herein shall limit a holder’s right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designations. The Company covenants to each holder of Series H Preferred Shares that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the holder thereof and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.

^**Construction**. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and all holders of Series H Preferred Shares and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof.

^**Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver**. No failure or delay on the part of a holder of Series H Preferred Shares in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.

^**Notice**. Whenever notice is required to be given under this Certificate of Designations, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with the applicable Subscription Agreement (provided that if the Series H Preferred Shares are not held by a Subscriber (as defined in the applicable Subscription Agreement) then substituting the words “holder of Securities” for the word “Subscriber”).

^**Transfer of Series H Preferred Shares**. A holder of Series H Preferred Shares may assign some or all of the Series H Preferred Shares only in accordance with the terms of the applicable Subscription Agreement.

^**Series H Preferred Shares Register**. The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the holders of the Series H Preferred Shares), a register for the Series H Preferred Shares, in which the Company shall record the name and address of the persons in whose name the Series H Preferred Shares have been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee. The Company may treat the person in whose name any Series H Preferred Share is registered on the register as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, but in all events recognizing any properly made transfers.
