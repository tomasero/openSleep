Mr. [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]] 

c/o [[Organization 1 Name]] 

[[Address 1: Address]] 

Dear John: 

As you are aware, in connection with your employment with [[Organization 2 Name]] (together with its successors and assigns, “PTS”) and [[Organization 1 Name]] (together with its successors and assigns, “Catalent”) you entered into an employment agreement, dated as of [[Date 2: Date]], as amended from time to time (the “Employment Agreement”), which sets forth the terms and conditions of such employment, including the opportunity to earn an Annual Bonus (as defined in the Employment Agreement) in respect of each full fiscal year during the Employment Term (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and the obligation to purchase shares of common stock of PTS (“PTS Shares”). Section 12(d) of the Employment Agreement provides that the Employment Agreement may not be altered, modified or amended except by written instrument signed by you, PTS and Catalent. 

In connection with the obligation under Sections 4(a) and 5(d) of the Employment Agreement to purchase PTS Shares, and in lieu of receiving any Annual Bonus in respect of any fiscal year during the Employment Term commencing with the 2011 fiscal year (any such fiscal year, a “Bonus Year”) solely in the form of cash as is currently provided for pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement, PTS and Catalent have agreed to afford you the opportunity to elect, on an annual basis, prior to the commencement of each applicable Bonus Year (an “RSU Bonus Election”), to receive (I) in respect of the 2011 fiscal year only, (x) fifty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of any Annual Bonus in respect of the applicable Bonus Year in the form of cash and (y) the remaining fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of any Annual Bonus in respect of the applicable Bonus Year (the “ 2011 RSU Value”) in the form of a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) in the form of the award agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Award Agreement”) and (II) in respect of any fiscal year during the Employment Term commencing with the 2012 fiscal year, (x) up to eighty percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of any Annual Bonus in respect of the applicable Bonus Year in the form of cash and (y) the remaining portion of any Annual Bonus in respect of the applicable Bonus Year (the “Post-2011 RSU Value”) in the form of a grant of RSUs in the form of the Award Agreement. Any RSUs which you receive pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, will be granted in accordance with the 2007 [[Organization 2 Name]] Stock Incentive Plan, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time (the “Plan”) and will be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement, the Plan, the Securityholders Agreement dated as of [[Date 3: Date]] among PTS and the other parties thereto, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, and the Management Equity Subscription Agreement dated as of [[Date 4: Date]] between PTS and you, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time (the “Subscription Agreement”) (and for this purpose the PTS Shares received upon settlement of the RSUs shall be deemed to be “Shares” and not “RSU Shares” (as each term is defined in the Subscription Agreement) under the Subscription Agreement). PTS represents that there will be sufficient PTS Shares under the Plan to satisfy your election hereunder. 

In the event you make an RSU Bonus Election with respect to any Annual Bonus in respect of any Bonus Year, the 2011 RSU Value and the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, if any, will be deemed to satisfy your obligations under (x) Section 4(a) of the Employment Agreement to purchase an additional 150 PTS Shares at a purchase price of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] per share and (y) Section 5(d) of the Employment Agreement to invest fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the after-tax proceeds of any Annual Bonus in respect of the 2011 fiscal year in PTS Shares at a purchase price of $[[USD Value 2]] per share and, in each case, the 2011 RSU Value and the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, if any, will count on a dollar for dollar basis against your obligation to invest a maximum of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (such amount, the “Cap”) in PTS Shares; provided that if for a Bonus Year an election results in the 2011 RSU Value or the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, if any, exceeding the Cap, the amount of the Cap shall be increased such that you will be entitled to receive the RSUs representing such 2011 RSU Value or the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, if any. 

To make the RSU Bonus Election, you must execute the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and return it to the General Counsel of Catalent in no event later than the last day of the fiscal year immediately preceding the applicable Bonus Year (the date such election is actually made, the “Election Date”). If you file such election form in a timely fashion, then on the date the Annual Bonus, if any, is paid, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement for which you have made such an election (such date, the “Bonus Payment Date”), PTS agrees to grant you, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, a number of RSUs with a value equal to the 2011 RSU Value or the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, as applicable, based upon the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of a PTS Share on the Bonus Payment Date, in all cases, subject to the terms of the Award Agreement. 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Change of Control (as defined in the Award Agreement) occurs after the Election Date but prior to the Bonus Payment Date, in lieu of receiving the RSUs under the Award Agreement on the Bonus Payment Date, you may elect, in writing, prior to the consummation of such Change in Control, instead to (x) receive a grant of RSUs (the “Successor RSUs”) from the successor entity in such Change of Control transaction (the “Successor”) with a value equal to the 2011 RSU Value or the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, as applicable, based upon the fair market value of a share of Successor common stock (such fair market value to be determined in the same manner as under the Plan), which RSUs will be settleable in shares of Successor common stock and will be subject to terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those contained in the Award Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the same “Settlement Date” (as defined in the Award Agreement) with the “Date of Grant” in such definition being deemed to be the Bonus Payment Date) or (y) have Catalent establish a deferred compensation account (the “Deferred Comp Account”) for you with terms and conditions that are similar, to the extent applicable, to Section 3.7 and Articles 6 and 8 (other than Sections 8.2 and 8.10) of the [[Organization 1 Name]] Deferred Compensation Plan, as such sections or articles, as applicable, may be amended from time to time (the “DCP”), with a distribution date, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is the same as the Settlement Date, with the Bonus Payment Date as the “Date of Grant” for purposes of such definition), which account has an initial value in an amount equal to the 2011 RSU Value or the applicable Post-2011 RSU Value, as applicable, is fully vested as of the Bonus Payment Date and is treated as Deferred Compensation Credits (as defined in the DCP). The terms of any such 

Successor RSUs or Deferred Comp Account shall be determined in good faith and as mutually agreed upon by you and Catalent and/or the Successor, as applicable. To the extent you make an election as provided for in this paragraph, such election shall be deemed to be an amendment of the relevant election form, in accordance with its terms. 

To the extent applicable, this Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and will be interpreted accordingly. 

This letter agreement (including its Exhibits), upon execution by the parties, hereby serves as an amendment to the Employment Agreement. 

Except as expressly set forth above, the Employment Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

This letter agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regards to conflicts of laws principles thereof and any dispute hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with Section 12(c) of the Employment Agreement. 

This letter agreement may be executed by fax or pdf and in any number of counterparts, all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same instrument.

^**Amendment**.

^**Compliance with Section 409A**. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and will be interpreted accordingly.

The Company shall consult with the Participant in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 18; provided that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Participant with respect to thereto. 

^**Dispute Resolution**. Any controversy, dispute or claim relating to this Agreement shall be settled in accordance with Section 12(c) of the Employment Agreement. 

^**No Mitigation/No Offset**. The Company’s obligation hereunder shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim or recoupment. 

^**Signature in Counterparts**. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
