THIS CLAIMS SERVICE AGREEMENT, effective as of [[Date 1]] (“Service Agreement”), is made and entered into by and between [[Organization 2 Name]], a Massachusetts insurance company with offices at [[Address 1: Address]], on behalf of itself and its affiliates when operating as the National Markets strategic business unit (“Liberty Mutual”) and [[Organization 1 Name]] a New Hampshire insurance company with offices at 62 Maple Avenue, [[Address 2: Address]] on behalf of itself and its affiliates and subsidiaries operating as the companies of [[Organization 3 Name]] (“Agency Markets”). 

\centered WITNESSETH 

WHEREAS, National Markets is a business unit within the [[Organization 4 Name]], a group of insurers and associated companies engaged in the transaction of insurance and other related enterprises (“[[Organization 4 Name]]”); and 

WHEREAS, Agency Markets is also a member of the [[Organization 4 Name]] engaged in the transaction of property and casualty insurance business in the United States; and 

WHEREAS, the parties believe it is mutually beneficial to have Liberty Mutual provide certain claims adjusting and related services for and on behalf of Agency Markets. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings hereinafter set forth, the parties do agree as follows: 

^APPOINTMENT;

REGULATORY APPROVALS 

^*Appointment.* Agency Markets hereby appoints Liberty Mutual as a non-exclusive contractor to provide Agency Markets with the Services (as defined herein), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Liberty Mutual hereby accepts such appointment, on such terms and subject to such conditions. 

^*Regulatory Approvals.* It shall be a condition to the effectiveness of this Service Agreement that Agency Markets shall have obtained approval of this Service Agreement from those state insurance departments or other regulatory authorities, the approval of which is required for the effectiveness of this Service Agreement. 

^SERVICES PROVIDED BY LIBERTY MUTUAL 

At the direction of the management of Agency Markets, Liberty Mutual shall provide services requested by Agency Markets and agreed to by Liberty Mutual (the “Services”), including without limitation: 

^^^^^ 
[[Organization 5 Name]]:* including (i) receipt, processing, settlement and payment of claims in states other than Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington under the policies and contracts of workers compensation insurance issued by Agency Markets pursuant to requests from Agency Markets (the “Portfolio”); (ii) acknowledgement of the receipt of notices received from policyholders in connection with any claims; (iii) investigation of any claim, as necessary, to determine its validity and compensability, including verification of coverage and status information and utilization of any relevant documents and/or information made available to Liberty Mutual and advice to the appropriate person of the results of such investigation; (iv) notification to policyholders of declined claims and the reasons for such declinations; (v) response to any inquiry, complaint or request received from any policyholder, agent, broker, regulator or other interested party pertaining to or regarding any such claim, and recordation of such complaints in complaint logs to be maintained by Liberty Mutual on Agency Markets’ behalf; (vi) compliance with claims file maintenance, record retention and reconciliation requirements in conformity with the standards for performance set forth in this Service Agreement or as otherwise agreed by the parties; (vii) engagement and direction, as necessary, of attorneys, consultants or other professionals in connection with the processing, defense and handling or any such claims; (viii) defense of disputed claims; (ix) delivery of notices and other communications to policyholders; and (x) generally, all such other acts and things as are reasonably necessary or otherwise required in the administration of all such claims relating to the Portfolio; 

^^*Additional Services; Curtailed Services.* If Agency Markets requires from Liberty Mutual additional services that are not otherwise contemplated under this Service Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable arrangement under which such additional services shall be provided by Liberty Mutual. Such arrangements shall provide for Agency Markets to provide reasonable compensation to Liberty Mutual for such additional services. If Agency Markets curtails its requirement that Liberty Mutual provide certain of the Services that are contemplated under this Service Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable arrangement under which such curtailed services shall no longer be provided by Liberty Mutual. Such arrangement shall provide for Agency Markets to no longer provide compensation to Liberty Mutual for such curtailed services. 

^PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES  
Liberty Mutual shall utilize its employees or employees of its affiliates within the Agency Markets to perform the Services; provided, however, that Liberty Mutual may retain such legal, financial, actuarial and other advisors and service providers, as Liberty Mutual reasonably deems necessary in its reasonable discretion to perform the Services in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Service Agreement.

Agency Markets, insurance regulatory authorities and their respective designated representatives shall have the right to inspect the Books and Records upon reasonable notice during Liberty Mutual’s normal business hours. 

^*Property of Agency Markets; Return After Termination; Inspection Rights.* Liberty Mutual acknowledges and agrees that the Books and Records are and shall remain the property of Agency Markets. Liberty Mutual shall promptly return the Books and Records to Agency Markets upon the termination of this Service Agreement in accordance with Article 9.4; provided, however, that in the event that a dispute arises between Agency Markets and Liberty Mutual, Liberty Mutual shall have the right at any time after the termination of this Service Agreement and with reasonable prior notice to inspect the Books and Records returned to Agency Markets insofar as the Books and Records relate to such dispute, and to make copies thereof or extracts therefrom; and provided, further, that nothing in this Article V shall supersede, preclude or otherwise limit any discovery rights otherwise available to Liberty Mutual or Agency Markets. 

^THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGENCY MARKETS AND LIBERTY MUTUAL 

Liberty Mutual and Agency Markets agree that: 

^^Agency Markets and Liberty Mutual are not partners or joint venturers with each other, and nothing herein shall be construed so as to make them partners or joint venturers with each other, or to impose any liability as such on either of them. Liberty Mutual shall perform its duties hereunder as an independent contractor and not as an employee or agent of Agency Markets. Except as expressly granted in this Service Agreement or otherwise by the other party in writing, or as may be required by law, or as is necessary to perform the Services to be provided hereunder, no party shall have any authority, express or implied, to act on behalf of the other party or its subsidiaries. 

^^Liberty Mutual shall hold any amounts collected by it with respect to the Portfolio for the benefit of Agency Markets. Funds held in such account shall be remitted to Agency Markets, or 

^^^^^ 
transferred to a Agency Markets account, as directed by Agency Markets. 

^^Each party agrees to notify the other party within a reasonable time upon receipt of any written or oral communication from any state insurance department or any other government or regulatory department or agency of such department’s or agency’s intention to proceed with any administrative action, such as a hearing, fine, license suspension or revocation or similar action, against Agency Markets or Liberty Mutual, which administrative action relates in any way to Agency Markets’ or Liberty Mutual’s performance under this Service Agreement or which otherwise relates to the Portfolio. 

^^In the event that Agency Markets or Liberty Mutual or both are made parties to, or threatened with, any legal or regulatory proceeding arising out of or in connection with the Services or the Portfolio, it is agreed that they will promptly notify and cooperate fully with each other to defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve such legal or regulatory proceeding consistent with the intent of this Service Agreement. 

^^Liberty Mutual shall reasonably cooperate with Agency Markets in connection with the provision of the Services under this Service Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Service Agreement to the contrary, Agency Markets shall retain the ultimate authority to make all decisions with respect to the Services. 

^SERVICE FEES AND EXPENSES  
^*Fees and Expenses.* Charges, fees and expenses to be charged by Liberty Mutual and paid by Agency Markets hereunder for services rendered on the Portfolio until [[Date 2: Date]] are set forth in “Fee Schedule  2010” attached. Thereafter successive Fee Schedules will be negotiated and agreed by the parties and attached hereto. Fees for losses or loss adjustment expense are not included in this Agreement and will be billed directly to the file. 

^*Cost Recovery By Liberty Mutual.* Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Liberty Mutual shall be entitled to receive from Agency Markets, the amount of Liberty Mutual’s full actual cost of providing the Services hereunder, and therefore, if the fees charged do not equal Liberty Mutual’s full actual cost of providing the Services during the term hereof, then Agency Markets shall pay Liberty Mutual the amount of such deficiency as an additional fee hereunder. 

^*Accounts and Disbursements.* Amounts owing between the parties shall be settled on a monthly basis and payment of amounts owing shall be made within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter. 

^DISPUTE RESOLUTION & INDEMNIFICATION 

^*Dispute Resolution.*  

^^^^^ 
^^Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof (each, a “Dispute”) shall be resolved as set forth in this Article VIII. 

^^Within ten (10) days or as soon as reasonably practicable after any party’s receipt of a notice of Dispute from the other party setting forth in detail and together with supporting documentation, if any, the nature and basis of the Dispute (the “Dispute Notice”), to the general counsel and the chief financial officer of Liberty Mutual and the general counsel and the chief financial officer of Agency Markets shall meet in person at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute. 

^^If either the chief financial officer of Liberty Mutual or Agency Markets declares an impasse then within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, the respective chief executive officers of Liberty Mutual or Agency Markets shall meet in person at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute. 

^^If either the chief executive officer of Liberty Mutual or Agency Markets declares an impasse no earlier than sixty (60) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice (or such shorter period, if the parties so agree in writing), then, at the instruction of either party’s chief executive officer, the Dispute shall be referred to, and finally settled by, confidential and binding arbitration in accordance with the then-prevailing JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures as modified as follows (the “Rules”): 

^^^There shall be three (3) neutral arbitrators of whom each party shall select one. The claimant shall select its arbitrator in its demand for arbitration and the respondent shall select its arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receipt of the demand for arbitration. The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall select a third arbitrator to serve as chairperson within fourteen (14) days of the designation of the second of the two (2) arbitrators. If any arbitrator is not timely appointed, at the request of any party such arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS pursuant to the listing, striking and ranking procedure in the Rules. 

^^^Each arbitrator appointed by a party shall be either an attorney with substantial experience with the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industry and at least ten (10) years admission to the bar, or a property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industry professional of at least ten (10) years standing. The chair of the arbitral tribunal shall either be a practicing attorney with no less than ten (10) years of practice and experience as an arbitrator, with, if possible, experience relating to insurance or reinsurance disputes, or be a retired judge. 

^^^^^ 
^^^The place of arbitration shall be Boston, Massachusetts, unless some other place is mutually selected by the parties. The arbitral tribunal shall be required to follow the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding the matter presented to the arbitral tribunal, including any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to the tribunal. Judgment upon the decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal is empowered to award any remedy provided for under applicable law and the terms of this Agreement, including injunction, specific performance or other forms of equitable relief. The arbitral tribunal is not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages. Each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover punitive, exemplary or similar damages with respect to any Dispute. 

^^^Any arbitration proceedings, decision or award rendered hereunder and the validity, effect and interpretation of this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1 et seq. 

^^Each party shall bear its own costs in any negotiations pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 9(c) and any arbitration, provided that the parties shall share the fees and expenses of the arbitrators equally as well as any JAMS fees and expenses. 

^^All negotiations conducted pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 9(c) shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations and may not be introduced as evidence of an admission against interest of either party. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, either party may seek the provisional judicial remedy of a preliminary injunction or specific performance, if in its reasonable judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of such court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the arbitral tribunal’s orders to that effect. 

^^The parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts located in Boston, Massachusetts, for the purpose of seeking any provisional remedies as contemplated by Section 9(g). In any such action, suit or proceeding, each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that the party is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, that such action or suit is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 

^^^^^ 
each of the parties irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any such action, suit or other proceeding. 

^*Indemnification by Liberty Mutual.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Service Agreement, Liberty Mutual shall indemnify Agency Markets and its directors, officers, employees and agents against all claims, losses and reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of any action or inaction taken or omitted to be taken by Liberty Mutual or its agents, employees or subcontractors in connection with its obligations under this Service Agreement; provided, however, under no circumstances shall Liberty Mutual be liable or responsible for costs, fees or expenses associated with Portfolio claims. 

^*Indemnification by Agency Markets.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Service Agreement, Agency Markets shall indemnify Liberty Mutual and its directors, officers, employees and agents against all claims, losses and reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of any action or inaction taken or omitted to be taken by Agency Markets or its agents, employees or subcontractors in connection with its obligations under this Service Agreement. 

^*Indemnification Procedure.* Any payment to be made under this Article VIII shall be made within twenty (20) Business Days (as defined herein) of the delivery of notice of an uncontested claim for indemnification or, in the case of a contested claim, within twenty (20) Business Days of final determination of the amount for which indemnification will be made hereunder. Any amount not paid within such twenty (20) Business Day period shall bear simple interest at the 30-Day C.P. Rate from the twentieth (20th) day until the date of payment. As used in this Service Agreement, the term “Business Day” shall mean any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which the principal place of business of Liberty Mutual is closed or a day on which banking institutions in the City of Boston are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
