The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Note and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the Holders of the Note against impairment.

The Holder may exercise such right by delivery to the Borrower of a written notice of conversion not less than three (3) business days prior to the date upon which such conversion shall occur.

^^**Holder’s Note Conversion Privilege**. Subject to applicable Federal and/or State securities laws, at any time after [[Date 13: Date]], the Holder may convert all of part of the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest into shares of the Company’s common stock, (“Common Stock”) at any time prior to full payment of this Note. The Holder shall provide notice in writing to the Company from the registered holder hereof. Upon delivery of notice of conversion, the principal amount so converted shall cease to bear interest, beginning with the date of such notice, this Note shall be deemed paid to the extent of the amount so converted with any remaining outstanding balance of principal, interest and fees due as provided herein. For purposes hereof, the price at which shares of Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of this Convertible Promissory Note without the payment of any additional consideration by the Holder thereof (the "**Conversion Price**") shall be [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the average closing bid price for the Common Stock of [[Organization 1 Name]] on the Principal Trading Market for the twenty (20) trading days ending the day prior to the Notice of Conversion.

4.1.1 The “Principal Trading Market” for the Common Stock shall include the OTC Bulletin Board or commonly known as the Pink Sheets (the electronic quotation system operated by **Pink OTC Markets, Inc.**) (whichever of the foregoing is at the time the principal trading market or electronic quotation system for the Common Stock, or any securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being listed or traded.

^^**Conversion Limitation.** Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be entitled to convert pursuant to the terms of the Note an amount that would be convertible into that number of shares of Common Stock which, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise beneficially owned by such Holder including those issuable upon exercise of warrants held by such Holder would exceed [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Borrower at the time of conversion. For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder. The conversion limitation described in this Section 4 shall automatically become null and void upon sixty-one (61) days prior notice to the Maker by the Holder

^^**Mechanics of Holder’s Conversion**. (a) In the event that the Holder elects to convert this Note into Common Stock, the Holder shall give notice of such election by delivering an executed and completed notice of conversion (“**Notice of Conversion**”) to the Maker and such Notice of Conversion shall provide a breakdown in reasonable detail of the Principal Amount, accrued interest and fees being converted. On each Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined) and in accordance with its Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall make the appropriate reduction to the Principal Amount, accrued interest and fees as entered in its records and shall provide written notice thereof to the Maker within two (2) business days after the Conversion Date. Each date on which a Notice of Conversion is delivered or telecopied to the Maker in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be deemed a Conversion Date (the “**Conversion Date**”). A form of Notice of Conversion to be employed by the Holder is annexed hereto as Exhibit A.

4.3.1 Pursuant to the terms of the Notice of Conversion, the Maker will issue instructions to the transfer agent accompanied by an opinion of Holder’s counsel (that such issuance will not violate applicable Federal and/or State Securities Laws) within three (3) business day of the date of the delivery to Maker of the Notice of Conversion and shall cause the transfer agent to transmit the certificates representing the Conversion Shares to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s designated broker with [[Organization 7 Name]] (“**DTC**”) through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (“**DWAC**”) system within three (3) business days after receipt by the Maker of the Notice of Conversion (the “**Delivery Date**”). In the case of the exercise of the conversion rights set forth herein the conversion privilege shall be deemed to have been exercised and the Conversion Shares issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have been issued upon the date of receipt by the Maker of the Notice of Conversion. The Holder shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Common Stock, unless the Holder provides the Maker written instructions to the contrary.

^^**Conversion Mechanics**.  
4.4.1 The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing that portion of the principal and interest and fees to be converted, if any, by the then applicable Conversion Price. In the event of any conversions of outstanding principal amount under this Note in part pursuant to this section 4, such conversions shall be deemed to constitute conversions of outstanding principal amount applying to Monthly Amounts for the remaining Repayment Dates in chronological order.

4.4.2 The Conversion Price and number and kind of shares or other securities to be issued upon conversion is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as follows:

^**Stock Splits, Combinations and Dividends.** If the shares of Common Stock are subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares of Common Stock, or if a dividend is paid on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, if any portion of the Conversion Price is calculated based upon bid closing prices occurring prior to such event, the Conversion Price or the Conversion Price, as the case may be, shall be proportionately reduced in case of subdivision of shares or stock dividend or proportionately increased in the case of combination of shares, in each such case by the ratio which the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event with respect to the closing bid prices used in the calculation of the Conversion Price occurring prior to such event.

^**Reserving Shares.** During the period the conversion right exists, the Maker will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Maker represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Maker agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers, agents, and transfer agents who are charged with the duty of executing and issuing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of this Note.

^**Reclassification, etc.** If the Maker at any time shall, by reclassification or otherwise, change the Common Stock into the same or a different number of securities of any class or classes, this Note, as to the unpaid Principal Amount and accrued interest thereon, shall thereafter be deemed to evidence the right to purchase an adjusted number of such securities and kind of securities as would have been issuable as the result of such change with respect to the Common Stock immediately prior to such reclassification or other change.

^^**Issuance of New Note**. Upon any partial conversion of this Note, a new Note containing the same date and provisions of this Note shall, at the request of the Holder, be issued by the Maker to the Holder for the principal balance of this Note and interest which shall not have been converted or paid. Subject to the provisions of Section 4, the Holder will pay no costs, fees or any other consideration to the Maker for the production and issuance of a new Note.

^^**Lawful Money**. All payments will be in lawful money of the United States of America or in such other form which is acceptable to Holder. Holder’s acceptance of payment in any form other than lawful money of the United States of America for any partial payment required or permitted under the provisions of this Note will not be a waiver of the requirement that any future payments be made in lawful money of the United States of America.

^**Prepayment**. Maker will have the right to prepay the Note in full or in part, at any time, subject to the terms of the Note without penalty, provided Maker shall give Holder at least ten days written notice of such prepayment to allow time for Holder to exercise its rights of conversion under Section 4 of this Note..

^**Default**. If Maker fails to timely make any payment or other amount due under this Note or otherwise takes any action or fails to take any action that constitutes a default under this Note, Holder shall send a Notice of Default to Maker, informing Maker of the nature of the default. Upon delivery of the Notice of Default, Maker shall have ten (10) days to cure the default and provide a Notice of Cure to Holder, explaining that the default has been cured.

^**Remedies**. Upon the occurrence of a default that is not cured within the ten-day period described above, Holder may, in its sole discretion:

^^Declare the entire unpaid principal and all other sums owed hereunder immediately due and payable;

^^Irrespective of whether the unpaid principal is accelerated under section 7.1 above, upon the occurrence of a default that is not cured within the ten-day period described above the interest rate shall be automatically increased to [[Percentage 4: Number]]% per annum on the full outstanding balance from the date any delinquent payment was due until the delinquency is cured; and

^^Exercise any remedy set forth herein or otherwise available at law or in equity.

^**Remedies Cumulative**. No remedy herein conferred upon Holder is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every such remedy will be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently and will be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

^**Waiver**. Failure or delay of Holder to exercise any right or remedy hereunder with respect to any default or other circumstance will not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the same with respect to any subsequent default or other circumstance or in the event of continuance of any existing default after demand for performance hereof.

^**Choice of Law**. This Note will be governed by, and will be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Arizona, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any controversy arising out of, connected to, or relating to any matters herein of the transactions between Holder and Borrower shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules for Commercial Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association and in accordance with this paragraph and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof in accordance with the provisions of Arizona Law.

The decision of a majority of the board of arbitrators, who shall render their decision within thirty (30) days of appointment of the final arbitrator, shall be binding upon the parties.

Venue for any proceeding herein shall lie in Phoenix, Arizona. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. In the event that any provision of this Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision of this Note.

\centered **STATEMENT OF RIGHTS OF WARRANT HOLDER**

^^This Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part at anytime or from time to time on or after [[Date 19: Date]], but not later than 5:00 p.m., Post Falls, Idaho Time on [[Date 14]], by presentation and surrender hereof to the Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the Purchase Form annexed hereto duly executed and accompanied by payment of the applicable Exercise Price (whether by a certified check or bank draft payable at par to the order of the Company) for the number of shares of Common Stock as specified in such Form, together with all federal and state taxes applicable upon such exercise. The Company agrees to provide notice to the Holder that any tender offer is being made for the Securities no later than the first business day after the day the Company becomes aware that any tender offer is being made for the Securities. If this Warrant should be exercised in part only, the Company shall, upon surrender of this Warrant for cancellation, execute and deliver a new Warrant evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder along with any additional Redeemable Warrants not exercised. Upon receipt by the Company of this Warrant at the office of the Company or at the office of the Company's stock transfer agent, in proper form for exercise and accompanied by the total Exercise Price, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Securities issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing such Securities shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder.

^^In the event, prior to the expiration of this Warrant by exercise or by its terms, the Company shall issue any shares of its Common Stock as a stock dividend or shall subdivide the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock into a greater number of shares, then, in either of such events, the then applicable Exercise Price per share of the shares of Common Stock purchasable pursuant to this Warrant in effect at the time of such action shall be reduced proportionately and the number of shares of the Common Stock at that time purchasable pursuant to this Warrant shall be increased proportionately; and, conversely, in the event that the Company shall reduce the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock by combining such shares into a smaller number of shares, then, in such event, the then applicable Exercise Price per share of the shares of Common Stock purchasable pursuant to this Warrant in effect at the time of such action shall be increased proportionately and the number of shares of Common Stock at that time purchasable pursuant to this Warrant proportionately shall be decreased. Any dividend paid or distributed upon the Common Stock in shares of any other class of the Company or security convertible into shares of the Common Stock shall be treated as a dividend paid in shares of the Common Stock to the extent that shares of the Common Stock are issuable upon the conversion thereof.

^^In the event, prior to the expiration of this Warrant by its exercise or by its terms, the Company shall be recapitalized by reclassifying its outstanding Common Stock into shares with a different par value, or by changing its outstanding Common Stock to shares without par value, or in the event the Company or a successor corporation shall consolidate or merge with or convey all or substantially all of its or of any successor corporation's property and assets to any other corporation or corporations, or in the event of any other material change of the capital structure of the Company or of any successor corporation by reason of any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise, then as a condition of any such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger or conveyance, a prompt, proportionate, equitable lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the Holder of the Warrant shall thereafter have the right to purchase, upon the basis and the terms and conditions specified in this Warrant, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock theretofore purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock theretofore purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant had such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, merger or conveyance not taken place; and in any such event, the rights of the Holder of this Warrant to any adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant, as hereinbefore provided, shall continue and be preserved in respect of any stock, securities or assets which the Holder becomes entitled to purchase.

^^In the event the Company, at any time while this Warrant shall remain unexpired and unexercised, shall sell all or substantially all of its property, or dissolves, liquidates, or winds up its affairs, prompt, proportionate, equitable, lawful and adequate provision shall be made as part of the terms of any such sale, dissolution, liquidation, or wind up, such that the Holder of this Warrant may thereafter receive, upon exercise hereof, in lieu of each share of Common Stock of the Company which he would have been entitled to receive, the same kind and amount of any stock, securities or assets as may be issuable, distributable or payable upon any such sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, with respect to each share of the common stock of the Company. Provided, however, that in the event of any such sale, distribution, liquidation, or winding up, the right to exercise this Warrant shall terminate on a date not later 5:00 p.m., Post Falls, Idaho Time, March 15, 2015 (the Expiration Date).

^^(e) The exercise price of the Warrant shall be subject to adjustment on a full ratchet basis to prevent dilution in the event the Company issues additional shares at a purchase price less than the then current exercise price of the Warrant.

^^Upon any exercise of this Warrant by the Holder, the Company shall not be required to deliver fractions of one share of the Common Stock; but prompt, proportionate, equitable, lawful and adequate adjustment in the Exercise Price payable by the Holder shall be made in respect of any such fraction of one share of the Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant.

^^^**Conversion Limitation.** Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of this Warrant an amount that would be exercisable into that number of shares of Common Stock which, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise beneficially owned by such Holder including those issuable upon exercise of warrants or conversion of promissory notes held by such Holder would exceed [[Percentage 3]]% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company at the time of exercise. For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder. The exercise limitation described in this Section shall automatically become null and void upon sixty-one (61) days prior notice to the Company by the Holder.

^^In the event, prior to the expiration of this Warrant, the Company shall determine to take a record of its stockholders for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to receive any stock dividend, distribution or other right which will cause any change or adjustment in the number, amount, price or nature of the Common Stock or other stock, securities or assets deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Company shall give to the registered Holder of this Warrant at its address as it appears on the books of the Company at least 15 days' prior written notice to the effect that it intends to take such a record. Such notice shall specify the date as of which such record is to be taken; the purpose for which such record is to be taken; and the number, amount, price and nature of the Common Stock or other stock, securities or assets which will be deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant after the action for which such record will be taken has been consummated.

^^The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant at any time as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

^^This Warrant shall not entitle the Holder to any of the rights of stockholders or to any dividend declared upon the Common Stock unless the Holder shall have exercised this Warrant and purchased the shares of the Common Stock prior to the record date fixed by the Board of Directors of the Company for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to such dividend right.

^^**Transfer To Comply With The Securities Act Of 1933.**

^This Warrant or the Common Stock or any other security issued or issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, unless registered, may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of except to a person who, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, is a person to whom this Warrant or such Warrant Stock may legally be transferred without registration and without the delivery of a current prospectus under the Securities Act with respect thereto and then only against receipt of any agreement of such person to comply with the provisions of federal and/or state securities laws with respect to any resale or other disposition of such securities.
