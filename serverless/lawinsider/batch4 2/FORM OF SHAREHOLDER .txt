WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into the Merger Agreement and as an inducement and in consideration therefor, Shareholder has agreed to enter into this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

^Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

^^Shareholder (i) is the record and beneficial owner of the shares of Company Common Stock (together with any shares of Company Common Stock which such Shareholder may acquire at any time in the future during the term of this Agreement, the “Shares”) set forth opposite Shareholder’s name on Schedule I to this Agreement and (ii) except as set forth in Schedule I to this Agreement, neither holds nor has any beneficial ownership interest in any other shares of Company Common Stock or any performance based stock units, restricted stock, deferred stock units, options (including any granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan), or warrants to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or other right or security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock. 

^^Shareholder has the legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

^^This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by Shareholder and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against such Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and (ii) that the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. 

^^Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in a violation of, or a default under, or conflict with, any contract, trust, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder or Shareholder’s assets are bound. The consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) violate any provision of any Order applicable to Shareholder or (ii) to the knowledge of the Shareholder after reasonable investigation, require any consent, approval, or notice under any statute, law, rule or regulation applicable to Shareholder other than (x) as required under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) where the failure to obtain such consents or approvals or to make such notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the performance by Shareholder of any of its obligations under this Agreement. 

^^The Shares and the certificates, if any, representing the Shares owned by Shareholder are now, and at all times during the term hereof will be, held by Shareholder, by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of Shareholder or by the depository under the Offer, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, options, rights (other than community property interests), understandings or arrangements or any other encumbrances or restrictions whatsoever on title, transfer, or exercise of any rights of a shareholder in respect of such Shares (collectively, “Encumbrances”), except for (i) any such Encumbrances arising hereunder, (ii) any rights, agreements, understandings or arrangements which represent solely a financial interest in cash received upon sale of the Shares and (iii) Encumbrances imposed by federal or state securities laws (collectively, “Permitted Encumbrances”). 

^^The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Shareholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

^^No broker, investment bank, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial adviser’s or similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Shareholder. 

^Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represents and warrants to Shareholder as follows:

^^This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (ii) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. 

^^Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub nor the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in a violation of, or a default under, any contract, trust, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which either Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which either Parent or Merger Sub or their respective assets are bound. The consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) violate any provision of any judgment, order or decree applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) require any consent, approval, order, authorization or permit of, or declaration, registration, filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (w) applicable requirements, if any, of (A) the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, the filing with the SEC of the Schedule TO, (B) state securities or “blue sky” Laws, (C) the Georgia Business Corporation Code (“GBCC”) to file the Articles of Merger or other appropriate documentation and (D) Nasdaq, (x) those required by the HSR Act, (y) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or obtained under any foreign antitrust, competition or similar Laws in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (z) the filing of customary applications and notices, as applicable with any Regulatory Authority.

^^The Shareholder agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of his Affiliates not to, become a member of a “group” (as that term is used in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act) with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Stock Awards or any other voting securities of the Company for the purpose of opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, provided, however, this Section 4(c) shall not apply if (i) the Offer shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or (ii) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 9.
