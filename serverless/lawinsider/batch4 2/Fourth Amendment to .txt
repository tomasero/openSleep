^‘Disqualified Person’ shall mean any person if: 

^The aggregate number of Deemed-Owned Shares of such person and the person’s Members of the Family is at least twenty percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the number of Deemed-Owned Shares of stock in the S Corporation; or

In the case of a Disqualified Person described in paragraph (A) immediately above, any person’s Member of the Family shall be treated as a Disqualified Person if not otherwise treated as a Disqualified Person under paragraphs (A) or (B) immediately above.

^‘Members of the Family’ shall mean, with respect to any individual: 

^The spouse of the individual;
^An ancestor or lineal descendant of the individual or the individual’s spouse;

^^^^^ 
^‘Impermissible Accrual’ shall mean any holding of Common Stock of an S Corporation by the ESOP Component, and assets attributable thereto, for the benefit of a Disqualified Person during a Nonallocation Year. For purposes of this subsection (b)(7), assets attributable to S Corporation Common Stock owned by the ESOP Component include any distributions, within the meaning of Section 1368 of the Code, made on S Corporation Common Stock held in the ESOP Accounts of a Disqualified Person (including earnings thereon) such that, in the event of a Nonallocation Year, all Common Stock of the S Corporation and other assets of the ESOP Component attributable to such S Corporation Common Stock, including distributions and sales proceeds (and earnings thereon), held in the ESOP Accounts of such Disqualified Person for such year constitute an Impermissible Accrual for the benefit of the Disqualified Person, whether attributable to contributions in the current year or in prior years. 

^‘Impermissible Allocation’ shall mean (i) any contribution or other annual addition (within the meaning of Section 415(c)(2) of the Code) made to the account of a Disqualified Person, or (ii) any other accrual of additional benefits, directly or indirectly, under the Plan or any other qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code (including any release and allocation from a Loan Suspense Account, as described in Treas. Reg. §54.4975-11(c) and (d)) that, for the Nonallocation Year, would have been added to the ESOP Accounts of such Disqualified Person and invested in S Corporation Common Stock owned by the ESOP Component, but for a Plan provision precluding such addition to the ESOP Accounts of a Disqualified Person and investment in S Corporation Common Stock during a Nonallocation Year.

^‘Synthetic Equity Shares’ shall mean any stock options, warrants, restricted stocks, deferred insurance stock rights, or similar interests or rights that give the holder the right to acquire or receive Common Stock of an S Corporation in the future. Except to the extent provided in the Treasury regulations, Synthetic Equity Shares shall also include: 

^any rights to future payments (payable in cash or any other form other than stock of the S Corporation) (e.g., stock appreciation rights, phantom stock units, or similar rights to future cash payments) based on the value of such stock or appreciation in such value;
^any rights to acquire stock or other similar interests in a related entity if such interests in the related entity are the only significant asset of the S Corporation and the S Corporation is the only significant owner of the related entity (e.g., partnership, trust, or Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiary under Section 1361(b)(3)of the Code);
^any remuneration for services rendered to the S Corporation, or a related entity, to which Section 404(a)(5) of the Code applies (including remuneration for which a deduction would be permitted under Section 404(a)(5) of the Code if separate accounts were maintained);
^any rights to receive property (to which Section 83 of the Code applies) in a future year for the performance of services to an S Corporation, or a related entity;
^any transfers of property (to which Section 83 of the Code applies) in connection with the performance of services to an S Corporation, or a related entity, to the extent that the property is not substantially vested within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.83-3(i) by the end of the Plan Year in which transferred; and
^any remuneration for services rendered to an S Corporation, or a related entity, under a plan, or method or arrangement, deferring the receipt of compensation to a date that is after the 15th day of the 3rd calendar month after the end of the entity’s taxable year in which the related services are rendered, other than a plan that is an eligible retirement plan within the meaning of Section 402(c)(7)(B) of the Code.

^^^^^ 
Notwithstanding the above, Synthetic Equity Shares do not include shares that are deemed-owned ESOP shares. In the case of a person who owns Synthetic Equity Shares of an S Corporation, except to the extent provided in regulations, the shares of stock in the S Corporation on which such Synthetic Equity Shares are based shall be treated as outstanding stock in such corporation and Deemed-Owned Shares of such person if such treatment of Synthetic Equity Shares of one or more persons results in (i) the treatment of any person as an S Corporation Disqualified Person; or (ii) the treatment of any Plan Year as a Nonallocation Year. 

For purposes of this definition, Synthetic Equity Shares shall be treated as owned by a person in the same manner as stock is treated as owned by a person under the rules of paragraphs (2) and (3) of Section 318(a) of the Code. If, without regard to this definition, a person is treated as a Disqualified Person or a Plan Year is treated as a Nonallocation Year, this definition shall not be construed to result in the person or year not being so treated. 

^^Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, during any Plan Year in which the Company is an S Corporation and Company Stock held under the ESOP Component consists of stock in an S Corporation, any portion of the assets held by the Trust, either attributable to or allocable in lieu of such Company Stock, accruing or being allocated (either directly or indirectly) under this Plan or any plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code that is maintained by the Company for the benefit of a Disqualified Person shall constitute a Prohibited Allocation and shall be null and void *ab initio*. 

^^Any part of a Restricted Participant’s accrued benefit that is held by the ESOP Component may be converted into cash: 

^During any Plan Year following the close of the Plan Year in which the Restricted Participant incurs a termination of employment with the Company for any reason, provided at such time the Trust has an adequate amount of cash to convert (in whole or part) the Restricted Participant’s ESOP Account; or 

^During any Plan Year in which an allocation to a Disqualified Person could result in a Nonallocation Year, prior to such allocation and solely to the extent required to prevent a Nonallocation Year from occurring. 

The value of the Restricted Participant’s Account may be determined as of the end of the Plan Year in which the Restricted Participant incurs a Termination Date, as of the end of the Plan Year immediately preceding the potential Nonallocation Year, or as of the more recent valuation, if any. However, except in the case of reemployment, none of a Restricted Participant’s accrued benefit will be credited with any further Company contributions, forfeitures, dividends on Company Stock or gain on the sale of Company Stock held in a Loan Suspense Account. 

^^^^^ 
^^This Section 5.12 is intended to satisfy the provisions under Section 409(p) of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated and in effect thereunder. To the extent that any provision of this Section 5.12 is inconsistent with Section 409(p) of the Code or the related Treasury regulations, such provision shall be operated in accordance with the Code and Treasury regulations, not with this Plan document.” 

^Effective as of [[Date 1]], a new sentence is hereby added between the third and fourth sentences of subsection 9.2(c) to read as follows:

“In the event that the nonforfeitable portion of a Participant’s Account is less than the maximum amount prescribed in Section 411(a)(11) of the Code, any distribution thereof that is greater than $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and is made without the Participant’s written consent before attaining the later of Normal Retirement Age or age 62, shall be paid in a direct rollover to an individual retirement account designated by the Trustee to the extent the Participant does not otherwise elect to receive such distribution directly or have it paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover.” 

^The second and third sentences of subsection 9.14(d) are hereby amended in their entirety to read as follows:

“Alternatively, Common Stock may be distributed subject to the requirement that it be resold to the Company (or to the Trust) under payment terms that comply with Section 9.15. If Company Stock is distributed from the Trust to a Participant who directs that such Company Stock be distributed to his individual retirement arrangement in a direct rollover, the Company’s S corporation status shall not be affected, provided that, upon the distribution of the Company Stock to the Participant’s individual retirement arrangement, the Company repurchases the Company Stock contemporaneously with, and on the same day as, such distribution.” 

^The last sentence of subsection 9.15(a)(1) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

“The right of first refusal shall provide that, prior to any subsequent transfer, the Common Stock must first be offered for purchase in writing to the Company, and then to the Trust, for a price and under such other terms no less favorable to the seller than the greater of the value of the Common Stock determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. §54.4975-11(d)(5), or the purchase price and other terms offered by a buyer, other than the Company or the Trust, making a good faith offer to purchase such Common Stock.” 

^Subsection 9.15(a)(2) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

“The Company and the Trust shall have a total of fourteen (14) days to exercise the right of first refusal under the terms provided in subsection (a)(1).” 

^^^^^ 
^A new subsection 9.15(b)(6) is hereby added to read as follows:

“Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, in no event shall the Company be obligated to acquire Common Stock from a Participant or Beneficiary at an indefinite time subject to the occurrence of an event, as provided under Treas. Reg. §54.4975-11(a)(7)(i).” 

^The last sentence of Section 12.5(a) is hereby amended, effective as of [[Date 1]], by deleting the following phrase therefrom:

“separation from service”  
and substituting the following phrase therefore: 

“severance from employment”
