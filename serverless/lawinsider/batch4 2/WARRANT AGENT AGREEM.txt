Each Warrant Certificate shall be dated as of the Closing Date.

^^**Execution.**  
One Officer shall sign each Warrant Certificate for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a Warrant Certificate no longer holds that office at the time the Warrant Agent countersigns the Warrant Certificate, the Warrant Certificate shall be valid nevertheless. A Warrant shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Warrant Agent countersigns, by manual or facsimile signature, the Warrant Certificate. The signature shall be solely for the purpose of authenticating the Warrant Certificate and shall be

conclusive evidence that the Warrant so countersigned has been duly authenticated and issued under this Warrant Agent Agreement. The Warrant Agent may appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to countersign the Warrants, including, without limitation, the Company.

Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an agent may countersign Warrants whenever the Warrant Agent may do so. Each reference in this Warrant Agent Agreement to countersigning by the Warrant Agent includes countersigning by such countersigning agent. An agent has the same rights as any Warrant Registrar or agent for service of notices and demands.

^^**Warrant Registrar.**  
^^The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Warrants may be presented for registration of transfer, exchange or exercise (the “**Warrant Registrar**”). The Warrant Registrar shall keep a register of the Warrants and of their transfer, exchange or exercise. The Company may have one or more co-registrars. The term Warrant Registrar includes any co-registrars. The Company appoints the Warrant Agent as Warrant Registrar in connection with the Warrants.

^^The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Warrant Registrar who is not a party to this Warrant Agent Agreement. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Warrant Agent Agreement that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Warrant Agent of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Warrant Registrar, the Warrant Agent shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation pursuant to Section 3.5 hereof. The Company or any of its domestically organized wholly owned subsidiaries may act as Warrant Registrar.

^^The Company may remove any Warrant Registrar upon written notice to such Warrant Registrar and to the Warrant Agent; **provided, however**, that no such removal shall become effective until (i) acceptance of an appointment by a successor as evidenced by an appropriate agreement entered into by the Company and such successor Warrant Registrar and delivered to the Warrant Agent or (ii) notification to the Warrant Agent that the Warrant Agent shall serve as Warrant Registrar until the appointment of a successor in accordance with clause (i) above. The Warrant Registrar may resign at any time upon written notice to the Company and the Warrant Agent; **provided**, however, that the Warrant Agent may resign as Warrant Registrar only if the Warrant Agent also resigns as Warrant Agent in accordance with Section 3.6.

^^Until a Warrant Certificate is transferred in the Registry, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Warrant Certificate is registered in the Registry as the absolute owner of such Warrant Certificate for all purposes whatsoever and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

^^**Holder Lists.**  
The Warrant Agent shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of the Holders. If the Warrant Agent is not the Warrant Registrar, the Company shall furnish, or cause the Warrant Registrar to furnish, to the Warrant Agent, in writing at such times as the Warrant Agent may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Warrant Agent may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders.

^^**Obligations with Respect to Transfers and Exchanges of Warrants****.**

^^^To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, by either manual or facsimile signature, Warrant Certificates at the Warrant Registrar’s request.

^^^No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessments, or governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes, assessments, or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges to be registered in the name of the registered Holder effecting the exchange). The Warrant Agent shall have no duty or obligation under any Section of this Warrant Agent Agreement requiring the payment of taxes, assessments, and/or governmental charges unless and until it is satisfied that all such taxes, assessments, and/or governmental charges have been paid.

^^^All Warrant Certificates issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Warrant Agent Agreement shall evidence the same terms and shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Warrant Agent Agreement as the Warrant Certificates surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

^^The Warrant Agent shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Warrant Agent Agreement or under

applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Warrant other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of this Warrant Agent Agreement, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

^^**Lost, Stolen, Destroyed, Defaced or Mutilated Warrant Certificate.**

If a mutilated Warrant Certificate is surrendered to the Warrant Agent or if the Holder of a Warrant claims that the Warrant Certificate has been lost, destroyed, stolen or defaced, the Company shall issue and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, by either manual or facsimile signature, a replacement Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of Warrants, if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met, such that the Holder (a) notifies the Company or the Warrant Agent within a reasonable time after such Holder has notice of such loss, destruction or theft and the Warrant Registrar does not register a transfer prior to receiving such notification, (b) makes such request to the Company or the Warrant Agent prior to the Warrant being acquired by a protected purchase r as defined in Section 8-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code (a “protected purchaser”) and (c) satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Warrant Agent. If required by the Warrant Agent or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Warrant Agent to protect the Company and the Warrant Agent from any loss that either of them may suffer if a Warrant is replaced. The Warrant Agent may charge the Company for their expenses in replacing a Warrant Certificate. Every replacement Warrant Certificate is an additional obligation of the Company. The provisions of this Section 2.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement of mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Warrants.

^^**Outstanding Warrants.**  
Warrants outstanding at any time are all Warrant Certificates executed by the Company and countersigned by the Warrant Agent except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.6 as not outstanding. A Warrant does not cease to be outstanding because an Affiliate of the Company holds the Warrant. A Warrant ceases to be outstanding if the Company holds the Warrant. If a Warrant Certificate is replaced pursuant to Section 2.5, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Warrant Agent and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Warrant Certificate is held by a protected purchaser.

^^Temporary Warrants.  
Until Warrant Certificates are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, by either manual or facsimile signature, temporary Warrant Certificates (the “**Temporary Warrant Certificates**”). Temporary Warrant Certificates shall be substantially in the form of Warrant Certificates but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Warrants. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall

prepare and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, by either manual or facsimile signature, Warrant Certificates and deliver them in exchange for Temporary Warrant Certificates upon surrender of such Temporary Warrant Certificates at the office or agency of the Company, without charge to the Holder.

^^**Cancellation.**  
The Company at any time may deliver Warrant Certificates to the Warrant Agent for cancellation. The Warrant Agent and no one else shall cancel all Warrant Certificates surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, replacement, exercise or cancellation and shall dispose of canceled Warrant Certificates in accordance with its customary procedures or deliver canceled Warrant Certificates to the Company pursuant to written direction by an Officer. The Company may not issue new Warrant Certificates to replace Warrant Certificates that have been exercised or Warrants which the Company has purchased or otherwise acquired. The Warrant Agent shall not countersign Warrant Certificates to replace canceled Warrant Certificates other than pursuant to the terms of this Warrant Agent Agreement.

^^**CUSIP Numbers.**  
The Company may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use) in issuing the Warrants and, if so, the Warrant Agent shall also use “CUSIP” numbers in notices to Holders; **provided, however**, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Warrant Certificates or as contained in any notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Warrant Certificates, and any such notice shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

^^**Exercise Terms.** Each Warrant may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the applicable Warrant Certificates. The Warrant Agent may rely exclusively on any Exercise Notice (as defined in the Warrant Certificate) delivered to the Warrant Agent by the Company to determine that a Warrant has been duly exercised by a holder thereof.
