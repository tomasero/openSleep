^The Intended Use of the Premises  
The Premises will be erected by [[Organization 1 Name]] with a view to the industrial purposes of Skechers, i.e. a distribution and added value logistics center and any supporting or related activities. The Warehouse may be used solely and exclusively as a space for the storage, transshipment, reparation, transportation, handling and distribution of goods. If an operating or environmental permit or notification is required for the activities of Skechers, Skechers shall be responsible, at its sole risk and expense, for the request and obtainment thereof, as well as for any renewal or extension during the term of this Agreement. Skechers shall bear all costs relating thereto and shall strictly adhere to all conditions imposed by such permit or notification. 

In the conduct of its activities, Skechers shall at all times comply with all applicable legislation and regulations. Skechers shall fully indemnify and hold harmless [[Organization 1 Name]] for any losses and damages suffered by [[Organization 1 Name]] as a result of a breach by Skechers of any law, regulation or permit condition.

The Office Space may be used solely and exclusively for administrative and/or showroom activities, with the exception of any activity as a result of which the Agreement would fall within the scope of the Law of [[Date 1: Date]]. The car parking spaces may be used solely and exclusively for the parking of the cars of Skechers and its contacts. 

All other activities and/or adjustments in the Premises may only take place subject to prior written permission by [[Organization 1 Name]], which will not withhold its permission without any justified reasons. 

[[Organization 1 Name]] undertakes to furnish the Premises in such a manner and Skechers undertakes to use the Premises in such a manner that each payment under the current Agreement will at any time be subject to VAT (Belgian VAT) within the meaning of Article 44, §3 2º (a), second point, of the VAT Code. 

In the event that, due to a use of the Premises during the term of this Agreement which is not in conformity with the terms of this Agreement, the payments under the current Agreement are no longer subject to VAT, either in part or in their entirety, Skechers will compensate [[Organization 1 Name]] for any loss suffered by the latter as a result, including the loss which [[Organization 1 Name]] may suffer by being unable to recoup the VAT already paid by it. 

Skechers is not authorized to alter this use without prior written permission by [[Organization 1 Name]], which will not withhold its permission without any justified reasons. 

It is explicitly agreed that any use of the Premises or the Site for any work or activity covered by the legislation regarding commercial leases (The Law dated [[Date 1]] as amended) is strictly prohibited. 

Skechers may not use the Premises as residential accommodation nor may it keep any living animals there. 

Skechers may not carry out any activities in the Premises, nor install any objects or equipment which would subject the floor to excessive loads or exert an extreme pressure on the structure of the Premises. 

Within this context, it must be stated that the maximum floor load permitted in the Warehouse is 5,000 kg per m of the floor area, on the Mezzanine floor in the Warehouse 400 kg per m of the floor area and in the Office Space 400 kg per m of the floor area. 

Skechers is not entitled, for whatever reason, to conduct public sales in the Premises. 

Skechers is obliged to obtain all required permits from the competent authorities at its own cost and risk enabling a proper operation in the Premises. 

^Price and Deposit  
The Agreement for the availability of the Premises is entered into on the basis of an annual price (price level [[Date 2: Date]]) of nine hundred ninety-one thousand nine hundred and seventy-one Euro and fifty-five Eurocent, i.e. 991,971.55, (+VAT : two hundred and eight thousand three hundred and fourteen Euro and three Eurocent i.e.  208,314,03, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Price’, payable per quarter and in advance in four (4) equal parts of two hundred and forty-seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-two Euro eighty-nine Eurocent, i.e.  247,992.89, (+VAT : fity-two thousand and seventy-eight Euro fity-one Eurocent i.e.  52,078.51), to be made by direct bank transfer to the bank account of [[Organization 1 Name]]. 

As stipulated in Article 5, this Agreement is to take effect on [[Date 3: Date]]. The first period over which payment is due will therefore be the period from [[Date 3]] up to and including [[Date 4: Date]], which is due as from [[Date 3]]. 

In the event that the Premises are completed after [[Date 3]] the provisions relating to the payment of the Price as stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be suspended until the effective date of completion. 

The Price must be paid in Euro and is payable to [[Organization 1 Name]] sprl, account number: 720540646989 ([[Organization 2 Name]]). 

If Skechers, either in part or in its entirety, is in default with the payment of the above-mentioned quarterly payments of the Price on the aforementioned dates when the payments are due, Skechers must pay [[Organization 1 Name]], by operation of law (“*ipso iure*”) and without notice of default, the interest due over that sum amounting to twelve percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) per annum, whereby any month that has commenced must be regarded as completed. 

When the Price in accordance with Article 4 is modified, the amount of the bank guarantee, as referred to in Article 25, will have to be adjusted in line with the annual adjustment of the Price payments every year. This bank guarantee may only be released six (6) months after the termination of the Agreement, provided that Skechers have been released properly of the obligations resulting from this Agreement. Under no circumstance, shall the bank guarantee be used by Skechers to pay the Price. However, in the event of breach of Agreement on the part of Skechers, [[Organization 1 Name]] may use the aforementioned deposit to compensate for Skechers’ overdue payments and any other omissions in the performance of its obligations by Skechers. 

^^^^^ 
^Price Modifications  
Unless otherwise provided by law, it is determined that the Price, as stipulated in Article 3, will be linked to the consumer price index (“health index)” as published each month in the Belgian State Gazette. 

The basic index is that of the month prior to the signature of this Agreement, *i.e.* the month [[Date 5: Date]]. 

The Price will be reviewed annually on the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, automatically and by operation of law, in accordance with the increase of the aforementioned index according to the formula as defined below, whereby the month used for the new index will be the month prior to the relevant anniversary of the date of the entry into force: 

\centered 

new Price =    Price x new index  basic index  

However, the new Price will at no time be lower than the Price as stipulated above. 

Skechers will implement the modifications to the Price subject to a one-month notification to that effect by [[Organization 1 Name]]. 

In the event that the publication of the ‘consumer price index’ (health index) should be discontinued, the parties will agree to replace this by the new index published by the Belgian government. 

In the event that no new official index is published, the parties, if they fail to come to an agreement, will submit the problem to a tribunal of three arbitrators. Each party will appoint its own arbitrator within one month of being requested to do so by the other party and the two arbitrators will jointly appoint a third arbitrator. 

If one of the parties fails to duly appoint its arbitrator or if the two arbitrators fail to appoint a third arbitrator, the missing arbitrator will be appointed, at the request of either party, by the Justice of the Peace in whose jurisdiction the Premises are located. 

It is explicitly agreed that [[Organization 1 Name]] shall only waiver the right to increase the Price arising from this article by a written confirmation, signed by [[Organization 1 Name]].

^Introduction  
^^Background  Purpose of the Report  
GEDAS, member of the ARCADIS-group, was commissioned by [[Organization 1 Name]] on behalf of [[Organization 1 Name]] Belgium II S.p.r.1. (“[[Organization 1 Name]]”) on [[Date 21: Date]] to perform **an update** of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA) of a Site in [[Address 12: Address]] the Avenue du Parc Industriel, 4041 Herstal-Milmort ([[Address 5: Address]], Belgium (“the Site”). 

The contract is based on the ARCADIS proposal 2002.M5662 from [[Date 22: Date]]. 

Representative photographs of the site / site inspection findings are attached in appendix 1; an overview map is shown in appendix 2.1. 

Although no soil investigation is included in a Phase I Site Assessment, based on the ASTM practice, an investigation has been conducted in [[Date 23: Date]] and is added in appendix 3 (3.2.). 

^^Scope of Work/Methodology  
ARCADIS GEDAS already performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the site located near the Avenue du Parc Industriel, 4041 Herstal-Milmort in October-[[Date 24: Date]]. This assessment did not identify any non-compliances with the environmental legislation. No further investigation was required by the environmental authorities. 

This above described assessment was updated. The update was carried out to define the present environmental condition of the site and to identify potential sources of environmental liabilities. 

The main objectives for this update are to acquire an understanding of any changes in the current situation compared with 2000 and liabilities with regard to: 

actual and previous use/site history;

soil and groundwater;

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 5/44  

^^^^^ 
general environmental setting;

surrounding land use and potential impacts on the site;

legal requirements, permits;

The Phase I ESA is based upon the following activities: 

Record review: review of available information related to the former and present uses of the location and adjacent properties.

Site reconnaissance: a visit to the property to investigate the Site and surrounding properties.

Interviews with current owners and with the government

Preparation of a written Phase I Environmental Site Assessment report, with a summary of GEDAS’s conclusions and recommendations.

^^Planned Land Use of the Site  
In 2000 the investigated site (app. 15.5 ha) was free of any construction and was used as arable ground (mainly for cereals). 

In 2001 the land was divided in 2 pieces (Lot I and Lot II) with each a surface of app. 8 ha. On one of these parcels (Lot I) a building (Lot I, Phase I) has been constructed. [[Organization 1 Name]] plans to rent out this new constructed building. Therefore the investigation (Phase I ESA and limited soil investigation), only considers this part of the parcel with the building on. 

Extensions to the buildings are foreseen in the near future. A second part of this building will be constructed in the future years (Lot I, Phase II) *(cf.* appendix 2). 

The existing buildings and planned buildings are shown in appendix 2.3. The logistics hall and the office were at the time of site inspection not put into use(22/08/2002).

^^^^^ 
^^Limitations of Investigation/Disclaimer 

The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was performed by GEDAS in conformance with the scope and limitations of the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) standard practice for Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (E 1527-00) and the Master Services Agreement for consulting with [[Organization 1 Name]], [[Organization 1 Name]], [[Organization 1 Name]] B.V. or any of its European affiliates and subsidiaries, agreed and accepted on 4 [[Date 25: Date]]. 

The Phase I ESA comprised a site visit on [[Date 26: Date]]. The site inspection was conducted by Mr. [[Person 5 First Name]] [[Person 5 Last Name]] and Mr. [[Person 6 First Name]] [[Person 6 Last Name]]. The desk study was performed by Ms. [[Person 7 First Name]] [[Person 7 Last Name]]. The desk study comprised a limited review of existing documentation as well as confirmation of regulatory compliance from provided/presented permits or revision protocols and the interpretation of information on the environmental setting of the area in wich the site is located. 

The results, findings, conclusions, and recommendations provided in this Phase I Environmental Site Assessment report are based on the conditions that were observed during the Site inspection, the review of past occupancy history of the location and information asked for by several authorities provided.

**2.1.2 Current Property Use / Site Operations** 

The Site is classified as an industrial area allowing non-polluting industrial activities. Zone 3 of the industrial parc in which the Site is located, allows only transportation and transport-related activities since this zone is specified as “parc industriel pour les logistics”. The entire surface of this Industrial Zone 3 is app. 121 ha. 

The land studied in 2000 covered approximately 15,5 ha. The whole Site was at the time (2000) owned by S.P.I. (Services Promotion Initiatives en Prov. de [[Address 17: Address]], 14 in 4000 [[Address 5: Address]]. 

This site was in 2001 divided in 2 parts (Lot I and Lot II) of each app. 8 ha. [[Organization 1 Name]] bought one of both sites in [[Date 27: Date]] (Lot I). The other part is still property of S.P.I. Lot I was divided in two pieces : Lot I, Phase I and Lot I, Phase II. Each Phase covers approximately 4 ha. **Only Phase I is included in this investigation.** 

The Site of interest (Lot I, Phase I) covers approximately 4 ha. A building of app. 22.450 m had been constructed. No electrical towers and overhead power lines are located on the site. Along the southern property border three electrical towers are present. 

The cadastral data from Lot I are known as : 

community of [[Organization 7 Name]] 6, Section A, cadastral parcel 620 a (27.529 m)

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 10/44  

^^^^^ 
The current site operation (empty building) is not qualified as of any environmental concern according to the results of the site visit, data review and according to verbal statements of the authorities. Specific operation permits beyond the general construction are not required at this time. 

**2.1.2.1 Electricity, Transformers**  
The plant’s electric system is connected to the public supply net (Idea, in the past Electrabel). No PCB containing transformers or capacitors are in use on site as far as noticed during the site visit. This was confirmed by [[Organization 1 Name]]. 

The site operates 1 transformer in the transformer-station located near the sprinkler installation (see map in appendix 2.2); the power output is 630 kVA. 

**2.1.2.2 Water Management**  
Water Supply  
The potable water supply of the Site is partly provided by the S.W.D.E. (Société Wallone des eaux) and the C.I.L.E. ([[Organization 8 Name]] des eaux). This water concerns sanitary and drinking water. A sprinkler basin (capacity 550 m) is present on the site (southwestern area of the location). 

Sewer System / Waste Water  
The site’s sanitary waste water and storm water is collected separately in the site’s sewer system and conveyed to the new public sewage system. The internal sewer consists of PVC-pipes. 

The site does not operate a water / oil separator (not required); production waste water generating processes are not carried out at this time. Sanitary water is headed via a degreaser towards the sewer system. 

**2.1.2.3 Heating Units**  
The site operates a natural gas fueled heating system consisting of: 

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 11/44  

^^^^^ 
^^heating circuit with a boiler unit (Ø 160) in the administration building (Firm [[Organization 9 Name]]) Two heating rooms are present. The equipment in the offices consist of Radson radiators.

^modern heating radiators type Reznor in the logistic halls.

The radiators in the logistic halls should periodically be supervised by a certified chimney sweep company. 

The location of the boiler unit in the administration building is shown in Appendix 2.6. 

**2.1.2.4 Heating Oil**  
The site does not operate a heating oil fueled system. 

**2.1.2.5 Natural Gas**  
There is a natural gas pipeline (Association Liégois de gaz (A.L.G.) and Distrigas) and a sewage draining system. Electrical power is provided by A.L.E. (Association Liégois d’léctricité). 

**2.1.2.6 Underground Storage Tanks (USTs)** 

At the site, no underground storage tanks are noticed. No visit was executed inside the building, only the exterior part. 

**2.1.2.7 Aboveground Storage Tanks (ASTs)** 

At the site, besides the water tank (550 m), no aboveground storage tanks are noticed. No visit was executed inside the building, only the exterior part 

**2.1.2.8 Fuel Station**  
No fuel station or battery loading stations are noticed on site. 

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 12/44  

^^^^^ 
**2.1.2.9 Storage of Chemicals**  
Nowadays the activities of the site do not (yet) comprise the use, storage and/or handling of hazardous materials and materials of environmental concern. 

According to the owner of the site, no spills or accidents occured till date during the building of the hall. 

**2.1.2.10 Emissions to the Atmosphere**  
In the future due to the gas heating / boiler exhausts, emissions will be generated on the site. At this time no air emissions are present on site. 

**2.1.2.11 Noise, Vibration and Odor Nuisance** 

Up till now the site does not operate heavy noise generating machinery leading to external noise emissions above the permitted emission values for industrial areas nor generating relevant vibrations. 

No complaints occurred during the building of the warehouse. 

The truck traffic to and from the [[Organization 1 Name]]- site will not pass designated residential areas. Since the site entrance as well as the loading / unloading areas and internal traffic zones are not neighbored by housing areas, truck traffic generated noise emissions are unlikely to be a nuisance in the future. 

Odor emitting processes do not occur at the site. 

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 13/44  

^^^^^ 
**2.1.2.12 Waste Materials**  
The site (empty building) produces no hazardous commercial waste (packaging material, cardboard, plastic foil etc.) or normal office waste. 

**2.1.2.13 Potentially Contaminated Building Materials** 

Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM)  
ACM has not been identified during the inspection of the recently constructed building and is not present according to the owner and the reviewed construction documents (i.e. installation of ACM in new buildings is forbidden according to the applicable Belgian legislation). 

**PCB**  
The site does not operate PCB-containing transformers according to the owner; PCB-containing earth cables have not been installed. 

**2.1.2.14 Radioactive Materials**  
[[Organization 1 Name]] has not been using or storing radioactive materials. Ionization-smoke-detectors containing radioactive substances are not used on the site. 

**2.1.2.15 Other Contaminated Building Material** 

During the site visit, no contamination of building materials has been observed (new building). 

**2.1.2.16 Health & Safety**  
Dangers to the public could not be detected at this time. The site is not in possession of an emergency plan at this time. No plan is required at this time.

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 14/44  

^^^^^ 
**2.1.2.17 Fire Protection**  
The municipal fire prevention revised the application for the building permit (prior to the start of the construction of the building) and imposed some rules concering fire protection. 

According to the reviewed permit the following rules should be followed : 

Implantation : A connecting road should be present for the intervention vehicles (fire department, ambulance ,...) This road should be 4 m long and should be located at a distance of 2 m from the building. This has been fulfilled.

Structure : Rf-value (fire resistance) / h, electricity should be controlled by a recognized expert, the safety exits should be clearly marked, pictograms must be applied, an alarm should be installed

Fire protection : The site must be equipped with sufficient hose reels. The whole building must be reached with one jet of water. A proposal with the implantation of the fire extinguishers for the whole building complex must be transferred. Two Fire extinguishers based on water must be installed on each officelevel. Four CO fire extinguishers must be installed on specific sites on the location. The installation of automatic fire / smoke detectors and a sprinkler system is required. An aboveground hydrant should exists (possible to supply 60 m/hour, during 2 hours).

Should future storage and handling of large volumes of combustible/flammable materials or an expansion of the halls result in an increase of fire risk, than an upgrading of the present fire prevention / fire fighting installations would be required. 

**2.1.3 Previous Property Use**  
The site was used for agricultural purposes until 2000-2001. Mainly cereals and maize were grown on the land. An aerial photograph ordered by the firm Eursosense showed that in 1985 no activity was present on the site.

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 14/44  

^^^^^ 
**2.1.4 Summary of Property History**  
Besides the above mentioned previous use, the site development till date comprises the construction of the present logistic hall and related administration- / service building in 2001-2002. On the 15th of September, new tenants will enter this buildings. 

^^Environmental Setting  
**2.2.1 Geology**  
The geology of the location can be schematised in the following way: 

The site of investigation is situated in the wide valley of the Meuse. Immediately below surface, Quaternary river deposits occur. These can consist of gravel (Pleistocene Meuse terraces) and a mixture of sand, silt and clay (Holocene Meuse deposits). 

Below these recent layers, the Paleozoic basis occurs. At the location the top is formed by deposits of Westphalian and Namurian (late Carboniferous) age. These consist of sandstone and schist, alternated with coal beds. Underneath, the Visean and Tournesian limestones occur. The underlying Devonian beds consist of alternating thick limestone and sandstone layers. The basis of the Paleozoic layers is formed by metamorphous schist and kwartsite of Silurian and Cambrian age. 

Potential aquifers in the region are formed by the Meuse gravel deposits, and the Paleozoic limestones in which secondary porosity was created by karstic phenomena. 

**2.2.2 Hydrogeology**  
According to Mr. [[Person 10 First Name]] [[Person 10 Last Name]] (2000) it is not possible to abstract groundwater at this location. This is due to the presence of sandstone, schists, limestone and coal beds in the subsoil. The groundwater level of the first aquifer should only be situated at 118 m-gl in the Houiller. However in this formation some sandstone layers can be present with a thickness of 20-30 m. It is impossible to abstract water from the sandstone layers. 

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 16/44  

^^^^^ 
We asked once more for the groundwater abstraction within a radius of 2 and 5 km. Four active abstractions (undrinkable) are present within a distance of 2 km. Two non-active groundwater abstraction wells are present within a distance of 2 km. One potentially polluating activity is present within a distance of 2 km : Axima S.A.. The data are presented in appendix 3 (3.3.). 

**2.2.3 Hydrology**  
Rainwater is collected on the site and conveyed into the public sewage system (separation rainwater  discharged waste water). The only surface water bodies of importance for the Site are the river called the “Meuse (de Maas)” and the Albert canal, both located approximately 6 km to the east of the Site. The direction of the groundwaterflow can not be determined based on present data. 

The Site is located in an area with problems with respect to rainwater. The soil in this area is very impermeable, which makes it very hard for rainwater to infiltrate in the soil. This was obvious during the site visit as the soil was very swampy after a downpour. A big pond was visible on the southeastern site. 

**2.2.4 Topography**  
The topography of the Site slopes from the southeast to the northwest. On the site of Weerts a pile of soil was visible. No information concerning the origin of the ground was given. Probably the soil is originating from Weerts. 

**2.2.5 Previous Investigations**  
In the past GEDAS carried out an environmental and geotechnical investigation in the current investigation area and on the neighbouring site. 

According to the reviewed files provided for the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, GEDAS produced the following reports for the site and the neighbouring site:

Together with the geotechnical study on the neighbouring parcels, 8 soil samples were taken and were analysed to determine the soil quality. No concentrations exceeded the Walloon Background Values or the Flemish Vlarebo Intervention Values. 

^new soil investigation was executed on the current site. 

**2.2.6 Environmental Sensitivity**  
No wooded areas were observed on or around the property by GEDAS at the time of the Site inspection. The Site was formerly covered with cereals. No stressed vegetation was noticed. The site is not located in a biological valuable area. This was once more asked to the institution of nature conservation. 

Regarding the presence of archeologic relicts, an inquirement was made once more with the authorities. 

According to the S.P.I. no relicts were ever found on surrounding properties. 

The “Service des fouilles de la région Wallonne” has mentioned in 2000 the possible presence of a Roman track from Tongeren to Herstal (Chaussée Brunehaut on the map). This implies that every demand for a building permit should be advised by the “Service de Archéologie, Direction de [[Address 18: Address]]. They should attend every meeting concerning the preparation of the works and the start up of the activities. If something important is found they can stop the works. 

There were contacts with this autorities during the construction works. A copy of this correspondence is represented in Appendix 3.7. 

To the west behind the E313 the municipality of Liers is situated. To the east at 1,5 km the municipality of Milmort is located.

**2.2.7 Planning Applications**  
The district plan defines the site and its surrounding as an industrial area. A copy of this Plan is attached in appendix 3.4. Additional legal obligations were asked for by the competent autorithies. 

Building permission for the constructed building : 

The building permission was granted on [[Date 32: Date]]. The building permission for the Phase I distribution center is attached in Appendix 3.5. 

**2.2.8 Current Surrounding Uses**  
The Site is bordered to the west by the “Avenue du parc industriel” and the E313 Highway and to the other sides by small to medium sized enterprises. 

The closest neighbours are Weerts (to the south) and Techspace Aero (to the east). These companies are medium-sized enterprises. Weerts is specialised in transport of biscuits. Techspace Aero produces aircraft engines. On the other sides the site is bordered by agricultural land, property of I.S.P.C. and Air Liquide. 

According to the authorities no specific environmental problems were noticed except for some complaints concerning noise in the past. These were complaints from the local inhabitants concerning traffic. These complaints were not addressed to the activities of [[Organization 1 Name]].

Based on the review available documentation and the site visit, the current use of the surrounding properties does not seem to represent any risk for potential contamination of the Site. 

All companies in the surrounding area are in possession of required operational permits and no issues of non-complianced have been reported. No changes with regard to the situation in 2001 was reported. Only Weerts started in 2001 with the storage of foods in refrigerators *(cf.* appendix 3.6.). 

**2.2.9 Previous Surrounding Uses**  
The area was previously used for agricultural purposes. 

**2.2.10 Statement of Property Sensitivity** 

An official central register regarding the sensitivity of a property does not exist in Belgium. The information regarding potential sensitivity issues such as environmental relevance, landfill 

\centered

registration, contaminated land registry, mining issues etc. have to be obtained from several authorities. 

The mentioned sensitivity aspects are described in the previous chapters. 

**2.2.11 Site Access and Traffic**  
The location is served by the E40 and the E313. Public transport facilities are present. The surrounding streets are well-maintained. 

**2.2.12 Utilities**  
*Water*  
The potable water supply of the Site is partly provided by the S.W.D.E. (Société Wallone des eaux) and the C.I.L.E. ([[Organization 8 Name]] des eaux). This water concerns sanitary and drinking water. 

*Gas*  
Natural gas is supplied by Distrigas and A.L.G. (Association Liègois de Gaz) (cf. Paragraph 3). 

*Electricity*  
Electricity is provided by Idea (in the past by Electrabel). 

*Sewer*

^Regulatory / governmental agency inquiries 

This section discusses the Walloon legislation regarding environmental practices. 

The present legislation in Walloon relating to environmental protection is not well developed. Only in specific domains exists a legislation (f.e. waste). 

The authorities are aware of the current situation and have worked out a new legislation. The new decree should replace the old legislation. However one is still waiting for new implementing regulations. Until then the old regulations stay into use. 

According to the local authorities it will probably take another two years before this new legislation will be officially enforced. 

^^Environmental law  
^big part of the environmental law of the Walloon district is still sectorial legislation (surface water, noise, etc.). However since ten years some overall environmental aspects are implemented in the Walloon legislation. 

From this point of view two decrees merit particular attention. 

**3.1.1 Environmental impact assessment**  
In view of the European directive 85/337/EEG concerning environmental impact assessment of some public and private projects, the Walloon authorities have decided on the decree of [[Date 33: Date]]. The decree was implemented in 1991 and has found wide application. 

The decree makes some government decisions (f.e. granting of exploitation permits, building permits) subject to a preceding environmental impact assessment f.e.: 

Whenever a request for an exploitation permit or some building permit is submitted, it has to be joined by a preceding environmental impact assessment *(,,Notice d’évaluation préalable des incidences“).* 

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 22/44  

^^^^^ 
The competent authorities evaluate the repercussions of the project on the environment. If the authorities consider the repercussions to be negligible, no further investigation / measures should be taken. 

If the authorities consider the environmental repercussions of the project to be important, an extensive environmental impact assessment *(,,ètude d ’incidences“)* should be conducted. 

This elaborate assessment *(,,ètude d’incidences“)* contains at least: 

^description of the project, the location, planning and dimensions

The necessary information to identify and to value the effects of the project on the environment

^description of the necessary measures necessary to avoid negative aspects

^non-technical description of the data mentioned above

The elaborate environmental impact assessment should be conducted by a recognised expert. After the study has been finished, the developer submits five copies of the demand to the competent authorities. These authorities forward the demand to the local authorities with a view to a public investigation. 

**3.1.2 Admission to environmental information** 

With a decree of [[Date 34: Date]] (concernant la liberté d’acces des citoyens à l’information relative è l’environnement) the free entrance to environmental information has been converted into law. 

^^Environmental law concerning specific environmental sectors 

Up till now no complete integrated system for environmental permits is implemented. Only in a few domains the legislation is well developed. 

The most important legislations at this moment are : 

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 23/44  

^^^^^ 
**3.2.1 Exploitation of dangerous or unhealthy activities** 

In the Walloon provinces the legislation for exploitation of unhealthy goods is still the R.G.P.T. (Réglement Générale pour la Protection du Travail)  legislation (former federal legislation). The permits are given for a maximal duration of 30 years. 

Activities listed in Chapter II of title I of the R.G.P.T. should get an exploitation permit. The establishments are grouped in two classes, depending on their size and impact on the environment. 

If the activities are defined as second class, the involved municipality (in case Herstal) will judge the demand. If the activities are classified as class one, the involved province (in case Liége) will grant the environmental permit. If necessary an appeal should be lodged with the Walloon minister. 

**3.2.2 Protection of the surface water**  
The protection of the surface water is organized in the decree of 7 [[Date 35: Date]]. A permit is necessary to discharge water (industrial waste water and domestic wastewater). 

**3.2.3 Protection and exploitation of groundwater and drinking water** 

With the decree of 30 [[Date 36: Date]] the protection of the groundwater and the surface water is regulated. For example for the abstraction of groundwater a permit is necessary. 

**3.2.4 Protection of air**  
No separate legislation exists concerning air pollution. The permit for the exploitation of the activities holds standards for the air emissions. Awaiting a new Walloon legislation, the authorities often use the German TA-Luft standards.

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 24/44  

^^^^^ 
**3.2.5 Noise abatement**  
No separate legislation exists concerning noise abatement. A federal law of 1973 still forms the legal framework. As for the air-emissions, the permit for the exploitation of the activities holds standards for noise. 

**3.2.6 Soil protection**  
^soil investigation has been conducted at this site *(cf.* appendix 3.2.). 

In Walloon there is only specific regulation concerning soil, soil protection or soil remediation for service stations. Frequently references are made to the Walloon Waste legislation. 

The Walloon authorities have however realized that there is a need for such a legislation and are working on a legislation concerning this soil protection. 

^^Environmental management system  
In order to manage environmental issues properly in all departments of the company, it is essential that everyone bears clear-cut responsibilities for the environment. In the event of accidents that affect the environment, the responsible authority has to be informed. 

In Belgium, there are no legal requirements for the implementation of an environmental management system, neither in Flanders nor in the Walloon provinces.

^^Sitescope Report  
In Belgium, a property data file comparable to a sitescope report and sitefile directory (see next chapter) is not provided. The land registry comprises the areal extent of a property, the covered land parcels / identification, ownership, registered easements. 

^copy of the actual land registry dated [[Date 37: Date]] is attached as appendix 3.1. 

According to the land registry, the [[Organization 1 Name]] site comprises the following parcels defined in land registry: Municipality of [[Organization 7 Name]], Section A, part of parcel 450 y.

^Environmental Risk Assessment  
GEDAS, a member of the ARCADIS group, has performed an update of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of a Site at the Avenue du Parc industriel at Milmort (Herstal), Belgium in conformance with the scope and limitations of the ASTM standard practice for Phase I Environmental Site Assessments. 

Observations made during the Site reconnaissance did not identify any non-compliance with the environmental legislation. 

^review of historical activities on Site and the current use of the Site do not reveal any environmental conditions and no further investigation is recommended. 

Our Phase I ESA did not reveal any recognised environmental conditions and no indications of possible land contamination were reported nor noted and no further investigation is recommended or required.

\centered **Summary of Issues** 

\centered 

^Environmental Risk Assessment    Finding / Conclusion: 

Based on the findings of the site inspection and data review / desk study, the actual and planned future site utilization and the identified subsurface situation do not inhere any relevant environmental risks 

Recommendation:    No Action required 

^Results of Walk-Over Inspection    Finding / Conclusion: 

During the walk-over inspection, no issues representing a relevant matter of environmental concern or indicating the need for major rehabilitation- or corrective measures have been identified 

Recommendation:    No Action required 

^Planned Building Expansion    Finding / Conclusion: 

On Lot I, Phase I a new storage building had been constructed. On this parcel no building expansion is provided. 

Recommendation:    No Action required 

^Site-/Building Survey Report    Finding / Conclusion: 

Existing documents state that the actual buildings show no deviation of the planned building and the constructed building with regard to location and size. 

Recommendation:    No Action required  

\centered 

Date: 23th [[Date 20]]    Page: 29/44  

^^^^^ 
\centered 

^Chemicals    Finding / Conclusion: 

Site activities at this time do not comprise use/handling of hazardous materials and materials of environmental concern requiring official permission and regulatory surveillance. 

Recommendation:    No Action required 

^Traffic Study    Finding / Conclusion: 

Truck traffic is not present at this time. In the future traffic will not pass through designated areas. Since the site entrance as well as the loading / unloading areas and internal traffic zones are not neighbored by housing areas, truck traffic generated noise amissions are unlikely to be a nuisance in the future. 

Recommendation:    No Action presently 

^Future Fire-Prevention Measures    Finding / Conclusion: 

Should future storage / handling of larger volumes of combustible / flammable materials or an expansion of the halls result in an increase of the fire risk, an upgrading of the present fire prevention / fire fighting installations would be required 

Recommendation: 

Internal assessment of future fire load situation depending on planned storage activities, informal discussion with authorities regarding potential permission requirements.    No Action presently 

^Soil investigation    Finding / Conclusion: 

Based on the soil analysis no further soil and groundwater investigation or remedial actions are required by the authorities. 

Recommendation:    No Action required
