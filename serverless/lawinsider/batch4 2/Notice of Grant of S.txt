To the extent vested, the Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised in part or in full prior to expiration. As soon as practicable following any exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right, you will be entitled to receive the value of the portion of the Stock Appreciation Right exercised. The value of the portion of the Stock Appreciation Right that was exercised will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares underlying the portion of the Stock Appreciation Right that was exercised on the date of such exercise, and (2) the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a share of HDI’s Common Stock on the date of such exercise exceeds **«price».** The Stock Appreciation Right will be valued and paid in cash in your local currency using the spot rate on the date of such exercise, less applicable withholding. 

The Stock Appreciation Right is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of HDI’s 2009 Incentive Stock Plan (the “Plan”) and this Stock Appreciation Right Agreement. Additional provisions regarding your Stock Appreciation Right and definitions of capitalized terms used and not defined in this Stock Appreciation Right Agreement can be found in the Plan. 

If you cease to be employed by the Company and its Affiliates for reasons other than Cause (as defined in the Plan) on or after age fifty-five (55): (a) if such cessation of employment occurred after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, then, effective immediately prior to the time of cessation of employment, any portion of the Stock Appreciation Right that was not previously exercisable will become fully exercisable and (b) without limiting your rights under Section 7(g) of the Plan, the Stock Appreciation Right shall remain exercisable, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of cessation of employment, until the earliest of: the Stock Appreciation Right’s expiration date; the first anniversary of the date of your death; or the third anniversary of the date of such cessation of employment. 

**Exhibit 10.10** 

You may return this Stock Appreciation Right Agreement to the Company (in care of the Vice President and Treasurer of HDI) within thirty (30) days after the Grant Date, and by doing so you will forfeit any rights under this Stock Appreciation Right Agreement. If you choose to retain this Stock Appreciation Right Agreement beyond that date, then you accept the terms of this Stock Appreciation Right and agree and consent to all amendments to the Plan, the [[Organization 1 Name]] 1995 Stock Option Plan and the [[Organization 1 Name]] 2004 Incentive Stock Plan through the Grant Date as they apply to this Stock Appreciation Right and any prior awards to you of any kind under such plans.
