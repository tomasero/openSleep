^^The business, operations and facilities of the Company and each of the Subsidiaries have been and are being conducted in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, licenses, permits, approvals, plans, authorizations or requirements relating to occupational safety and health, or pollution, or protection of health or the environment, or reclamation (including, without limitation, those relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of pollutants, contaminants or hazardous or toxic substances, materials or wastes into ambient air, surface water, groundwater or land, or relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of chemical substances, materials or wastes, whether solid, gaseous or liquid in nature) or otherwise relating to remediating real property of any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality of the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, or any foreign jurisdiction, and all applicable judicial or administrative agency or regulatory decrees, awards, judgments and orders relating thereto, except any violation thereof which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and, except as disclosed in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice from a governmental instrumentality or any third party alleging any violation thereof or liability thereunder (including, without limitation, liability for costs of investigating or remediating sites containing hazardous substances and/or damages to natural resources). 

^^There is no claim pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated under any federal, state, local or foreign law, rule, regulation, decision or order governing pollution or protection or restoration of the environment (the “**Environmental Laws**”) against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; there are no past or present actions or conditions including, without limitation, the use, disposal or release of, or human exposure to, any hazardous or toxic substance or waste regulated under any Environmental Law that are likely to form the basis of any such claim against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary maintain a system of internal environmental management controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of compliance in all material respects of their business facilities, real property and operations with requirements of applicable Environmental Laws. 

^^Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has all necessary permits, licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals and has made all necessary filings required under any federal, state, local or foreign law, regulation or rule, and has obtained all necessary authorizations, consents and approvals from other persons, material to the conduct of its respective business.

^^All legal or governmental proceedings, contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus pursuant to Regulation S-K have been so described as required. 

^^The statements in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the headings (i) “Description of Capital Stock” and (ii) “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” (to the extent such statements relate to matters of U.S. federal income tax laws), fairly summarize the matters therein described. 

^^The Company and the Subsidiaries have good title to all properties and assets owned by them and have good leasehold interest in each property and asset leased by them, in each case free and clear of all pledges, liens, encumbrances, security interests, charges, mortgages and defects, except for liens permitted under the Credit Agreement and the Indenture or such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such properties by the Company or the Subsidiaries. 

^^The Company and each Subsidiary have, own, possess or have the right to employ all patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, trade names and other intellectual property (collectively, the “**Intellectual Property**”) necessary to conduct the businesses operated by them as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package, except where the failure to own, possess or have the right to employ such Intellectual Property could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with (and neither knows of any such infringement or a conflict with) asserted rights of others with respect to any of the foregoing that, if such assertion of infringement or conflict were sustained, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The use of the Intellectual Property in connection with the business and operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any person, except for such infringement as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

^^The Company and each of the Subsidiaries have filed all federal, state, local or foreign income and franchise tax returns required to be filed and all such returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries have paid all taxes shown thereon as due, and there is no material tax deficiency which has been or is reasonably likely to be asserted against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; all material tax liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries are adequately provided for on the books of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

^^The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (“**ERISA**”), except where the failure to be in such compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; no “reportable event” (as defined in ERISA and with respect to which the 30-day notice provision has not been waived) has occurred with respect to any “pension plan” (as defined in ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA for which the Company or any Subsidiary would have liability; except for matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur liability under (A) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any “pension plan” or (B) Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (“**Code**”); and each “pension plan” for which the Company and the Subsidiaries would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all material respects and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. 

(aa) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the sale of the Securities will not involve any nonexempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406(a) of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1)(A) of the Code. 

(bb) The Company is subject to and in compliance in all material respects with the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

(cc) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an “investment company” that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act; and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be, an “investment company” or a company “controlled” by an “investment company” incorporated in the United States within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. 

(dd) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for its assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

(ee) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company by others within the Company or any Subsidiary, and such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably effective to perform the functions for which they were established subject to the limitations of any such control system. The Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company have been advised of: (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As of [[Date 3]], the Company and the Subsidiaries’ internal controls over financial reporting were reasonably effective to perform the functions for which they were established, subject to the limitations of any such control system, and the Company and the Subsidiaries are not aware of any material weakness in their internal control over financial reporting. 

(ff) None of the Company or any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 501(b) of Regulation D under the Act) has taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to, cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. 

(gg) The Company has not made any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Act (other than those listed on Schedule V hereto) without the prior consent of the Underwriters. 

(hh) No forward-looking statement (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act) contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package has been made or reaffirmed without a reasonable basis or has been disclosed other than in good faith. 

^^^As of [[Date 3]], none of the Company or any Subsidiary had any material liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that were not set forth in the consolidated balance sheet as of such date or in the notes thereto set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus. Since [[Date 3]], except as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, (a) none of the Company or any Subsidiary has (1) incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (2) entered into any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business, or (3) purchased any of its outstanding capital stock, (b) there has not been any material adverse change, prospective change, event or development in respect of the business, properties, prospects, results of operations or condition (financial or other) of the Company and the Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of capital stock and (d) there has not been any material change in the capital stock, short-term debt or long-term debt of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

(kk) Except as described in the section entitled “Underwriting” in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other person other than the Underwriters that would give rise to a valid claim against, the Company, any Subsidiary or the Underwriters for a brokerage commission, finder’s fee or like payment in connection with the issuance, purchase and sale of the Securities. 

(ll) The industry, statistical and market-related data included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus are based on or derived from sources that the Company reasonably and in good faith believes to be reliable and accurate in all material respects and represent its good faith estimates that are made on the basis of data derived from such sources.

^Indemnification. 

^^The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriters, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, the agents, employees, affiliates, officers and directors of any Underwriter and the agents, employees, affiliates, officers and directors of any such controlling person from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and any and all reasonable expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all reasonable amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation) (collectively, “**Losses**”) to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; *provided*, *however*, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission relating to an Underwriter made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to an Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, liability under this Agreement. 

^^Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and each of their respective agents, employees, officers and directors and the agents, employees, officers and directors of any such controlling person from and against any Losses to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission relating to such Underwriter made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. The Company and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, acknowledge that the information set forth in Section 9 is the only information furnished in writing by the Underwriters to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus. 

^^Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection 6(a) or 6(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding (collectively, an “**action**”), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the commencement of such action (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in such action, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such action, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) the named parties to such action (including any impleaded parties) include such indemnified party and the indemnifying parties (or such indemnifying parties have assumed the defense of such action), and such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them that are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), or (iv) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 Business Days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 45 days prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. 

^Contribution. 

^^In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement is for any reason held to be unavailable from the indemnifying party, or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified under Section 6 of this Agreement, each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such aggregate Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the offering of the Securities (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company are to (y) the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters as set forth in this Agreement. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission. 

^^The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) in no case shall any Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount and commissions applicable to the Securities pursuant to this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Underwriters shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this Section 7, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 7 or otherwise, except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure; *provided*, *however*, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 6 for purposes of indemnification. Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, no party shall be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent, *provided*, *however*, that such written consent was not unreasonably withheld. The obligations of the Underwriters to make any contributions pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall be several and not joint. 

^Conditions of Underwriters’ Obligations.The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Underwritten Securities and the Option Securities, as the case may be, as provided for in this Agreement, shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions prior to or concurrently with such purchase:
