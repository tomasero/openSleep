^Pursuant to the terms of the Offer, Purchaser will offer for each Company Share validly tendered to the Offer an amount equal to EUR 117 in cash, without interest, or should the Company pay any dividend or make any distribution between the date of the Agreement and the settlement and delivery of the Offer, an amount equal to EUR 117 in cash reduced by the amount per Company Share of such dividend or of such distribution (the “**Offer Price**”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

^The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have approved the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

^Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain agreements in connection with the Offer.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as follows:

^**THE OFFER**

^^**Announcement**

Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall issue an agreed upon press release announcing the Offer (the “**Public Announcement**”), including among other items a decision of the Company Board stating expressly its intention to recommend the Offer subject to the receipt of a Favorable Report (as such term is defined below).

^^**Independent Expert - Board Recommendation**

^^If not already appointed prior to the date hereof, not later than the day of the Public Announcement, the Company shall appoint an independent expert (the “**Independent Expert**”), to prepare a report pursuant to Article 261-1 et seq. of the General Regulations of the *Autorité des marchés financiers* (the “**AMF**”) including a fairness opinion stating whether the Offer Price is fair to the Company’s shareholders from a financial point of view (the “**Independent Expert Report**”).

^^Upon receipt of the Independent Expert Report that includes the opinion of the Independent Expert that the Offer Price is fair to the Company’s shareholders from a financial point of view (a “**Favorable Report**”), the Company Board shall confirm as soon as possible and in any event within three Business Days from the date of the Independent Expert Report that the Offer is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and its employees and recommend that all holders of Company Shares tender such shares into the Offer (the “**Company Board Recommendation**”).

^^In the event the Company is informed by the Independent Expert that it will issue an Independent Expert Report which is not a Favorable Report, the Company shall immediately inform Parent, and the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith with a view towards making such commercially reasonable amendments to the terms of the Offer as would permit a Favorable Report to be issued, subject to approval of the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of the Company and provided that in no case shall Purchaser and Parent be obligated to increase the Offer Price. If such negotiations are unsuccessful after five Business Days and the Company Board Recommendation is not issued, then Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

^^The Company shall file the draft target prospectus (*projet de note d’information en réponse*) including the Independent Expert Report on the second Business Day following the Company Board Recommendation.

^^In addition, Purchaser shall have the right to amend the terms of the draft tender offer prospectus after it is filed with the AMF, (i) to the extent required to reflect comments from the AMF, subject to prior notice to the Company, and (ii) in other cases, in the event such amendments relate to sections 1.2 and 2.1, 2.6 and 2.7 of the draft tender offer prospectus, they shall not make the Offer materially less favorable to the Company, its employees and its shareholders and subject to prior consultation with the Company. Reciprocally, the Company will provide a draft of its initial draft target prospectus at least three Business Days before filing it with the AMF and will take into consideration any reasonable comments from Purchaser to the extent reasonably practicable and promptly provided. In addition, the Company shall have the right to amend the draft target prospectus after it is filed with the AMF (i) to the extent required to reflect comments from the AMF, subject to prior notice to Purchaser, and (ii) in other cases, subject to prior consultation with Purchaser.

^^**Offer Conditions**

^^The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours following receipt or knowledge thereof) advise Parent of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal (including any change to the terms of any such Takeover Proposal) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal . The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully informed of the status of any such Takeover Proposal and (ii) promptly advise Parent of any amendments to the terms of any such Takeover Proposal.

**Superior Proposal** means any bona fide binding written fully financed offer not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary made by a third party that if consummated would result in such third party acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Company Shares (by merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (A) for consideration that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Shares to the Offer, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal, this Agreement and any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, and (B) that, in the good faith judgment of the

Company Board, is otherwise reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal.
