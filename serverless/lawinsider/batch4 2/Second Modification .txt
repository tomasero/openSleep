^All capitalized terms used herein, except as modified hereby shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Loan Documents.

^The Maturity Date is hereby extended from [[Date 1]] until [[Date 4: Date]], at which time all amounts due and owing under the Note shall be due and payable without notice or demand.

monthly Revolving Credit Loan outstanding balance shall include but not be limited to the aggregate amounts of any and all letters of credit that may be issued by Bank in connection with the sub-line available to Borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 2.02(b) hereof); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such fee if such fee arises solely due to the Bank's decision to cease making Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower.”

In no event shall the Borrowing Base on any date be deemed to exceed the amount of the Borrowing Base shown on the Borrowing Base Certificate last received by Bank prior to such date, as such Borrowing Base Certificate may be adjusted from time to time by Bank as authorized herein. If Borrower fails to deliver to Bank the Borrowing Base Certificate on the date when due, then notwithstanding any of the provisions contained herein o r in any other Loan Document to the contrary, Bank may suspend honoring any requests for Loans until a current Borrowing Base Certificate is delivered to Bank.”

^**Schedule 5.01(i)** attached to the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted, and the revised **Schedule 5.01(i)** which is attached to this Agreement shall be inserted in lieu thereof and shall be considered a replacement thereof.
