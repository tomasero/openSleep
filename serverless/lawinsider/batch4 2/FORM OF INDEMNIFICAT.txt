THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of the day of , 20 , by and between [[Organization 1 Name]], a Maryland real estate investment trust (the “Company”), and (“Indemnitee”).

WHEREAS, at the request of the Company, Indemnitee currently serves as [a trustee] [and] [an officer] of the Company and may, therefore, be subjected to claims, suits or proceedings arising as a result of his service; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Indemnitee to continue to serve as [a trustee] [and] [an officer], the Company has agreed to indemnify and to advance expenses and costs incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any such claims, suits or proceedings, to the maximum extent permitted by law; and

WHEREAS, the parties by this Agreement desire to set forth their agreement regarding indemnification and advance of expenses.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

^Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

^^“Change in Control” means a change in control of the Company occurring after the Effective Date of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any similar item on any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided, however, that, without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if, after the Effective Date (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing [[Percentage 1: Number]]% or more of the combined voting power of all of the Company’s then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees without the prior approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Trustees in office immediately prior to such person’s attaining such percentage interest; (ii) the Company is a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, plan of liquidation or other reorganization not approved by at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Trustees then in office, as a consequence of which members of the Board of Trustees in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board of Trustees thereafter; or (iii) at any time, a majority of the members of the Board of Trustees are not individuals (A) who were trustees as of the Effective Date or (B) whose election by the Board of Trustees or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders was approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the trustees then in office who were trustees as of the Effective Date or whose nomination for election was previously so approved**.**

^^“Company Status” means the status of a person as a present or former trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Company or as a director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint 

venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company. As a clarification and without limiting the circumstances in which Indemnitee may be serving at the request of the Company, service by Indemnitee shall be deemed to be at the request of the Company if Indemnitee serves or served as a director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (i) of which a majority of the voting power or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company or (ii) the management of which is controlled directly or indirectly by the Company.

^^“Disinterested Trustee” means a trustee of the Company who is not and was not a party to a Proceeding in respect of which indemnification and/or advance of Expenses is sought by Indemnitee.

^^“Effective Date” means the date set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement.

^^“Expenses” means any and all reasonable and out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and costs, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and any other disbursements or expenses incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in or otherwise participating in a Proceeding. Expenses shall also include Expenses incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding including, without limitation, the premium, security for and other costs relating to any cost bond supersedeas bond or other appeal bond or its equivalent.

^^“Independent Counsel” means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporate law and neither is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with respect to matters concerning Indemnitee under this Agreement or of other indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements) or (ii) any other party to or participant or witness in the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification or advance of Expenses hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Independent Counsel” shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement.

^^“Proceeding” means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Company or otherwise and whether of a civil (including intentional or unintentional tort claims), criminal, administrative or investigative (formal or informal) nature, including any appeal therefrom, except one pending or completed on or before the Effective Date, unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the Company and Indemnitee. If Indemnitee reasonably believes that a given situation may lead to or culminate in the institution of a Proceeding, such situation shall also be considered a Proceeding.

^Services by Indemnitee. Indemnitee will serve as [a trustee] [and] [an officer] of the Company. However, this Agreement shall not impose any independent obligation on Indemnitee or the Company to continue Indemnitee’s service to the Company. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any other entity) and Indemnitee.

^General. The Company shall indemnify, and advance Expenses to, Indemnitee (a) as provided in this Agreement and (b) otherwise to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect on the Effective Date and as amended from time to time; provided, however, that no change in Maryland law shall have the effect of reducing the benefits available to Indemnitee hereunder based on Maryland law as in effect on the Effective Date. The rights of Indemnitee provided in this Section 3 shall include, without limitation, the rights set forth in the other sections of this Agreement, including any additional indemnification permitted by Section 2-418(g) of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”), as applicable to a Maryland real estate investment trust by virtue of Section 8-301(15) of the Maryland REIT Law.

^Standard for Indemnification. If, by reason of Indemnitee’s Company Status, Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party to any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any such Proceeding unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the Proceeding and (i) was committed in bad faith or (ii) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal Proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

^Certain Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (other than Section 6) Indemnitee shall not be entitled to:

^^indemnification hereunder if the Proceeding was one by or in the right of the Company and Indemnitee is adjudged to be liable to the Company;

^^indemnification hereunder if Indemnitee is adjudged to be liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received in any Proceeding charging improper personal benefit to Indemnitee, whether or not involving action in the Indemnitee’s Company Status; or

^^indemnification or advance of Expenses hereunder if the Proceeding was brought by Indemnitee unless (i) the Proceeding was brought to enforce indemnification under this Agreement, and then only to the extent in accordance with and as authorized by Section 12 of this Agreement, or (ii) the Company’s declaration of trust or Bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees or of the 

Board of Trustees or an agreement approved by the Board of Trustees to which the Company is a party expressly provide otherwise.

^Court-Ordered Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a court of appropriate jurisdiction, upon application of Indemnitee and such notice as the court shall require, may order indemnification in the following circumstances:

^^if it determines Indemnitee is entitled to reimbursement under Section 2-418(d)(1) of the MGCL, the court shall order indemnification, in which case Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the Expenses of securing such reimbursement; or

^^if it determines that Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not Indemnitee (i) has met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 2-418(b) of the MGCL or (ii) has been adjudged liable for receipt of an improper personal benefit under Section 2-418(c) of the MGCL, the court may order such indemnification as the court shall deem proper. However, indemnification with respect to any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company or in which liability shall have been adjudged in the circumstances described in Section 2-418(c) of the MGCL shall be limited to Expenses.

^Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and without limiting any such provision, to the extent that Indemnitee was or is, by reason of his Company Status, made a party to (or otherwise becomes a participant in) any Proceeding and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of such Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee under this Section 7 for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each such claim, issue or matter, allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. For purposes of this Section 7 and, without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.

^Advance of Expenses for a Party. If, by reason of Indemnitee’s Company Status, Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party to any Proceeding, the Company shall, without requiring a preliminary determination of Indemnitee’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification hereunder, advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding within ten days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written affirmation by Indemnitee of Indemnitee’s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company as authorized by law and by this Agreement has been met and a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or in such form as may be required under applicable law as in effect at the time of the execution thereof, to reimburse the portion of any Expenses advanced to Indemnitee relating to claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which it shall ultimately be established that the standard of conduct has not been met by Indemnitee and which have not been successfully resolved as described in Section 7 of this Agreement. To the extent that Expenses advanced to Indemnitee do not relate to a specific claim, issue or matter in the Proceeding, such Expenses shall be allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. The undertaking required by this Section 8 shall be an unlimited general obligation by or on behalf of Indemnitee and shall be accepted without reference to Indemnitee’s financial ability to repay such advanced Expenses and without any requirement to post security therefor.

^Indemnification and Advance of Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is or may be, by reason of his Company Status, made a witness or otherwise asked to participate in any Proceeding, whether instituted by the Company or any other party, and to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be advanced all reasonable Expenses and indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith within ten days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee.

^Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.

^^To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. Indemnitee may submit one or more such requests from time to time and at such time(s) as Indemnitee deems appropriate in his sole discretion. The officer of the Company receiving any such request from Indemnitee shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Trustees in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.

^^Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) above, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement thereto shall promptly be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel, in a written opinion to the Board of Trustees, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, which Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee and approved by the Board of Trustees in accordance with Section 2-418(e)(2)(ii) of the MGCL, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by the Board of Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Trustees or, if such a quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote of a duly authorized committee of the Board of Trustees consisting solely of one or more Disinterested Trustees, (B) if Independent Counsel has been selected by the Board of Trustees in accordance with Section 2-418(e)(2)(ii) of the MGCL and approved by the Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, by Independent Counsel, in a written opinion to the 

Board of Trustees, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (C) if so directed by a majority of the members of the Board of Trustees, by the shareholders of the Company. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination in the discretion of the Board of Trustees or Independent Counsel if retained pursuant to clause (ii)(B) of this Section 10(b). Any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company shall indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

^^The Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel, if one is appointed.

^Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

^^In making any determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making of any determination contrary to that presumption.

^^The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, upon a plea of *nolo contendere* or its equivalent, or entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct described herein for indemnification.

^^The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any other director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining any other right to indemnification under this Agreement.

^Remedies of Indemnitee.

^^If (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advance of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this Agreement within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement within ten days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to any other section of this Agreement or the declaration of trust or Bylaws of the Company is not made within ten days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court located in the State of Maryland, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of his entitlement to such indemnification or advance of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence any such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 12(a); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply to a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 7 of this Agreement. Except as set forth herein, the provisions of Maryland law (without regard to its conflicts of laws rules) shall apply to any such arbitration. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.

^^In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses, as the case may be, under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses, as the case may be. If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Section 12, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement until a final determination is made with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed). The Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement.

^^If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, absent a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification.

^^In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 12, seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company for, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advance of Expenses sought, the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.

^^Interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at the maximum rate allowed to be charged for judgments under the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland for amounts which the Company pays or is obligated to pay for the period commencing with the date on which the Company was requested to advance expenses in accordance with Section 8 of this Agreement or was required to make the determination of entitlement to indemnification under Section 12(a) above and ending on the date such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company.

^Defense of the Underlying Proceeding.

^^Indemnitee shall notify the Company promptly in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, request or other document relating to any Proceeding which may result in the right to indemnification or the advance of Expenses hereunder and shall include with such notice a description of the nature of the Proceeding and a summary of the facts underlying the Proceeding. The failure to give any such notice shall not disqualify Indemnitee from the right, or otherwise affect in any manner any right of Indemnitee, to indemnification or the advance of Expenses under this Agreement unless the Company’s ability to defend in such Proceeding or to obtain proceeds under any insurance policy is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent the Company is thereby actually so prejudiced.

^^Subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 13(b) and of Section 13(c) below, the Company shall have the right to defend Indemnitee in any Proceeding which may give rise to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the Company shall notify Indemnitee of any such decision to defend within 15 calendar days following receipt of notice of any such Proceeding under Section 13(a) above. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment against Indemnitee or enter into any settlement or compromise which (i) includes an admission of fault of Indemnitee, (ii) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Proceeding, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee or (iii) would impose any Expense, judgment, fine, penalty or limitation on Indemnitee. This Section 13(b) shall not apply to a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee under Section 12 of this Agreement.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13(b) above, if in a Proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party by reason of Indemnitee’s Company Status, (i) Indemnitee reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that he may have separate defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be consistent with other defendants in such Proceeding, (ii) Indemnitee reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that an actual or apparent conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between Indemnitee and the Company, or (iii) if the Company fails to assume the defense of such Proceeding in a timely manner, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of Indemnitee’s choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company. In addition, if the Company fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any Proceeding to deny or to recover from Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall have the right to retain counsel of Indemnitee’s choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company (subject to Section 12(d) of this Agreement), to represent Indemnitee in connection with any such matter.

^Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Subrogation.

^^The rights of indemnification and advance of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the declaration of trust or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or a resolution of the shareholders entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees or of the Board of Trustees, or otherwise. Unless consented to in writing by Indemnitee, no amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Company Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal, regardless of whether a claim with respect to such action or inaction is raised prior or subsequent to such amendment, alteration or repeal. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prohibit the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

^^In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

^Insurance. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to acquire directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees, with the advice of counsel, covering Indemnitee or any claim made against Indemnitee by reason of his Company Status and covering the Company for any indemnification or advance of Expenses made by the Company to Indemnitee for any claims made against Indemnitee by reason of his Company Status. Without in any way limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee for any payment by Indemnitee arising out of the amount of any deductible or retention and the amount of any excess of the aggregate of all judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding over the coverage of any insurance referred to in the previous sentence. The purchase, establishment and maintenance of any such insurance shall not in any way limit or affect the rights or obligations of the Company or Indemnitee under this Agreement except as expressly provided herein, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Indemnitee shall not in any way limit or affect the rights or obligations of the Company under any such insurance policies. If, at the time the Company receives notice from any source of a Proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.

^**[Primacy of Indemnification;]**  Coordination of Payments.

(a)**[The Company hereby acknowledges that Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by The Yucaipa Companies and certain of its affiliates (including [[Organization 2 Name]], Yucaipa American Alliance (Parallel) Fund I, L.P., [[Organization 3 Name]], L.P., Yucaipa American Alliance (Parallel) Fund II, L.P. and** **[[Organization 4 Name]])** **(collectively, the “Fund Indemnitors”). The Company hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort for any claims made against Indemnitee by reason of his Company Status (*i.e.*, its obligations to Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of [[Organization 5 Name]] to advance Expenses or to provide indemnification for the same Expenses or liabilities incurred by Indemnitee by reason of his Company Status are secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of Expenses incurred by Indemnitee by reason of his Company Status and shall be liable for the full amount of all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement and the Company’s declaration of trust or Bylaws (or any other agreement between the Company and Indemnitee), without regard to any rights Indemnitee may have against [[Organization 5 Name]], and, (iii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases [[Organization 5 Name]] from any and all claims against [[Organization 5 Name]] for contribution or subrogation in respect of any claims made against Indemnitee by reason of his Company Status. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by [[Organization 5 Name]] on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall affect the foregoing and [[Organization 5 Name]] shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee against the Company as permitted by this Agreement. The Company and Indemnitee agree that [[Organization 5 Name]] are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 16(a).]**

^^**[Except as provided in paragraph (a) above, t][T]**he Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable or payable or reimbursable as Expenses hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. *[Include language in bold for trustees nominated by Yucaipa]*

^Reports to Shareholders. To the extent required by Maryland law, the Company shall report in writing to its shareholders the payment of any amounts for indemnification of, or advance of Expenses to, Indemnitee under this Agreement arising out of a

Proceeding by or in the right of the Company with the notice of the meeting of shareholders of the Company next following the date of the payment of any such indemnification or advance of Expenses or prior to such meeting.

^Duration of Agreement; Binding Effect.

^^This Agreement shall continue until and terminate on the later of (i) the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Company or as a director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company and (ii) the date that Indemnitee is no longer subject to any actual or possible Proceeding (including any rights of appeal thereto and any Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement).

^^The indemnification and advance of Expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or a director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives.

^^The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.

^^The Company and Indemnitee agree herein that a monetary remedy for breach of this Agreement, at some later date, may be inadequate, impracticable and difficult of proof, and further agree that such breach may cause Indemnitee irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that Indemnitee may enforce this Agreement by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance hereof, without any necessity of showing actual damage or irreparable harm and that by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance, Indemnitee shall not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which he may be entitled. Indemnitee shall further be entitled to such specific performance and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertakings in connection therewith. The Company acknowledges that, in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required of Indemnitee by a court, and the Company hereby waives any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking.

^Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.

^am subject to the Proceeding by reason of my Company Status or by reason of alleged actions or omissions by me in such capacity.

In consideration of the advance of Expenses by the Company for reasonable attorneys’ fees and related Expenses incurred by me in connection with the Proceeding (the “Advanced Expenses”), I hereby agree that if, in connection with the Proceeding, it is established that (1) an act or omission by me was material to the matter giving rise to the Proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty or (2) I actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, I had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful, then I shall promptly reimburse the portion of the Advanced Expenses relating to the claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which the foregoing findings have been established.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed this Affirmation and Undertaking on this day of , 20 .
