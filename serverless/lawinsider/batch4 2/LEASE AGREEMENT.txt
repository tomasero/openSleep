^^Premises:  
^^^Suite Number: 110 (estimate)

^^^Rentable Square Feet: 7,329 (estimate)

^^^Usable Square Feet: 7,329 (estimate)

^^Said Suite is in the office building (the **Building**) located or to be located on a ground leasehold estate (the “**Ground Leasehold Estate”**) under that certain **“Ground Lease”** (defined in Article 34 below) upon the land described in **Exhibit A** hereto (the “**Land**”).

The rentable area and usable area, as outlined on **Exhibit A-1,** are subject to adjustment pursuant to this paragraph. The square footage set forth above is subject to adjustment based upon the exact square footage contained in the Premises once the Premises have been completed. Upon completion of the Premises, Landlord will provide Tenant with an amendment outlining the exact square footage and the related adjustments to Minimum Rent and Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Additional Charges pursuant to Section 2.1 below;

SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the matters set forth on **Exhibit B** attached hereto, the Landlord’s Mortgage, the Medical Center Master Lease and the Ground Lease (the “**Permitted Exceptions**”), to have and to hold for a fixed term of twenty (20) years (the “**Initial Term**”) from and after the Commencement Date (hereafter defined) of the Lease and continuing for any Extension Term properly and timely elected pursuant to Article 33 hereof. The “**Term**” of this Lease shall be the Initial Term and any Extension Term exercised by Tenant pursuant to terms hereof. The Commencement Date of this Lease (the “**Commencement Date**”) shall be the first day of the first calendar month following the date on which Landlord has achieved Substantial Completion of Landlord’s Work (as defined in, and in accordance with, the work letter attached hereto and made a part hereof as **Exhibit E**) (the “**Work Letter**”).

\centered **RENT**

^^**Minimum Rent and Adjustments to Minimum Rent**. Commencing upon the Commencement Date and during the Term hereof, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, without notice, demand, set off or counterclaim, in advance in lawful money of the United States of America, the Minimum Rent, as adjusted annually pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof during the Term or as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof during the Term. Landlord and Tenant agree that, upon the execution of this Lease, the minimum rent amounts payable to Landlord in each Lease year as set forth on **Exhibit C** are only estimated minimum rents based upon a Preliminary Project Budget. Landlord and Tenant shall finalize the Final Construction Documents for the Project and the Final Project Budget in accordance with the terms of the Work Letter attached hereto as **Exhibit E**. The term “**Minimum Rent**” used throughout this Lease shall be determined as set forth in Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) below.

The Minimum Rent shall be payable in advance in twelve (12) equal, consecutive monthly installments, on the first day of each calendar month of the Term. Minimum Rent shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.1(b) below. Minimum Rent shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall be prorated on a daily basis if the Commencement Date is not the first day of a month for the remainder of that month. Rent shall be payable at such address as Landlord may designate from time to time by written notice to Tenant.

^^**Minimum Rent — Establishing Year One of the Lease Term**. The Final Project Budget specifically allocates a certain amount for “Contingencies.” The annual Minimum Rent for Year One of the Lease Term shall be Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the approved Final Project Budget, multiplied by a rental factor of **[***]**; provided, however, that (a) to the extent that the amount designated as “Contingencies” is not actually expended by Landlord in the course of completing Landlord’s Work, one half ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of such unused amount shall be deducted from the Final Project Budget prior to making such computation, and (b) to the extent that Tenant makes a Tenant Change Request which has the effect of reducing costs incurred by Landlord to Substantially Complete the Landlord’s Work, the amount of such reduction shall be deducted from the Final Project Budget prior to making such computation. Once the Minimum Rent for Year One of the Lease Term has been determined in accordance herewith, Landlord and Tenant shall a execute a revised **Exhibit C - Rent Schedule** reflecting the final Minimum Rent due in each year of the Initial Lease Term and any Extension Terms and each shall attach this revised Exhibit C- Rent Schedule** to this Lease and clearly mark and identify it as having been calculated in accordance herewith.

^^**Increases to Minimum Rent**. Minimum Rent due and payable for all years of the Lease Term following Year One of the Lease Term shall increase annually on each anniversary of the Commencement Date during the Term or Extension Term of this Lease at a rate of **[*****]** per annum above the Minimum Rent payable for the immediately previous year.

^^**Additional Charges**. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within five (5) business days following receipt of Landlord’s invoice for Tenant’s Proportionate Share (as defined hereafter in Article 34) of (a) any amounts due by Landlord under any assessments, taxes (described in Section 3.1 below), fees, insurance, rental and parking fees payable under the Ground Lease, property management fees (not to exceed [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the sum of Minimum Rent and Additional Charges payable under all leases within the Building), accounting fees, or other charges related to the ownership and leasing of the Premises that accrue during the Term of this Lease and all expenditures of Landlord under Sections 7.1(a) and 7.2, and (b) in the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any of those items referred to in clause (a) above of which it received all notice required hereunder, Tenant will also promptly pay and discharge every fine, penalty, interest and cost which may be added for non-payment or late payment of such items (the items referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above being referred to herein collectively as the “**Additional Charges**”), and Landlord shall have all legal, equitable and contractual rights, powers and remedies provided in this Lease, by statute or otherwise, in the case of non-payment of the Additional Charges, as well as the Minimum Rent. If any installment of Minimum Rent or Additional Charges (but only as to those Additional Charges which are payable directly to Landlord) shall not be paid within five (5) business days after the date when due, Tenant will pay Landlord on demand, as Additional Charges, interest (to the extent permitted by law) computed at the Overdue Rate on the amount of such installment, from the date when due to Landlord to the date of payment in full thereof.

The Minimum Rent, Additional Charges and Impositions are collectively referred to herein as “**Rent**.”

^^**Common Area Electrical Costs.** As a portion of Additional Charges, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to the product of (i) the cost of all electricity used by the Building (excluding any electricity used solely by the Premises and separately metered pursuant to Section 3.3 below) (**Common Area Electrical Costs**), multiplied by (ii) Tenant’s Proportionate Share. Such amount shall be 1/12th of Landlord’s estimate of the amount due for the calendar year, and shall be due on the Commencement Date and on the first day of each calendar month thereafter; provided that, the amount due for any fractional calendar year following the Commencement Date or preceding the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease shall be prorated. Landlord shall have the right to reasonably adjust the amount of the annual estimate of Common Area Electrical Costs from time to time during the year based upon factors included in the determination of Common Area Electrical Costs. In the event of any change in the estimate of annual Common Area Electrical Costs, the monthly amount payable by Tenant shall be adjusted so that the full amount of any increase or decrease in the estimate of Tenant’s Proportionate Share for such year shall be given effect or paid at the end of such year. Any abnormal electrical use attributable to Tenant, as reasonably determined by Landlord, shall be billed directly to Tenant and shall not be included in the calculation of Common Area Electrical Costs under this Lease.

^^**Net Lease**. Except for Landlord’s construction obligations set forth in the Work Letter attached hereto as **Exhibit E** to this Lease, such other expenses which Landlord has agreed hereunder shall be Landlord’s responsibility and any indemnity obligations owing by Landlord to Tenant under the terms of this Lease, this is an absolutely net lease and the Minimum Rent, Additional Charges and all other sums payable hereunder by Tenant shall be paid without notice (except as expressly provided herein), demand, set-off, counterclaim, abatement, suspension, deduction or defense. It is the intention of the parties hereto that, except as expressly provided herein, the Minimum Rent shall be an absolutely net return to Landlord throughout the Term of this Lease.

^^**Security for Lease**. Upon the execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in immediately available funds, a security deposit in the amount of $[[USD Value 10: Number]] ZERO DOLLARS (the “Security Deposit”), which shall be held by Landlord without liability for interest and as security for the performance by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease. The Security Deposit is not an advance payment of Rent or a measure or limit of Landlord’s damages upon an Event of Default (defined below). Landlord may, from time to time and without prejudice to any other remedy, use all or a part of the Security Deposit to perform any obligation, which Tenant was obligated, but failed, to perform hereunder. Following any such application of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount so applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Within a reasonable time after the Term ends, provided Tenant has performed all of its obligations hereunder, Landlord shall return to Tenant the balance of the Security Deposit not applied to satisfy Tenant’s obligations. If Landlord transfers its interest in the Premises, then Landlord may assign the Security Deposit to the transferee and Landlord thereafter shall have no further liability for the return of the Security Deposit

^^**Proration of Impositions**. Impositions imposed in respect of the tax-fiscal period during which the Term commences and the period in which the Term expires or terminates shall be prorated between Landlord and Tenant, whether or not such Impositions are imposed before or after such termination, and Tenant’s and Landlord’s obligation to pay their prorated shares thereof shall survive such termination.

Losses shall be payable to Landlord and/or Tenant as provided herein. In addition, the holder (“**Landlord’s Mortgagee**”) of any mortgage, deed of trust or other security agreement securing any Encumbrance placed on the Premises in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 (“**Landlord’s Mortgage**”) shall be the loss payee under the property coverage (or, if there is no Landlord’s Mortgagee, then Landlord shall be designated as the loss payee). Certificates of insurance shall be delivered to Landlord and Landlord’s Mortgagee(s) upon Landlord’s written request.

^^**Additional Insurance**. In addition to the insurance described above, Tenant shall maintain such additional insurance as may be reasonably required from time to time by Landlord or any Landlord’s Mortgagee which is consistent with insurance coverage in the city, county and state where the Premises is located, or required pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement and shall at all times maintain adequate worker’s compensation insurance coverage for all persons employed by Tenant on the Premises, in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

^^**Waiver of Subrogation**. All insurance policies carried by either party covering the Premises, the Fixtures, the Building, the Project and/or the Personal Property, including contents, fire and casualty insurance, shall expressly waive any right of subrogation on the part of the insurer against the other party. The parties hereto agree that their policies will include such a waiver clause or endorsement so long as the same is obtainable without extra cost, and in the event of such an extra charge the other party, at its election, may request and pay the same, but shall not be obligated to do so.

^^**Form of Insurance**. Tenant shall pay all premiums for insurance required hereby and deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Landlord prior to their effective date (and, with respect to any renewal policy, at least twenty (20) days prior to the expiration of the existing policy). Each insurer mentioned in this Section shall agree, by endorsement on the policy or policies issued by it, or by independent instrument furnished to Landlord, to endeavor to give to Landlord prior written notice before the policy or policies in question shall be altered, allowed to expire or canceled.

^^**Change in Limits**. In the event that Landlord shall at any time reasonably and in good faith believe the limits of the personal injury, property damage or general public liability insurance then carried to be insufficient, the parties shall endeavor to agree on the proper and reasonable limits for such insurance to be carried and such insurance shall thereafter be carried with the limits thus agreed on until further change pursuant to the provisions of this Section. If the parties shall be unable to agree thereon, the proper and reasonable limits for such insurance shall be determined by an impartial third party selected by the parties the costs of which shall be divided equally between the parties. Such redeterminations, whether made by the parties or by arbitration, shall be made no more frequently than every five (5) years. Nothing herein shall permit the amount of insurance to be reduced below the amount or amounts required by any Landlord’s Mortgagee.

^^**Self Insurance/Blanket Policy**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 11, Tenant’s obligations to carry the insurance provided in this Article 11 and as set forth on **Exhibit G** may be satisfied by Tenant’s existing self-insurance trust fund arrangement (provided that such trust fund shall at all times contain $[[USD Value 2: Number]] or more) or a comparable program of self insurance respecting general liability and property claims, or within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried and maintained by Tenant or any member of Tenant; provided that the coverage afforded Landlord will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be different from that which would exist under separate policies meeting all other requirements of this Lease (e.g., “all risk” property coverage is scheduled with full limits for this location and the general liability and medical professional liability policies include per location aggregate language); provided further that the requirements of this Article 11 are otherwise satisfied.

^^**No Separate Insurance**. Subject to Section 11.6 above, without the prior written consent of Landlord, Tenant shall not, on Tenant’s own initiative or pursuant to the request or requirement of any third party, take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in this Article 11 to be furnished by, or which may reasonably be required by a Landlord’s Mortgagee to be furnished by, Tenant, or increase the amounts of any then-existing insurance required under this Article 11 by securing an additional policy or additional policies, unless the loss is payable under said insurance in the same manner as losses are required to be payable under this Lease. Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord of the taking out of any such separate insurance or of the increasing of any of the amounts of the then-existing insurance required under this Article 11 by securing an additional policy or additional policies.

^^**Landlord’s Insurance Obligations.** During the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall at all times maintain insurance covering all areas of the Project which do not constitute a part of the Premises. The kinds and amounts of insurance shall be as Landlord deems necessary and appropriate, or as may be required by Landlord’s Mortgagee or Ground Lessor, and shall be written by companies authorized to do insurance business in the state in which the Premises is located and with an AM Best rating of at least A VIII (or comparable rating). Landlord’s Mortgagee shall be the loss payee under the property coverage (or, if there is no Landlord’s Mortgagee, then Landlord shall be designated as the loss payee). Certificates of insurance shall be delivered to Tenant upon Tenant’s written request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, Landlord’s obligations to carry the insurance provided for herein may be brought within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried and maintained by Landlord and its Affiliates; provided that the coverage afforded Landlord will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be different from that which would exist under separate policies meeting all other requirements of this Lease (e.g., “all risk” property coverage is scheduled with full limits for this location and the general liability policy includes per location aggregate language); provided further that the requirements of this Section 11.8 are otherwise satisfied.

^^**Reconstruction in the Event of Damage or Destruction Covered by Insurance**. Except as provided in Section 12.6, and subject to the terms of any Landlord’s Mortgage, if during the Term, the Premises are partially destroyed from a risk covered by the insurance described in Article 11, Landlord shall apply all proceeds payable with respect thereto to restore the Premises to substantially the same condition as existed immediately before the damage or destruction. Such damage or destruction shall not terminate this Lease.

^^**Reconstruction in the Event of Damage or Destruction Not Covered by Insurance**. Subject to the terms of any Landlord’s Mortgage, if during the Term the Premises are partially destroyed by a risk not covered by the insurance described in Article 11, Landlord shall have the option, in its sole discretion to (i) restore the Premises to substantially the same condition it was in immediately before such damage or destruction or (ii) terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s receipt of notice from the applicable insurer that the damage will not be covered by insurance.

^^**Abatement of Rent**. Notwithstanding any loss or damage to the Premises or to Tenant’s Personal Property, unless this Lease is terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however, Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent when due as required by this Lease shall abate beginning on the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of damage or destruction and shall continue abated until the Premises are sufficiently repaired and restored to allow Tenant to reoccupy the Premises.

^^**Damage Near End of Term**. Notwithstanding any provisions of Sections 12.2 or 12.3 to the contrary, if damage to or destruction of the Premises occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the Initial Term or an Extension Term, and if in Landlord’s commercially reasonable opinion, such damage or destruction cannot be fully repaired and restored within the lesser of (i) six (6) months or (ii) the period remaining in the Term or Extension Term immediately following the date of loss, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the date of damage or destruction, in which event Landlord shall be entitled to retain the insurance proceeds, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount of any deductible or uninsured loss arising in connection therewith; provided that any such notice given by Landlord shall be void and of no force and effect if Tenant exercises any available option to extend the Term for one Extension Term, or one additional Extension Term, as the case may be, within thirty (30) days following receipt of such termination notice.

^^**Waiver**. Tenant hereby waives any statutory or common law rights of termination which may arise by reason of any damage or destruction of the Premises.

^^**Total Taking**. If there is a Taking of all of the Premises by Condemnation, this Lease shall terminate effective as of the Date of Taking, and the Minimum Rent and all Additional Charges paid or payable hereunder shall be apportioned and paid to the Date of Taking.

^^**Partial Taking**. If there is a Taking of a portion of the Premises by Condemnation such that the Premises are not thereby rendered Unsuitable for its Permitted Use in the commercially reasonable opinion of Landlord and Tenant, this Lease shall remain in effect. If, however, the Premises are thereby rendered Unsuitable for its Permitted Use in Landlord and Tenant’s mutual commercially reasonable opinion, Tenant shall have the right, subject to the terms of the Landlord’s Mortgage (a) to take such proceeds of any Award as shall be necessary and restore the Premises, at its own expense, to the extent possible, to substantially the same condition as existed immediately before the partial Taking, or (b) to terminate this Lease, in which case all proceeds of any Award shall belong to Landlord. Tenant shall immediately provide Landlord with notice of any partial Taking and Tenant’s opinion concerning the suitability of the Premises for its Permitted Use. Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after such notice of partial Taking, advise Tenant of its opinion concerning whether or not the Premises is, after the partial Taking rendered Unsuitable for its Permitted Use. Tenant shall exercise any one of its above stated options by giving Landlord notice thereof within sixty (60) days after Tenant receives Landlord’s notice concerning the suitability of the Premises for its Permitted Use after the partial Taking. In the event that this Lease is terminated pursuant hereto, this Lease shall terminate effective as of the Date of Taking, and the Minimum Rent and all Additional Charges paid or payable hereunder shall be apportioned and paid to the Date of Taking.

^^**Restoration**. If there is a partial Taking of the Premises and this Lease remains in full force and effect pursuant to Section 13.3, Tenant shall commence all necessary restoration of the Premises within thirty (30) days (or as soon as practicable after the receipt of any necessary permits or approvals, whichever is later) after the date Tenant has delivered notice to Landlord of its election to restore the Premises and shall diligently pursue the completion of the restoration as soon as reasonably possible.

^^**Award Distribution**. Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.3 above, in any other event, the entire Award shall belong to and be paid to Landlord, except that, in all instances, (a) Tenant shall be entitled to a separate award or damages equal to the value of any removable Trade Fixtures and Personal Property installed by Tenant at its own cost in the Premises; and (b) Tenant shall be entitled to seek separate award and damages for relocation expenses and loss of business resulting from such Taking, provided that any award payable to Tenant would not reduce the amount of the Award that Landlord would otherwise be entitled to receive. Landlord and Tenant agree to work together in a coordinated effort in the filing of their respective separate claims for any such awards and shall each file all necessary pleadings or other documents to support the other’s position.

^^**Temporary Taking**. The Taking of the Premises, or any part thereof, by military or other public authority shall constitute a Taking by Condemnation only when the use and occupancy by the Taking authority has continued for longer than twelve (12) months. During the period after such initial twelve (12) month period all the provisions of this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and the Rent shall not be abated or reduced during such period of Taking; provided that Tenant will receive any compensation from the Taking authority as a result of such temporary Taking.

^^if the Financial Statements of any of Tenant, or any of its subsidiaries or members, as the case may be, provided under this Lease to Landlord in connection with the execution of this Lease prove to have been untrue in any material respect when made, and reliance on such Financial Statements causes an adverse impact to Landlord.

^^**Remedies**. If an Event of Default shall have occurred, Landlord shall have the right at its election, then or at any time thereafter, to pursue any one or more of the following remedies, in addition to any remedies which may be permitted by law or by other provisions of this Lease, without further notice or demand, except as hereinafter provided:

^^Without any notice or demand whatsoever, Landlord may take any one or more actions permissible at law to ensure performance by Tenant of Tenant’s covenants and obligations under this Lease. In this regard, it is agreed that if Tenant abandons or vacates the Premises, Landlord may enter upon and take possession of such Premises in order to protect it from deterioration and continue to demand from Tenant the monthly Minimum Rent and the Additional Charges provided in this Lease. Landlord shall use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to relet and thereby mitigate its damages but shall have no absolute obligation to relet. If Landlord does elect to relet the Premises, such action by Landlord shall not be deemed as an acceptance of Tenant’s surrender of the Premises unless Landlord expressly notifies Tenant of such acceptance in writing, Tenant hereby acknowledging that Landlord shall otherwise be reletting as Tenant’s agent. It is further agreed in this regard that in the event of any Event of Default described in this Article 14, Landlord shall have the right to enter upon the Premises and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease; and Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for any reasonable expenses which Landlord may incur in thus effecting compliance with Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, and further agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to Tenant from such action provided that Landlord is not negligent in the performance of Tenant’s lease obligations.

^^Landlord may (i) terminate this Lease or (ii) terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises without terminating this Lease by written notice to Tenant, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which Landlord may have for possession or arrearage in rent (including any interest which may have accrued pursuant to Section 2 of this Lease or otherwise), enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof. In addition, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord on demand the amount of all loss and damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of any termination effected pursuant to this subsection (b), said loss and damage to be determined, at Landlord’s option, by either of the following alternative measures of damages:

^^^Landlord shall be obligated to use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts, to relet the Premises, until the Premises is relet Tenant shall pay to Landlord on or before the first day of each calendar month the monthly Minimum Rent and other Additional Charges provided in this Lease. After the Premises has been relet by Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on the tenth (10th) day of each calendar month the difference between the monthly Minimum Rent and Additional Charges provided in this Lease for the preceding calendar month and that actually collected by Landlord for such month; provided that such collections are less than the Minimum Rental and Additional Charges due under this Lease. If it is necessary for Landlord to bring suit in order to collect any deficiency, Landlord shall have a right to allow such deficiencies to accumulate and to bring an action on several or all of the accrued deficiencies at one time. Any such suit shall not prejudice in any way the right of Landlord to bring a similar action for any subsequent deficiency or deficiencies. Any amount collected by Landlord from subsequent tenants for any calendar month in excess of the monthly Minimum Rent and Additional Charges provided in this Lease shall be credited to Tenant in reduction of Tenant’s liability for any calendar month for which the amount collected by Landlord will be less than the monthly Minimum Rent and Additional Charges provided in this Lease; but Tenant shall have no right to such excess other than the above described credit; or

^^^When Landlord desires, Landlord may demand a final settlement equal to the total of all Minimum Rent and Additional Charges provided in this Lease for the remainder of the Term, discounted to present value at a rate consistent with industry standards at the time of such determination and allowed by applicable law, minus the rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the Term, discounted to present value at a rate consistent with industry standards at the time of such determination and allowed by applicable law.

^^^After an Event of Default has occurred and prior to any final settlement action taken by Landlord under Section 14.2(b)(ii) above, in order to collect upon and manage the Additional Charges (which are not required to be paid to Landlord monthly under the other provisions of this Lease), Landlord shall be permitted to make a reasonable estimate of the Additional Charges due under this Lease during each Lease Year and may require Tenant to pay the estimated Additional Charges together with the monthly Minimum Rent prorated on a monthly basis. Landlord shall be obligated to remit to Tenant any excess over actual Additional Charges collected by Landlord within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each Lease Term. All such sums collected by Landlord as estimated Additional Charges shall be used by Landlord to pay such Additional Charges, except to the extent that Tenant has failed to make all Minimum Rent payments to Landlord, in which event, Landlord may, at its election, apply such sums collected as estimated Additional Charges to past due Minimum Rent payments and any late fees charged to Tenant.

The rights and remedies of Landlord hereunder are cumulative, and pursuit of any of the above remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any other remedies prescribed in other sections of this Lease and any other remedies provided by law or equity. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an Event of Default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such Event of Default.

^^**Additional Expenses**. In addition to payments required pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of Section 14.2 above, Tenant shall compensate Landlord for all reasonable expenses incurred by Landlord in repossessing the Premises (including any increase in insurance premiums caused by the vacancy of the Premises), all reasonable expenses incurred by Landlord in reletting (including repairs, remodeling, replacements, advertisements and brokerage fees), all reasonable concessions granted to a new tenant upon reletting (including renewal options), all fees and expenses incurred by Landlord as a direct or indirect result of any appropriate action by a Landlord’s Mortgagee, any expenses of Landlord incurred for the installation of separate lines or meters for any public utilities not previously metered separately from adjacent property of Tenant and a reasonable allowance for Landlord’s administrative efforts, salaries and overhead attributable directly or indirectly to Tenant’s default and Landlord’s pursuing the rights and remedies provided herein and under applicable law.

^^**Waiver**. If this Lease is terminated pursuant to law or the provisions of Section 14.2, Tenant waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any right of redemption, reentry or repossession and (b) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force exempting property from liability for rent or for debt.

^^**Application of Funds**. All payments otherwise payable to Tenant which are received by Landlord under any of the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of any Event of Default shall be applied to Tenant’s obligations in the order which Landlord may reasonably determine or as may be prescribed by the laws of the state in which the Premises are located.

During such period of tenancy, Tenant and Landlord shall be obligated to perform and observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease and to continue its occupancy and use of the Premises.

Notwithstanding the existence of any insurance provided for in Article 11, and without regard to the policy limits of any such insurance, Tenant will protect, indemnify, save harmless and defend Landlord and its partners, officers, agents and employees, and Landlord’s Mortgagee from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), to the extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Landlord by reason of: (a) any accident, injury to or death of persons or loss to property occurring on or about the Premises, including any claims of malpractice, (b) any use, misuse, no use, condition, maintenance or repair by Tenant of the Premises, (c) any Impositions which are the obligations of Tenant to pay pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Lease, (d) any failure on the part of Tenant to perform or comply with any of the terms of this Lease, (e) the non-performance of any of the terms and provisions of any and all existing and future subleases of the Premises to be performed by Tenant as landlord thereunder and (f) the violation of any Hazardous Materials Law occurring during the Lease Term, but excluding any period of time during which Landlord has re-entered and repossessed the Premises after Tenant’s abandonment thereof or otherwise caused by Landlord. Any amounts which become payable by Tenant under this Section 19.1 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after liability therefore on the part of Landlord is finally determined by litigation or otherwise (including the expiration of any time for appeals) and, if not timely paid, shall bear interest (to the extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate from the date of such determination to the date of payment. Tenant, at its expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted against Landlord and its partners, officers, agents and employees, and Landlord’s Mortgagee or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as reasonably acceptable to Landlord. Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant in a reasonable manner to permit Tenant to satisfy Tenant’s obligations hereunder, including the execution of any instruments or documents reasonably requested by Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Landlord or its agents for their own negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct.

^^**Landlord’s Indemnity**. Landlord will protect, indemnify, save harmless and defend Tenant and the members of Tenant and its partners, officers, agents and employees from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), to the extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Tenant by reason of: (a) any items excluded from the definition of “Impositions” pursuant to Article 34 hereof, (b) any failure on the part of Landlord to perform or comply with any of the terms of this Lease or the Ground Lease; and (c) the violation of any Hazardous Materials Law during any period of time during which Landlord has re-entered and repossessed the Premises after Tenant’s abandonment thereof or otherwise caused by Landlord. Any amounts which become payable by Landlord under this Section 19.2 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after liability therefore on the part of Tenant is finally determined by litigation or otherwise (including the expiration of any time for appeals) and, if not timely paid, shall bear interest (to the extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate from the date of such determination to the date of payment. Landlord, at its expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted against Tenant and its partners, officers, agents and employees, or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as reasonable acceptable to Tenant. Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in a reasonable manner to permit Landlord to satisfy Landlord’s obligations hereunder, including the execution of any instruments or documents reasonably requested by Landlord. Nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Tenant or its agents for their own negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct. Landlord’s liability for a breach of the provisions of this Section 19.2 shall survive any termination of this Lease.

\centered **SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNMENT**

^^**Assignment**. Except as expressly permitted under Section 20.3 hereof, Tenant shall not do any of the following without the prior written consent of Landlord, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed: (i) assign, either directly or indirectly (including an assignment of Tenant’s rights hereunder occurring by merger, conversion, whether occurring directly or indirectly, or by other operation of law) or delegate all or any portion of Tenant’s rights or obligations under or in respect to the leasehold estate created under this Lease, and/or (ii) permit the use of all or any part of the Premises by any persons other than Tenant or its Affiliates. In no event shall any assignee or subtenant use the Premises for any purpose other than a Permitted Use without Landlord’s consent, and in no event may Premises be used for a Prohibited Use. In the event Tenant desires to make an assignment, Tenant shall deliver prior written notice thereof and thereafter Landlord shall provide Tenant with written information or any prohibited or limited uses of the Premises to any assignee or sublessee. Tenant acknowledges that making any assignment without Landlord’s prior written consent shall be void, and if Tenant makes any assignment without such consent, Landlord shall have the right (but not the obligation) at anytime to declare an Event of Default hereunder. Except as to a Permitted Assignment set forth in Sections 20.3 or 20.4 hereof, Landlord may require, as a condition precedent to consenting to any assignment, that (a) the assignee establishes to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction such assignee’s financial ability to consistently perform the terms and obligations of this Lease, (b) the assignee shall assume in writing and agree to keep and perform all of the terms of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be kept and performed and shall be and become jointly and severally liable with Tenant for the performance thereof, (c) an original counterpart of each such assignment and assumption, duly executed by Tenant and such assignee shall be delivered promptly to Landlord, and (d) Tenant shall remain primarily liable, as principal rather than as surety, for the prompt payment of the Rent and for the performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant hereunder. In the event Tenant desires to make a assignment which requires Landlord’s consent, Landlord’s consent shall not be unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld, conditioned or delayed.

^^**Non-Disturbance, Subordination and Attornment**. Tenant shall insert in each sublease permitted hereunder provisions to the effect that (a) such sublease is subject and subordinate to all of the terms and provisions of this Lease and to the rights of Landlord hereunder, (b) in the event this Lease shall terminate before the expiration of such sublease, the subtenant thereunder will, at Landlord’s option, attorn to Landlord and waive any right the subtenant may have to terminate the sublease or to surrender possession thereunder as a result of the termination of this Lease and (c) in the event the subtenant receives a written notice from Landlord or Landlord’s assignees, if any, stating that Tenant is in default under this Lease, the subtenant shall thereafter be obligated to pay all rentals accruing under said sublease directly to the party giving such notice, or as such party may direct. All rentals received from the subtenant by Landlord or Landlord’s assignees, if any, as the case may be, shall be credited against amounts owing by Tenant under this Lease. Landlord agrees that notwithstanding any default, termination, expiration, sale, entry or other act or omission of Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, or at law or in equity, any subtenant’s possession shall not be disturbed unless such possession may otherwise be terminated pursuant to the terms of the applicable sublease. Landlord hereby agrees, upon Tenant’s request, to execute a nondisturbance agreement in favor of any subtenant under any sublease permitted under Section 20.1 above; provided that any such subtenant has acknowledged all of the foregoing provisions and executed all documents required by this Section 20.2.

^^**Permitted Subleases; Permitted Assignment to a Permitted Transferee**. Tenant may sublease all or any portion of the Premises without Landlord’s consent so long as (a) the subtenant agrees in writing to comply with the provisions of Section 20.2 and to be subject to and comply with all of the terms of this Lease, (b) an original counterpart of each such sublease, duly executed by Tenant and such subtenant shall be delivered promptly to Landlord and (c) Tenant shall remain primarily liable, as principal rather than as surety, for the prompt payment of the Rent and for the performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant hereunder. Any such subtenant shall be a “**Permitted Transferee**” for purposes hereof. In addition, Tenant may either directly or indirectly assign this Lease, whether occurring by actual assignment of interests, merger, conversion, or other operation of law, Transfer of membership or partnership interests in Tenant or Transfer of any shares, membership interest, partnership interest, or ownership interest in the legal entity owning the membership or partnership interests in Tenant, to any person or entity, to the extent allowed pursuant to those requirements set forth in Section 20.4 hereof. Any such assignee shall also be a “**Permitted Transferee**” for purposes hereof. Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of any change in its ownership structure, the Transfer of shares or ownership interest in the legal entity owning any partnership or membership interests in Tenant or assignment of this Lease to a Permitted Transferee and shall provide to Landlord all reasonably requested documentation relating to any such Transfer.

^^**Permitted Assignment by Tenant to Third Parties**. Any direct or indirect assignment of any ownership interest in Tenant, whether occurring by actual assignment of interests, merger, conversion or other operation of law, to any party shall require Landlord’s written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord shall not withhold such consent if, in Landlord’s commercially reasonable opinion, (i) the proposed transferee (including such transferee’s direct and indirect equity owners) has equal or better financial strength and capability as Tenant and (ii) the proposed transferee has operating experience and capability comparable to Tenant. The transferee of any Assignment permitted pursuant to this Section 20.4 shall be a “**Permitted Transferee**” for purposes hereof.

At least thirty (30) days prior to the occurrence of any Assignment, merger, conversion or other similar event (collectively, an “O**ther** E**ve****nt**”), Tenant shall deliver to Landlord notice of such proposed Assignment or other event, together with information concerning the anticipated date for closing of the Assignment or other event and the proposed assignee’s Financial Statements for the then current (in unaudited form if mid-fiscal year for such assignee) and the two (2) prior fiscal years. Within fifteen (15) days after delivery to Landlord of a request for Assignment or other event, Landlord shall advise Tenant whether any additional information is required. Landlord shall provide such consent or reason for withholding consent within thirty (30) days after delivery to Landlord of notice of such Assignment or other event and such reasonably requested financial information for assignee. Landlord’s failure to provide such consent or reason for withholding consent within such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed approval. In the event Tenant desires to make a sublease or assignment of the Lease, or assignment of the ownership interest in Tenant, and Landlord’s consent is required hereby, Landlord’s consent shall not be unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld, conditioned or delayed.

\centered **ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

Any such certificate furnished pursuant to this Article maybe relied upon by Landlord, Landlord’s Mortgagee and any prospective purchaser of the Building.

^^Within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each of Tenant’s fiscal years, Tenant will furnish or cause to furnish to Landlord a copy of the Financial Statements for the preceding fiscal year of Tenant, to the extent that such financial statements are prepared and available; provided that Tenant shall not be obligated to provide such information to Landlord it deems confidential and sensitive in its reasonable discretion. Landlord shall keep confidential all non-public information designated in writing by Tenant as confidential and shall not share such information with any third parties (except (1) to Landlord’s attorneys, consultants, accountants, lenders or prospective purchasers of Landlord’s interest in the project, (2) in litigation between Landlord and Tenant, and (3) if required by court order, without the written consent of Tenant.

No failure by Landlord to comply with the foregoing covenant shall give Tenant any right to cancel or terminate this Lease, or to fail to pay any other sum payable under this Lease, or to fail to perform any other obligation of Tenant hereunder.

The time within which Landlord shall be obligated to cure any such failure shall also be subject to extension of time due to the occurrence of any Force Majeure. In the event Landlord fails to cure any such default within the period provided, Tenant may seek such remedies available to Tenant hereunder or at law or in equity, but shall not have the right to terminate the Lease.

The subordination contained herein shall be memorialized by the execution and delivery of a written Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment Agreement by the applicable Landlord’s Mortgagee, and Tenant agrees to execute any such commercially reasonable form of Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment Agreement proposed by the applicable Landlord’s Mortgagee.

Except as expressly provided in this Lease by reason of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and as a condition to the subordination described in this Article 30 above or to Tenant’s obligation to execute any instruments as otherwise required under this Article 30 above, Tenant’s tenancy and Tenant’s rights under this Lease or any Easement shall not be disturbed, terminated or otherwise adversely affected, nor shall this Lease be affected, by the existence of, or any default under, any Landlord’s Mortgage, and in the event of a foreclosure or other enforcement of any Landlord’s Mortgage, or sale in lieu thereof, the purchaser at such foreclosure sale shall be bound to Tenant for the Term of this Lease and any Renewal Term, the rights of Tenant under this Lease shall expressly survive, and this Lease shall in all respects continue in full force and effect so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Tenant shall not be named as a party defendant in any such foreclosure suit, except as may be required by law.

In the event that the Project Architect is terminated for cause by Landlord, then any delays in the Premises Construction Schedule resulting from their termination, shall not be deemed a Landlord Delay under this Work Letter. Landlord’s contract with the Project Architect shall specify that Landlord shall have a License (as defined in Section 7.6 of this Work Letter) to use the Contract Documents (and any iteration thereof) even after removal of the Project Architect.

If Landlord and Tenant are unable to reach an agreement as to any terms for payment of the increase in costs as a result of Tenant Change Request, then Landlord may reject the Tenant change Request by written notice to Tenant.
