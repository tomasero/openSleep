The liability of the Parent Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

^^any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

^^any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

The obligations of the Parent Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Borrower or any other guarantor for any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Parent Guarantor whether or not action is brought against the Borrower or such other guarantor for any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and whether or not the Borrower or such other such guarantor are joined in any such action or actions.

SECTION 9. **Authorization**. The Administrative Agent and the Secured Creditors are hereby authorized, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of the Parent Guarantor hereunder, from time to time, to (i) renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise modify, amend or change (but only in accordance with the terms thereof) the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (other than this Guaranty Agreement), or any other promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument now or hereafter executed by the Borrower or the Parent Guarantor and delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Lender; (ii) accept partial payments on the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) take and hold security or collateral for the payment of this Guaranty Agreement, any other guarantees of the Guaranteed Obligations or other liabilities of the Borrower and the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby or thereby, and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (iv) apply such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in its discretion it may determine; and (v) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Guaranteed Obligations and any security or collateral therefor in any manner, without affecting or impairing the obligations of the Parent Guarantor hereunder.

No amendment or waiver of any provisions of this Guaranty Agreement nor consent to any departure by the Parent Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Parent Guarantor and the Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No release or termination of this Guaranty Agreement shall be effected unless the same shall be in writing and executed by the Parent Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 11. **No Waiver; Remedies**. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

SECTION 12. **Right of Set-off**. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Parent Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of the Parent Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under this Guaranty Agreement and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. The Administrative Agent agrees promptly to notify the Parent Guarantor after any such set-off and application made by the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), subject to the limitations set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent may assign or otherwise transfer its role as Administrative Agent to any other person or entity in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and such other person or entity shall thereupon become vested with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the Administrative Agent herein or otherwise.
