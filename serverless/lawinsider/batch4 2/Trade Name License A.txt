**WHEREAS,** Licensee acknowledges that Licensor is the owner of the trade name MedQuist (the “Name”) used to identify Licensor’s corporate entity and certain of its products and services; 

**WHEREAS,** Licensee desires to use the Name to identify Licensee’s corporate entity in connection with Licensee becoming a publicly-traded company in the United States, to identify the corporate entities which are subsidiaries of Licensee and to identify products and services of Licensee and its subsidiaries other than Licensor; and 

**WHEREAS**, Licensor and Licensee believe that such use of the Name by Licensee will be of mutual benefit. 

**NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 

^**Grant of License.** Licensor hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable (other than to subsidiaries of Licensee for uses consistent with those described in this Section 1) limited license to use, reproduce and display the Name, including as trademarks, domain names or other source indicators, in connection with the naming of Licensee’s corporate entity and the corporate entities which are subsidiaries of the Licensee (other than the Licensor) and the conduct by Licensee and its subsidiaries (other than Licensor) of their respective businesses. 

^**Reservation of Rights.** Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Name, including but not limited to the right to use the Name in connection with its business as well as its current and future products and services.

Licensor shall have no right to obtain any trademark or trade name or, other than as expressly set forth herein, to obtain any other intellectual property rights in the Name. 

^**Term.** The term of the License shall be effective upon the Effective Date and shall continue unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 9. 

^**Non-exclusivity.** Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent Licensor from granting any other licenses for use of the Name or from utilizing the Name in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that no such license or use shall be granted to any person who is not a subsidiary of Licensee or Licensor without the approval of the Licensor’s board of directors.

^**Licensor’s Title and Protection of Licensor’s Rights.** 

^^Licensee agrees that it will not, during the term of this Agreement, or thereafter, challenge the title or any rights of Licensor in and to the Name or challenge the validity of the license granted herein or any trademarks or trademark registrations relating to the Name. 

^^Licensee agrees to assist Licensor to the extent necessary in the procurement of any protection or to protect any of Licensor’s right to the Name, and Licensor, if it so desires and at its own expense, may commence or prosecute any claims or suits in its own name or in the name of Licensee or join Licensee as a party thereto. Licensee shall notify Licensor in writing of any infringement or imitations by others of the Name which come to Licensee’s attention, and Licensor shall have the sole right to determine whether or not any action shall be taken on account of any such infringements or imitations. Licensee shall not institute any suit or take any action on account of any such infringement without prior consultation with Licensor.

Licensee hereby agrees that at the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Licensee will be deemed to have assigned, transferred and conveyed to Licensor any trade rights, equities, goodwill, titles or other rights in and to the Name which may have been obtained by Licensee or which may have vested in Licensee, and that Licensee will execute any instruments requested by Licensor to accomplish or confirm the foregoing. Any such assignment, transfer or conveyance shall be without consideration other than the mutual covenants and considerations of this Agreement. 

^**Indemnification.** Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor, its directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages (including but not limited to damage to the value of the Name or the Licensor’s goodwill in the Name) and expenses (including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) that any of them may incur or become obligated or liable to pay as a result of Licensee’s breach of this Agreement or Licensee’s use of the Name. In any instance to which the foregoing indemnities pertain to a third party claim, Licensor shall cooperate with and assist Licensee in connection with any such defense, Licensee shall reimburse Licensor’s reasonable out-of-pocket costs actually incurred by Licensor in connection with such cooperation and assistance, and Licensee shall keep Licensor fully advised of all developments and shall not enter into a settlement or admit liability or fault without Licensor’s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that Licensor may elect to assume the defense of any such third-party claim at Licensee’s expense, and Licensee shall reimburse Licensor’s reasonable out-of-pocket costs actually incurred by Licensor in connection with such defense, but Licensor shall not enter into a settlement or admit liability or fault without Licensee’s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
