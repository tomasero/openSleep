The [[Organization 1 Name]] will pay interest semi-annually on [[Date 4]] and [[Date 5]] of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an “***Interest Payment Date***”). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; *provided* that if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest will accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; *provided, further*, that the first Interest Payment Date will be [[Date 8: Date]]. The [[Organization 1 Name]] will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at the rate equal to the then applicable interest rate on the Notes to the extent lawful; it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes, voting as a single class, and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes, voting as a single class. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; (iii) to provide for the assumption of the [[Organization 1 Name]]’s obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the [[Organization 1 Name]]’s assets; (iv) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Supplemental Indenture of any such Holder; (v) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Supplemental Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; (vi) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Supplemental Indenture; or (vii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee.

^*DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES.* An “EVENT OF DEFAULT” occurs if: (i) there is a default for a period of 90 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (ii) there is a default in the payment when due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes; (iii) the [[Organization 1 Name]] fails for 90 days after notice to the [[Organization 1 Name]] to comply with any covenant or warranty of the [[Organization 1 Name]] in the Indenture; or (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency occur with respect to the [[Organization 1 Name]].

If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least [[Percentage 6: Number]]% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the [[Organization 1 Name]], all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The [[Organization 1 Name]] is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the [[Organization 1 Name]] is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

^*TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH [[Organization 1 Name]]*. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the [[Organization 1 Name]] or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the [[Organization 1 Name]] or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

^*NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS*. A director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, of the [[Organization 1 Name]], as such, will not have any liability for any obligations of the [[Organization 1 Name]]

under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.
