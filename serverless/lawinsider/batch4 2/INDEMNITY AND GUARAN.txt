This is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection. The liability of Indemnitor under this Agreement shall be direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against Borrower or any other person (including, without limitation, other guarantors, if any), nor against the collateral for the Loan. Indemnitor waives any right to require that an action be brought against Borrower or any other person or to require that resort be made to any collateral for the Loan or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of Lender in favor of Borrower or any other person. In the event, on account of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, or any other debtor relief law (whether statutory, common law, case law or otherwise) of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect, which may be or become applicable, Borrower shall be relieved of or fail to incur any Costs as provided in the Loan Documents, Iridemnitor shall nevertheless be fully liable for such Costs. In the event of a default under the Loan Documents which is not cured within any applicable grace or cure period, Lender shall have the right to enforce its rights, powers and remedies (including, without limitation, foreclosure of all or any portion of the collateral for the Loan) thereunder or hereunder, in any order, and all rights, powers and remedies available to Lender in such event shall be non-exclusive and cumulative of all other rights, powers and remedies provided thereunder or hereunder or by law or in equity. If the indebtedness and obligations guaranteed hereby are partially paid or discharged by reason of the exercise of any of the remedies available to Lender, this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and Indemnitor shall remain liable for all remaining indebtedness and obligations guaranteed hereby, even though any rights which Indemnitor may have against Borrower may be destroyed or diminished by the exercise of any such remedy. 

^Indemnification Procedures. 

^^If any action shall be brought against Lender based upon any of the matters for 

which Lender is indemnified hereunder, Lender shall notify Indemnitor in writing thereof and Indemnitor shall promptly assume the defense thereof, including, without limitation, the employment of counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender and the negotiation of any settlement; provided, however, that any failure of Lender to notify Indemnitor of such matter shall not impair or reduce the obligations of Indemnitor hereunder. Lender shall have the right, at the expense of Indemnitor (which reasonable expense shall be included in Costs), to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof. In the event Indemnitor shall fail to discharge or undertake to defend Lender against any claim, loss or liability for which Lender is indemnified hereunder, 

Lender may, at its sole option and election, defend or settle such claim, loss or liability. The liability of Indemnitor to Lender hereunder shall be conclusively established by such settlement, provided such settlement is made in good faith, the amount of such liability to include both the settlement consideration and the reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred by Lender in effecting such settlement. In such event, such settlement consideration, costs and expenses shall be included in Costs and Indemnitor shall pay the same as hereinafter provided. Lender’s good faith in any such settlement shall be conclusively established if the settlement is made on the advice of independent legal counsel for Lender. 

^^Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender: (i) settle or 

compromise any action, suit, proceeding or claim against Lender or consent to the entry of any judgment against Lender that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to Lender of a full and complete written release of Lender (in form, scope and substance satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion) from all liability in respect of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and a dismissal with prejudice of such action, suit, proceeding or claim; or (ii) settle or compromise any action, suit, proceeding or claim against Lender in any manner that may adversely affect Lender or obligate Lender to pay any sum or perform any obligation as determined by Lender in its sole discretion. 

^^All Costs shall be immediately reimbursable to Lender when and as incurred 

and, in the event of any litigation, claim or other proceeding, without any requirement of waiting for the ultimate outcome of such litigation, claim or other proceeding, and Indemnitor shall pay to Lender any and all Costs within thirty (30) days after written notice from Lender itemizing the amounts thereof incurred to the date of such notice. In addition to any other remedy available for the failure of Indemnitor to periodically pay such Costs, such Costs, if not paid within said thirty-day period, shall bear interest at the Default Interest Rate (as defined in the Note). 

^Reinstatement of Obligations. If at any time all or any part of any payment made by 

Indemnitor or received by Lender from Indemnitor under or with respect to this Agreement is or must be rescinded or returned for any reason whatsoever (including, but not limited to, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Indemnitor or Borrower), then the obligations of Indemnitor hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence, notwithstanding such previous payment made by Indemnitor, or receipt of payment by Lender, and the obligations of Indemnitor hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, all as though such previous payment by Indemnitor had never been made. 

^Waivers by Indemnitor. To the extent permitted by law, Indemnitor hereby waives 

and agrees not to assert or take advantage of: 

^^Any right to require Lender to proceed against Borrower or any other 

person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Lender at any time or to pursue any other remedy in Lender’s power or under any other agreement before proceeding against Indemnitor hereunder; 

^^Intentionally Deleted; 

^^Any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, 

death or disability of any other person or persons or the failure of Lender to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any other person or persons; 

^^Demand, presentment for payment, notice of nonpayment, protest, notice 

of protest and all other notices of any kind (except as may be specifically required under this Agreement), or the lack of any thereof, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of Borrower, Lender, any endorser or creditor of Borrower or of Indemnitor or on the part of any other person whomsoever under this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by Lender; 

^^Any defense based upon an election of remedies by Lender; 

^^Any right or claim or right to cause a marshalling of the assets of 

Indemnitor; 

^^Intentionally Deleted; 

^^Any duty on the part of Lender to disclose to Indemnitor any facts Lender 

may now or hereafter know about Borrower or the Property, regardless of whether Lender has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the risk beyond that which Indemnitor intends to assume or has reason to believe that such facts are unknown to Indemnitor or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Indemnitor, it being understood and agreed that Indemnitor is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Borrower, of the condition of the Property and of any and all circumstances bearing on the risk that liability may be incurred by Indemnitor hereunder; 

^^Any lack of notice of disposition or of manner of disposition of any 

collateral for the Loan; 

^^Any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any 

one or more of the Loan Documents; 

^^Intentionally Deleted; 

^Any deficiencies in the collateral for the Loan or any deficiency in the 

ability of Lender to collect or to obtain performance from any persons or entities now or hereafter liable for the payment and performance of any obligation hereby guaranteed; 

^^An assertion or claim that the automatic stay provided by 11 U.S.C. §362 

(arising upon the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding of Borrower) or any other stay provided under *any* other debtor relief law (whether statutory, common law, case law or 

otherwise) of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect, which may be or become applicable, shall operate or be interpreted to stay, interdict, condition, reduce or inhibit the ability of Lender to enforce any of its rights, whether now or hereafter required, which Lender may have against Indemnitor or the collateral for the Loan; 

^^Any modifications of the Loan Documents or any obligation of Borrower 

relating to the Loan by operation of law or by action of any court, whether pursuant to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, or any other debtor relief law (whether statutory, common law, case law or otherwise) of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect, or otherwise; and 

^^Any action, occurrence, event or matter consented to by Indemnitor under 

Section 5(h) hereof, under any other provision hereof, or otherwise. 

^General Provisions. 

^^Fully Recourse. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement are 

recourse obligations of Indemnitor and not restricted by any limitation on personal liability. 

^^Unsecured Obligations. Indemnitor hereby acknowledges that Lender’s 

appraisal of the Property is such that Lender is not willing to accept the consequences of the inclusion of Indemnitor’s indemnity set forth herein among the obligations secured by the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents and that Lender would not make the Loan but for the unsecured personal liability undertaken by Indemnitor herein. 

^^Survival. This Agreement shall be deemed to be continuing in nature and 

shall remain in full force and effect and shall survive the exercise of any remedy by Lender under the Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof, even if, as a part of such remedy, the Loan is paid or satisfied in full. 

^^No Subrogation; No Recourse Against Lender. Notwithstanding the 

satisfaction by Indemnitor of any liability hereunder, Indemnitor shall not have any right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement or indemnity whatsoever or any right of recourse to or with respect to the assets or property of Borrower or to any collateral for the Loan. In connection with the foregoing, Indemnitor expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation to Lender against Borrower, and Indemnitor hereby waives any rights to enforce any remedy which Lender may have against Borrower and any right to participate in any collateral for the Loan. In addition to and without in any way limiting the foregoing, Indemnitor hereby subordinates any and all indebtedness of Borrower now or hereafter owed to Indemnitor to all indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, and agrees with Lender that Indemnitor shall not demand or accept any payment of principal or interest from Borrower, shall not claim any offset or other reduction of Indemnitor’s obligations hereunder because of any such indebtedness and shall not take any action to obtain any of the collateral from the Loan. Further, Indemnitor shall not have any right of recourse against Lender by reason of any action Lender may take or omit to take under the provisions of this Agreement or under the provisions of 

any of the Loan Documents, except for any action arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender. 

^^Reservation of Rights. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent or 

in any way diminish or interfere with any rights or remedies, including, without limitation, the right to contribution, which Lender may have against Borrower, Indemnitor or any other party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (codified at Title 42 U.S.C. §9601 et seq.), as it may be amended from time to time, or any other applicable federal, state or local laws, all such rights being hereby expressly reserved. 

Financial Statements. Indemnitor hereby agrees, as a material inducement to Lender to make the Loan to Borrower, to furnish to Lender promptly upon demand by Lender (but not more than once per calendar year unless Borrower defaults at any time under the Loan Documents) current and dated financial statements detailing the assets and liabilities of Indemnitor, certified by or on behalf of Indemnitor, in form and substance acceptable to Lender. Indemnitor hereby warrants and represents unto Lender that any and all balance sheets, net worth statements and other financial data which have heretofore been given or may hereafter be given to Lender with respect to Indemnitor did or will at the time of such delivery fairly and accurately present the financial condition of Indemnitor. 

^^Rights Cumulative; Payments. Lender’s rights under this Agreement shall be 

in addition to all rights of Lender under the Note, the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents. Further, payments made by Indemnitor under this Agreement (or any other indemnitor under separate agreement) shall not reduce in any respect Borrower’s obligations and liabilities under the Note, the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents. 

^^No Limitation on Liability. Indemnitor hereby consents and agrees that 

Lender may at any time and from time to time without further consent from Indemnitor do any of the following events, and the liability of Indemnitor under this Agreement shall be unconditional and absolute and shall in no way be impaired or limited by any of the following events, whether occurring with or without notice to Indemnitor or with or without consideration: (i) any extensions of time for performance required by any of the Loan Documents or extension or renewal of the Note; (ii) any sale, assignment or foreclosure of the Note, the Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents or any sale or transfer of the Property; (iii) any change in the composition of Borrower, including, without limitation, the withdrawal or removal of Indemnitor from any current or future position of ownership, management or control of Borrower; (iv) the accuracy or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties made by Indemnitor herein or by Borrower in any of the Loan Documents; (v) the release of Borrower or of any other person or entity from performance or observance of any of the agreements, covenants, terms or conditions contained in any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, Lender’s voluntary act or otherwise; (vi) the release or substitution in whole or in part of any security for the Loan; (vii) Lender’s failure to record the Deed of Trust or to file any financing statement (or Lender’s improper recording or filing thereof) or to otherwise perfect, protect, secure or insure any lien or security interest given as security for the Loan; (viii) the modification of the terms of any one or more of the Loan Documents; or (ix) the taking or failure to take any action of any type whatsoever required under the Loan Documents. No such action which 

Lender shall take or fail to take in connection with the Loan Documents or any collateral for the Loan, nor any course or dealing with Borrower or any other person, shall limit, impair or release Indemnitor’s obligations hereunder, affect this Agreement in any way or afford Indemnitor any recourse against Lender. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to require Lender to take or refrain from taking any action referred to herein. - 

^^Entire Agreement; Amendment; Severability. This Agreement contains the 

entire agreement between the parties respecting the matters herein set forth and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties respecting such matters. Any amendments or modifications hereto, in order to be effective, shall be in writing and executed by the parties hereto. A determination that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision, and any determination that the application of any provision of this Agreement to any person or circumstance is illegal or unenforceable shall not affect the enforceability or validity of such provision as it may apply to any other persons or circumstances.
