SECTION 2.01  Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

^^Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except as set forth in Section 2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $33.75 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). The Merger Consideration is payable in accordance with Section 2.02(b). 

^^Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

^^Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $[[USD Value 5]] per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $[[USD Value 5]] per share, of [[Organization 4 Name]]. 

SECTION 2.02  Exchange of Certificates. (a)  Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “ Paying Agent”), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause [[Organization 4 Name]] to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “ Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; *provided*, *however*, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $[[USD Value 4: Number]] billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to [[Organization 4 Name]]. 

^^Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares 

^^^^^ 
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates evidencing such Shares (the “Certificates”) or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (B) receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in the case of Book-Entry Shares, and, in each case, such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

^^No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law. 

^^Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to [[Organization 4 Name]], upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or [[Organization 4 Name]] for, and Parent and [[Organization 4 Name]] shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

^^No Liability. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or [[Organization 4 Name]] shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash (including any 

^^^^^ 
dividends or distributions with respect to such Shares) delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

^^Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, [[Organization 4 Name]] and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state or local Tax Laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, [[Organization 4 Name]] or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, [[Organization 4 Name]] or Parent, as the case may be. 

^^Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if required by [[Organization 4 Name]], the posting by such person of an indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to [[Organization 4 Name]], the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

SECTION 2.03  Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

SECTION 2.04  Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock. (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action (which action shall be effective as of the Effective Time), to (i) terminate [[Organization 3 Name]] Equity Incentive Plan, [[Organization 3 Name]] Outside Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan and the 2010 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (collectively, the “ Company Stock Plans”), (ii) provide that each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a “ Company Stock Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, (iii) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised, as of the Effective Time (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to the payment pursuant to Section 2.04(b) and (iv) provide that each share of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and transferable and that all restrictions on such 

^^^^^ 
restricted Company Common Stock shall lapse as of the Effective Time and accordingly will be eligible to receive the per share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

^^Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per Share that is less than the per share Merger Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this Section 2.04) be paid by [[Organization 4 Name]] promptly after the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the difference between the per share Merger Consideration and the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares that remain issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option. Any such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements. In the event that the exercise price per share of a Company Stock Option is greater than or equal to the per share Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without consideration and have no further force or effect. 

^^Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each person who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended. 

SECTION 2.05  Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for such Shares (the “ Dissenting Shares”) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (“ Section 262”) shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Any such stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such stockholder’s Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262; *provided*, *however*, that all Dissenting Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholder’s rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.02 of any Certificate or the Book-Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares. 

^^The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

The term “ Company Material Adverse Effect” means (i) any event, circumstance, state of facts, change or effect that is materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) any event, circumstance, state of facts, change or effect that would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement; *provided*, *however*, that in no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect (except, in the case of clauses (A)(1), (A)(2) or (A)(4) below, to the extent any of the matters referred to therein has had or would reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other for-profit and comparable or similar companies operating in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, after taking into account the size of the Company relative to such other for-profit companies): (A) any event, circumstance, state of facts, change or effect resulting from or relating to (1) a change in general economic, political or financial market conditions, including interest or exchange rates, (2) a change generally affecting the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate (including seasonal fluctuations) or general economic conditions that generally affect the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct their business, (3) any change in accounting requirements

^^A true and complete list of all the Subsidiaries of the Company, together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of each such Subsidiary owned by the Company, each other Subsidiary of the Company and any other person, is set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any material equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than the Subsidiaries of the Company). 

SECTION 3.02  Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws (or similar organizational documents), each as amended to date, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Such Certificates of Incorporation and By-Laws or similar organizational documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or similar organizational documents, except, in the case of any Subsidiary of the Company, for violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

None of the information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company’s stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

^^^^^ 
^Absence of Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of the officers of Parent, threatened in writing, against Parent or any of its affiliates before any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their obligations hereunder. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, any Governmental Authority, or any order, judgment, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their obligations hereunder.

SECTION 4.08  Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of an executed commitment letter, including excerpts of those portions of each fee letter and engagement letter associated therewith that contain any conditions to funding or “flex” provisions or other substantive provisions (excluding only those provisions related solely to fees and economic terms agreed to by the parties) regarding the terms and conditions of the financing to be provided thereby (together, the “ Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which [[Organization 6 Name]] has committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with financing in an aggregate amount of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] million. The Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent as of the date of this Agreement, the other parties thereto. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under the Commitment Letter. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof. Parent shall have at the Closing and at the Effective Time immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses associated therewith. The financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter is subject to no contingency or conditions other than those set forth in the copies of the Commitment Letter delivered to the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that such financing will not be available to Merger Sub on the date of the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing for Parent to obtain any financing. 

SECTION 4.09  Brokers. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage, finder’s or other fee or commission to any broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. The parties to this Agreement will provide each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; *provided, however*, that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns.

^^When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement. The term “or” is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. 

SECTION 9.04  Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

SECTION 9.05  Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or warranty relating to such party or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement. 

SECTION 9.06  Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their 

^^^^^ 
rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; *provided, however*, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. 

SECTION 9.07  Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.04 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons) and except for the right of (i) the Company, on behalf of the holders of equity interests in the Company, to pursue damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include claims for damages based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the stockholders of the Company and other relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of holders of equity interests in the Company, in the event of a failure by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger as required by this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub and (ii) Parent to pursue damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include claims for damages based on the synergies and other benefits that would have otherwise accrued to Parent and other relevant matters), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of holders of equity interests in Parent, in the event of a failure by the Company to consummate the Merger as required by this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, any action of the Special Committee shall be binding upon and shall constitute an act of the Company. 

SECTION 9.08  Remedies; Specific Performance; Expenses. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which each party may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary damages), such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or other undertaking. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Expenses of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub incurred in connection with any Action brought by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub relating to the terms and provisions of this Agreement provided for in the foregoing sentence shall be paid by the Company in the event that Parent is successful on the merits in such Action and shall be paid by Parent in the event that the Company is successful on the merits in such Action. 

SECTION 9.09  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or any 

^^^^^ 
proper appellate court thereof). The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the courts described above, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by the courts described above. 

SECTION 9.10  Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.10. 

SECTION 9.11  Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; *provided*, *however*, that, after the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made except as allowed under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

SECTION 9.12  Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

SECTION 9.13  Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

SECTION 9.14  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
