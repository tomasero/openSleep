Re: [[Organization 2 Name]] (“SCLW”)

Dear Jonathan:

As per our earlier discussions I am writing to confirm the agreement between SCLW and Equity Source Partners (“ESP”) regarding ESP’s introduction of [[Organization 3 Name]] (“Maxim”) to SCLW, regarding the current financing.

We have agreed that should the introduction to Maxim result in an actual investment into SCLW, SCLW will pay ESP a fee equal to a maximum of 300,000 warrants as follows:

^^,000 total warrants should Maxim deliver $[[USD Value 1: Number]] in gross proceeds;

^^,000 total warrants should Maxim deliver $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in gross proceeds;

^^,000 total warrants should Maxim deliver $[[USD Value 3: Number]] in gross proceeds;

Should Maxim deliver more than $[[USD Value 3]] in proceeds then ESP and SCLW will negotiate in good faith regarding additional warrants.

The warrants paid to ESP will be identical to the warrants paid to Maxim as compensation for their efforts.

Your signature below indicates your agreement to these terms.

Best regards,

Agreed to:
