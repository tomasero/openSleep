The Penn Millers Stock Incentive Plan, effective as of [[Date 1: Date]], is intended to provide selected employees and non-employee directors of [[Organization 1 Name]] (the “Corporation”) and its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) with an opportunity to acquire Common Stock of the Corporation. The Plan is designed to help the Corporation attract, retain, and motivate employees and non-employee directors to make substantial contributions to the success of the Corporation’s business and the businesses of its Subsidiaries. Awards made under the Plan are based upon, among other things, a participant’s level of responsibility and performance within the Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

^^^^^ 
^^^under the terms of the agreement providing for such merger, consolidation, or reorganization, the individuals who were members of the Board immediately prior to the execution of such agreement will constitute at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation after such merger, consolidation, or reorganization; and 

^^^based on the terms of the agreement providing for such merger, consolidation, or reorganization, no Person (other than (A) the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation, (B) any Benefit Plan, (C) the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, or (D) any Person who, immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, or reorganization had beneficial ownership of [[Percentage 1]]% or more of the then outstanding voting securities) will have beneficial ownership of [[Percentage 1]]% or more of the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation’s then outstanding voting securities;

^^[Reserved.]  

^^^^^ 
^^If any Option is exercised by tendering Common Stock, either actually or by attestation, to the Corporation as full or partial payment in connection with the exercise of such Option under the Plan, or if the tax withholding requirements are satisfied through such tender, only the number of shares of Common Stock issued net of the Common Stock tendered shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares available for Awards under the Plan. 

^^The number of shares of Common Stock for which Awards may be made under the Plan shall automatically increase on the first trading day of January of each calendar year during the term of the Plan, beginning with calendar year 2010, by an amount equal to one percent of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last trading day in December of the immediately preceding calendar year. Awards from shares of Common Stock available under the Plan as a result of the operation of this Section 4.1(f) may be awarded as either Nonqualified Stock Options, Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units (but not as Incentive Stock Options), subject to the limitations of Sections 4.1(b), (c), and (d). 

^^Shares Available. The Common Stock to be issued under the Plan shall be the Corporation’s Common Stock, which shall be made available at the discretion of the Board, either from authorized but unissued Common Stock, treasury shares, or shares acquired by the Corporation, including shares purchased on the open market. In the event that any outstanding Award under the Plan for any reason expires, terminates, or is forfeited, the shares of Common Stock allocable to such expiration, termination, or forfeiture may thereafter again be made subject to an Award under the Plan. 

ARTICLE 5. ELIGIBILITY  
^^Participation. Awards shall be made by the Committee only to persons who are Employees or Non-Employee Directors. 

^^Incentive Stock Option Eligibility. Incentive Stock Option Awards may only be made to Employees of the Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, an individual who owns more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock of the Corporation shall not be eligible for the award of an Incentive Stock Option, unless the special requirements set forth in Sections 6.1 and 7.1 are satisfied. For purposes of this section, in determining stock ownership, an individual shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for his brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by or for its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries. “Outstanding stock” shall include all stock actually issued and outstanding immediately before the award of the Option. “Outstanding stock” shall not include shares authorized for issue under outstanding Options held by the Optionee or by any other person. 

^^^^^ 
^STOCK OPTIONS IN GENERAL  
^^Exercise Price. The exercise price of an Option to purchase a share of Common Stock shall be, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, not less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Option is awarded, except that the exercise price shall be not less than [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of such fair market value in the case of an Incentive Stock Option awarded to any individual described in the second sentence of Section 5.2. The exercise price of an Option to purchase a share of Common Stock shall be, in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option, not less than [[Percentage 3]]% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Option is awarded. The exercise price shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the limited circumstances set forth in Article 11. 

^^Limitation on Incentive Stock Options. The aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date an Option is awarded) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any individual in any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans maintained by the Corporation and Subsidiaries) shall not exceed $[[USD Value 1: Number]] 

^^Determination of Fair Market Value.  
^^If the Common Stock is not listed on an established stock exchange or exchanges but is listed on Nasdaq, the fair market value per share shall be the closing sale price for the Common Stock on the relevant day. If no sale of Common Stock has occurred on that day, the fair market value shall be determined by reference to such price for the next preceding day on which a sale occurred. 

^^If the Common Stock is not listed on an established stock exchange or on Nasdaq, fair market value per share shall be the mean between the closing dealer “bid” and “asked” prices for the Common Stock for the day an Option is awarded, and if no “bid” and “asked” prices are quoted for the day an Option is awarded, the fair market value shall be determined by reference to such prices on the next preceding day on which such prices were quoted. 

^^If the Common Stock is listed on an established stock exchange or exchanges, the fair market value shall be deemed to be the closing price of Common Stock on such stock exchange or exchanges on the day an Option is awarded. If no sale of Common Stock has been made on any stock exchange on that day, the fair market value shall be determined by reference to such price for the next preceding day on which a sale occurred. 

^^In the event that the Common Stock is not traded on an established stock exchange or on Nasdaq, and no closing dealer “bid” and “asked” prices are available on the day an Option is awarded, then fair market value will be the price established by the Committee in good faith through the reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method and as required by Code Section 409A. 

In connection with determining the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on any relevant day, the Committee may use any source deemed reliable; and its determination shall be final and binding on all affected persons, absent clear error. 

^^Limitation on Option Awards. Stock Option Awards under this Plan (and any other plan of the Corporation or a Subsidiary providing for stock option awards) to any individual shall not exceed, in the aggregate, Options to acquire [[Shares 4: Number]] shares of Common Stock during any period of 12 consecutive months. Such limitation shall be subject to adjustment in the manner described in Article 11. 

^^^^^ 
^^Transferability of Options.  
^^Except as provided in Subsection (b), an Option awarded hereunder shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and such Option shall be exercisable, during the Optionee’s lifetime, only by him or her. 

^^An Optionee may, with the prior approval of the Committee, transfer a Nonqualified Stock Option for no consideration to or for the benefit of one or more members of the Optionee’s “immediate family” (including a trust, partnership, or limited liability company for the benefit of one or more of such members), subject to such limits as the Committee may impose, and the transferee shall remain subject to all terms and conditions applicable to the Option prior to its transfer. The term “immediate family” shall mean an Optionee’s spouse, parents, children, stepchildren, adoptive relationships, sisters, brothers, and grandchildren (and, for this purpose, shall also include the Optionee). 

ARTICLE 7. TERM, VESTING AND EXERCISE OF OPTIONS 

^^Term and Vesting. Each Option awarded under the Plan shall terminate on the date determined by the Committee, and specified in the Agreement; provided, however, that (i) each intended Incentive Stock Option awarded to an individual described in the second sentence of Section 5.2 shall terminate not later than five years after the date of the Award, (ii) each other intended Incentive Stock Option shall terminate not later than ten years after the date of the Award, and (iii) each Option awarded under the Plan which is intended to be a Nonqualified Stock Option shall terminate not later than ten years and one month after the date of the Award. Each Option awarded under the Plan shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may be provided by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement issued to a Optionee to evidence such Option; provided, however, that, unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in an applicable Agreement, each Option shall be fully exercisable (i.e., become [[Percentage 3]]% vested) after the earlier of the date on which, (i) a Change in Control occurs or (ii) the Optionee terminates employment or service by reason of death or Disability). Except as provided in Article 8, an Option may be exercised only during the continuance of the Optionee’s employment or service with the Corporation or a Subsidiary. 

^^Exercise.  
^^A person electing to exercise an Option shall give notice to the Corporation of such election and of the number of shares he or she has elected to purchase and shall at the time of exercise tender the full exercise price of the shares he or she has elected to purchase. The exercise notice shall be delivered to the Corporation in person, by certified mail, or by such other method (including electronic transmission) and in such form as determined by the Committee. The exercise price shall be paid in full, in cash, upon the exercise of the Option; provided, however, that in lieu of cash, with the approval of the Committee at or prior to exercise, an Optionee may exercise an Option by tendering to the Corporation shares of Common Stock owned by him or her and having a fair market value equal to the cash exercise price applicable to the Option (with the fair market value of such stock to be determined in the manner provided in Section 6.3) or by delivering such combination of cash and such shares as the Committee in its sole discretion may approve; further provided, however, that no such manner of exercise shall be 

^^^^^ 
permitted if such exercise would violate Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option may not be tendered as payment unless the holding period requirements of Code Section 422(a)(1) have been satisfied, and Common Stock not acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option may not be tendered as payment unless it has been held, beneficially and of record, for at least six months (or such longer time as may be required by applicable securities law or accounting principles to avoid adverse consequences to the Corporation or a Participant). 

^^At the request of the Participant and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, selectively approve an arrangement whereby the Participant irrevocably authorizes a third party to sell shares of Common Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon the exercise of an Option and to remit to the Corporation a sufficient portion of the sales proceeds to pay the entire exercise price and any tax withholding required as a result of such exercise. 

^^At the request of the Participant and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, selectively approve a “net exercise” arrangement whereby the Corporation will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option by the largest whole number of shares of Common Stock with a fair market value that does not exceed the exercise price of the Option; provided, however, that the Optionee provide cash to the Corporation to the extent of any remaining balance of the exercise price. Shares of Common Stock will no longer be subject to such Option and such Option will no longer be exercisable thereafter to the extent of the number of shares used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the net exercise, the number of shares delivered to the Optionee as a result of such net exercise and the number of shares, if any withheld to satisfy any tax withholding obligations. 

^^A person holding more than one Option at any relevant time may, in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, elect to exercise such Options in any order. 

ARTICLE 8. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS FOLLOWING TERMINATION

OF EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE 

^^Other Termination by Corporation or Subsidiary; Change in Control. In the event of an Optionee’s termination of employment or service (i) by the Corporation or a Subsidiary other than Termination for Cause or (ii) due to a Change in Control, such Optionee’s Option shall lapse at the earlier of the expiration of the term of such Option or: 

^^in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, three months from the date of such termination of employment; and 

^^in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option, 12 months from the date of such termination of employment or service. 

^^Death or Total Disability. In the event of an Optionee’s termination of employment or service by reason of death or Disability, such Optionee’s Option shall lapse at the earlier of the expiration of the term of such Option or:

^^in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option, 12 months from the date of such termination of employment or service. 

^^Termination or Dismissal For Cause; Other Termination by Optionee. In the event of an Optionee’s Termination or Dismissal For Cause, or in the event of termination of employment at the election of an Optionee, such Optionee’s Option shall lapse upon such termination. 

^^Special Termination Provisions for Options. 

^^In the event that an Optionee’s employment or service is terminated and the Committee deems it equitable to do so, the Committee may, in its discretion and subject to the approval of a majority of the disinterested members of the Board, waive any continuous service requirement for vesting (but not any Performance Goal or Goals) specified in an applicable Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 and permit exercise of an Option held by such Optionee prior to the satisfaction of such continuous service requirement. Any such waiver may be made with retroactive effect, provided it is made within 60 days following the Optionee’s termination of employment or service. 

^^In the event the Committee waives the continuous service requirement with respect to an Option as set forth in Section 8.4(a) above and the circumstance of an Optionee’s termination of employment or service is described in Section 8.1, the affected Option will lapse as otherwise provided in the relevant section. 

^^In the event the Committee waives the continuous service requirement with respect to an Option as set forth in Section 8.4(a) above, such Option shall lapse at the earlier of the expiration of the term of such Option or: 

^^^in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, three months from the date of termination of employment; and

^^Waiver of Vesting Period for Certain Restricted Stock Awards.

Any such waiver may be made with retroactive effect, provided it is made within 60 days following such Participant’s termination of employment or service. 

^^Issuance and Retention of Share Certificates By Corporation. One or more share certificates shall be issued upon the award of Restricted Stock; but until such time as the Restricted Stock shall vest or otherwise become distributable by reason of satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals, the Corporation shall retain such share certificates. 

^^Stock Powers. At the time of the award of Restricted Stock, the Participant to whom the award is made shall deliver such stock powers, endorsed in blank, as may be requested by the Corporation. 

^^Release of Shares. Within 30 days following the date on which a Participant becomes entitled under an Agreement to receive shares of previously Restricted Stock, the Corporation shall deliver to him or her a certificate evidencing the ownership of such shares. 

^^Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Awards. In the event of the forfeiture of a Restricted Stock Award, by reason of a Participant’s termination of employment or termination of service (including termination of service as a director emeritus) prior to vesting, the failure to achieve a Performance Goal or otherwise, the Corporation shall take such steps as may be necessary to cancel the affected shares and return the same to its treasury. 

^^Assignment, Transfer, Etc. of Restricted Stock Rights.

[[Shares 5: Number]] Shareholder Rights. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in an applicable Agreement, Participants who have been awarded shares of Restricted Stock shall not have voting or dividend rights until such time as the Participant receives unrestricted certificates for such shares.
