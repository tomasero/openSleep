Principal Amount, Purchase Price and Fundamental Change Purchase Price and accrued and unpaid interest, Special Interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, shall be considered paid on the applicable date due if by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with this Indenture, cash or securities, if permitted hereunder, sufficient to pay all such amounts then due. The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, pay interest on overdue principal and overdue installments of interest, Special Interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, at the rate borne by the Notes per annum plus [[Percentage 2: Number]]%.

If at any time Additional Interest becomes payable by the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Trustee a certificate to that effect and stating (i) the amount of such Additional Interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such Additional Interest is payable pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such a certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Additional Interest is payable. If the Company has paid Additional Interest directly to the Persons entitled to it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment. 

Each payment of the principal of and interest, Special Interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes due in cash shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. 

Subject to Section 4.1 and Section 5.1, the Company shall pay interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding the corresponding Interest Payment Date. Any such interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid (a) to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or (b) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange. 

In addition to any other payment required by the Notes and this Indenture, the Company shall make a one-time payment (a “Special Interest Payment”), as special interest (“Special Interest”), in an amount equal to [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding as of the Special Interest Record Date. The Special Interest Payment shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on a special interest payment record date (“Special Interest Payment Record Date”) for the payment of such Special Interest, which shall be four business days after the Acquisition Date. The Special Interest Payment shall be payable five business days after the completion of the Company’s acquisition of [[Organization 5 Name]] (the “Acquisition Date”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Notes are registered in the name of a Depositary or its nominee, all payments with respect to the Notes shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee. At the Stated Maturity, interest, Additional Amounts and Additional Interest, if any, on Certificated Securities will be payable at the office or agency of the Company described in Section 6.5. 

^Amendment to Section 6.13. 

The first paragraph of Section 6.13 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

“The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) (a) unless such Indebtedness (other than Credit Agreement Indebtedness) (i) matures after the Stated Maturity, (ii) is expressly subordinated to the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities in right of payment, whether in respect of payment of interest or upon liquidation or dissolution or otherwise, upon commercially reasonable terms that are no less favorable than the terms set forth in ARTICLE XIII hereof, (iii) does not require or permit at any time for the prepayment, repayment, repurchase or defeasance, directly or indirectly, of any principal or premium, if any, thereon until ninety-one (91) days after the Stated Maturity or later, and (iv) does not provide for total interest and fees in excess of [[Percentage 4: Number]]% per annum and (b) if the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Credit Agreement Indebtedness) would cause the Consolidated Leverage Ratio to exceed 4.00:1.00. The preceding sentence shall not be applicable to the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Company’s acquisition of [[Organization 5 Name]] in an aggregate amount not to exceed $[[USD Value 4: Number]] million in the form of a term loan pursuant to a credit agreement for a credit facility and/or a new series of notes or bonds pursuant to an indenture, provided that any credit agreement for a credit facility to be entered into in connection therewith may not include loan commitments in an amount greater than $[[USD Value 5: Number]] million less the amount of any notes or bonds issued under the indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) with respect to any business or company which the Company may acquire, for purposes of determining compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio test in this Section 6.13, Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated pro forma (without duplication) as if the acquired company or business had been owned during the entire four quarter period, on the basis of (x) the historical financial statements of any company or business so acquired, and (y) the assumption that the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been reformulated as if such acquisition had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant four quarter period, (ii) in no event shall the Company’s settlement agreements with the SEC and the Department of Justice or the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder

For purposes of this Section 6.13, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of a company or business by the Company, including the pro forma Consolidated EBITDA relating thereto, the pro forma calculations shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.13 shall not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively, **“Permitted Indebtedness”**):”
