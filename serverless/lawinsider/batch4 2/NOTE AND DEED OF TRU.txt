Lender shall deposit the Immediate Repair Deposit in a Subaccount (the “**Immediate Repair Reserve Subaccount**”). Provided that no Default or Event of Default (as such terms are defined in the Loan Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall disburse the funds in the Immediate Repair Reserve Subaccount to Borrower in accordance with the same procedure for which Lender shall disburse funds to Borrower that are in the Capital Reserve Subaccount pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Loan Agreement or the Rollover Reserve Subaccount pursuant to Section 3.5 of the Loan Agreement, and as if the Required Repairs are Approved Capital Expenses under Section 3.4 of the Loan Agreement or Approved Leasing Expenses under Section 3.5 of the Loan Agreement. The Immediate Repair Reserve Subaccount shall be treated as a Subaccount and one of the Cash Management Accounts for all purposes under Section 3.10 and any other applicable provision of the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

^^New Borrower shall use diligent efforts to complete or cause to be completed, and provide Lender with satisfactory evidence of such completion of, the Immediate Repairs by no later than one hundred eighty days (180) days from the date hereof (the “**Immediate Repair Period**”); provided, however, if all Immediate Repairs cannot be completed within the Immediate Repair Period despite diligent efforts by New Borrower to achieve the same, then and in such event the time period to complete any such remaining and outstanding Immediate Repairs shall be extended so long as New Borrower continues to use diligent efforts to complete or cause the completion of any such remaining Immediate Repairs. Upon completion of the Immediate Repairs, New Borrower shall pay for a Lender approved inspection company (“**Inspector**”) to inspect the Project to determine if the Immediate Repairs have been timely and fully completed. If the Immediate Repairs have not been timely and fully completed, the Inspector shall provide a written report regarding the status of the Immediate Repairs and shall specifically outline the work necessary to complete the Immediate Repairs, the estimated cost and a time frame for doing so. New Borrower shall complete the Immediate Repairs set forth in the Inspector’s report within the time frame set forth in the Inspector’s report or New Borrower shall be in default hereunder, whereupon, Lender, in addition to all other rights and remedies for default under the Loan Documents, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to use the funds being held under the Immediate Repair Reserve Subaccount or any other Subaccount to complete the Immediate Repairs. Upon completion of all Required Repairs, which completion shall be confirmed by the Inspector, Lender shall disburse the remainder of any of the Immediate Repair Reserve Subaccount funds to New Borrower. 

^^New Borrower shall use diligent efforts to complete or cause to be completed, and provide Lender with satisfactory evidence of such completion of, the non-deferrable item identified as D-1 on Exhibit E of the PCA (the “**Repairs**”), no later than one (1) year from the date hereof (the “**Repair Period**”); provided, however, if the Repairs cannot be completed within the Repair Period despite diligent efforts by New Borrower to achieve the same, then and in such event the time period to complete any such remaining and outstanding 

^^^^^ 
Repairs shall be extended so long as New Borrower continues to use diligent efforts to complete or cause the completion of any such remaining Repairs. 

^^**Business Risk Issue in Phase 1**. New Borrower shall use diligent efforts to complete, or cause AT&T to complete, all work related to Environmental Business Risk Issue # 2 (the AT&T generator and associated storage tank) recommended to be remedied in the Phase 1 by the first to occur of (i) one (1) year from the date hereof or (ii) the date that on such failure to repair causes a violation of law or of the Loan Documents. 

^^**Consent of Lender**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Lender hereby consents to the Requested Actions. Borrower Parties agree that this Agreement shall not be deemed an agreement by Lender to consent to any other transfer or conveyance of the Project or assumption of the Loan, or a consent to any secondary financing or secondary encumbrance on the Project or New Borrower or any interests in New Borrower. 

^^**UCC Filings**. New Borrower hereby grants and confirms unto Lender a first lien priority interest in all of New Borrower’s personal property and all of the fixtures located at the Project to the maximum extent permitted by the Uniform Commercial Code (“**UCC**”). Borrower Parties hereby consent to the filing of any financing statements or UCC forms required to be filed in the applicable states or any other applicable filing office, including, but not necessarily limited to, the state of organization of New Borrower and in the Records (collectively “**Filings**”) in order to perfect or continue the perfection of said interest and, notwithstanding anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary, in accordance with the UCC, as amended subsequent to the making of the Loan, said Filings may be made by Lender without the consent or signature of either of the Borrower Parties.
