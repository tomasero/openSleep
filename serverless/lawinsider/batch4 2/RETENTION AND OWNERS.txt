To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A, the provision will be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A.

^^The parties intend that the payments and benefits provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement be paid in compliance with Section 409A so that no excise tax is incurred under Section 409A. To the extent permitted by Section 409A and the Section 409A Regulations, the parties agree to modify this Agreement, the timing (but not the amount(s)) of the payments or benefits provided herein, or both, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A. 

^At-Will Employment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that Executive's employment with the Company is and shall continue to be "at-will." 

^Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute or claim between the parties, including any claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any reason, Executive and the Company agree that all such disputes shall be fully resolved by binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in Santa Clara County, under the AAA's National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect, which are available online at the AAA's website at www.adr.org. Executive and the Company each acknowledge and agree that they are waiving their respective rights to have any such disputes or claims tried by a judge or jury.
