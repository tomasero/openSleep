Initially, such staff and clerical support shall include those employees who, immediately prior to the Retirement Date, are assigned to assist Lione in discharging her duties as President of the Foundation, as determined by HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]]. 

^^Termination Without Cause. In the event that Lione’s employment at [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation is terminated by HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]] other than for Cause (defined below) prior to the Final Retirement Date, and provided that Lione executes, and does not revoke, a general release of claims against HDI, its subsidiaries and affiliates and the Foundation, and their respective past and present officers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, agents and employees, HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]] will provide Lione with the following: (w) payment of the amount equal to Four Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) less the pre-tax total of Base Salary (defined above) paid to Lione between [[Date 4]] and the date of the termination of Lione’s employment with [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, payable in a lump sum on the fortieth (40th) calendar day following such termination without Cause and subject to normal income and employment tax withholding, and (x) payment by HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]] of the total cost of Lione’s health insurance continuation coverage pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”), through the earlier of (y) the first twelve (12) months for which Lione is eligible for such COBRA coverage or (z) the Final Retirement Date, provided Lione elects COBRA coverage in a timely manner. The benefits provided by this Paragraph 2(g) shall not apply to the separation of Lione’s employment on the Final Retirement Date. 

^^^For purposes of this Paragraph 2(g), “Cause” shall mean (A) the conviction of Lione of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, theft or fraud; (B) Lione’s refusal to perform duties as directed in good faith by HDI’s Chief Executive Officer, which failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar days after written notice thereof from HDI’s Chief Executive Officer; (C) Lione’s engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment or any act involving theft or fraud with respect to HDI, [[Organization 2 Name]], the Foundation or any of their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates, as determined by HDI’s Chief Executive Officer; or (D) Lione’s reckless conduct or willful misconduct which results in substantial harm (in relation to Lione’s annual compensation), as determined by HDI’s Chief Executive Officer, whether financial, reputational or otherwise to HDI, [[Organization 2 Name]], the Foundation or any of their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates. 

^^^Following the Retirement Date, Lione will no longer be eligible for benefits under the Amended and Restated Severance Benefits Agreement (“SBA”) or the Transition Agreement (“Transition Agreement”) to which Lione is a party. 

^^Pension Plans. During Lione’s employment by [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, Lione will continue to participate in HDI’s qualified and nonqualified pension plans (collectively, the “Pension Plans”) pursuant to the terms of those plans. Upon Lione’s separation, for whatever reason, as an employee of [[Organization 2 Name]], Lione will retain her vested rights in the Pension Plans. In addition, following Lione’s separation, for whatever reason, from [[Organization 2 Name]], HDI or [[Organization 2 Name]] will pay Lione, in a lump sum, an amount equal to the difference between (i) the present value of the amount Lione would have received under the Pension Plans based on Lione’s Final Average Earnings (as defined under each of the Pension Plans) calculated as of [[Date 3]], and taking into account the additional years of credited service accrued by Lione through her separation date from [[Organization 2 Name]] and Lione’s age as of the date of her separation from [[Organization 2 Name]], and (ii) the present value of the amount Lione is entitled to receive under the Pension Plans pursuant to the terms of those plans as of the date Lione separates from [[Organization 2 Name]] (the “Pension Makeup Payment”). The Pension Makeup Payment will be paid to Lione within thirty (30) calendar days following Lione’s separation date from [[Organization 2 Name]], or, to the extent Lione is a “specified employee” for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) Section 409A (“Section 409A”), on the first day of the seventh (7th) month following such separation date. 

^^Retiree Insurance Allowance Plan. Due to the fact that Lione will satisfy the participation requirements set forth in Section 2.01 of the [[Organization 1 Name]] Retiree Insurance Allowance Plan as of the Retirement Date, during Lione’s employment by [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, Lione will continue to be entitled to receive the benefits provided under such plan upon her separation, for whatever reason, from [[Organization 2 Name]] and its affiliates, pursuant to the terms of such plan (including the timing of any payment) as in effect at the time of her separation as if she were a Participant in such plan by satisfying the participation requirements set forth in Section 2.01 of such plan immediately prior to her separation. Notwithstanding the terms of such plan, the Parties agree that Lione’s Base Compensation for purposes of such entitlement will be deemed to be Four Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 2]]). 

^^401(k) and Management Deferred Compensation Plan. During Lione’s employment by [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, Lione will continue to be eligible to participate in the [[Organization 1 Name]] 401(k) Plan and/or the [[Organization 1 Name]] Management Deferred Compensation Plan, determined based on Lione’s annual compensation and the applicable plan rules for each “plan year” during such employment. 

^^Equity. During Lione’s employment by [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, Lione will continue to vest in her outstanding stock options and restricted stock from the 2004 Incentive Stock Plan, and such awards will continue to be subject to the terms of the 2004 Incentive Stock Plan and the applicable award agreements governing each award. In addition, Lione’s outstanding stock options under the 2004 Incentive Stock Plan and the 1995 Stock Option Plan will not expire until three (3) years after Lione’s separation from employment with [[Organization 2 Name]] or ten (10) years from the grant date, whichever is earlier. Lione will not be eligible for any equity awards from HDI, its subsidiaries or affiliates for fiscal year 2010 or any subsequent fiscal year. 

^^Welfare Benefits. During Lione’s employment by [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, Lione will continue to be eligible to participate in the health and dental benefits and cafeteria plans offered by HDI or [[Organization 2 Name]], as applicable, and otherwise pursuant to the terms of such plans, and to be eligible to accrue credit for retiree medical benefits, as applicable, and otherwise pursuant to the terms of such plan. Subject to Paragraph 2(g), above, following Lione’s separation date as an employee of [[Organization 2 Name]], if and to the extent Lione or any of her eligible dependents are at that time participants in such health and dental insurance plans, Lione and such eligible dependents will be provided the right to continue to participate, at their own expense, in such plans pursuant to COBRA. 

^^Incentive Plans. Except as provided in this Paragraph 2(m), Lione will not be eligible to participate in any incentive plans of HDI, its subsidiaries or affiliates (including STIP or LTIP) for fiscal year 2010 or any subsequent fiscal year; provided, however, that Lione will be eligible to receive a STIP Performance Award payment for calendar year 2010, pro-rated for the portion of calendar year 2010 prior to the Retirement Date and determined by HDI’s Compensation Committee based on HDI’s actual achievement at year-end with respect to the Performance Categories approved by the Compensation Committee for the 2010 STIP. Such prorated STIP Performance Award, if any, will be paid to Lione when 2010 incentive bonuses are normally paid following the end of HDI’s fiscal year.

During Lione’s employment by [[Organization 2 Name]] as President of the Foundation, Lione will be entitled to the following HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]] executive perquisites pursuant to the normal requirements for use of such perquisites: (i) clothing allowance; (ii) motorcycle purchase discount and (iii) an executive financial planning allowance of up to Fifteen Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]) per calendar year, pro-rated for any partial calendar year of Lione’s employment in calendar year 2013 if Lione is employed in calendar year 2013. Lione acknowledges and agrees that her use and receipt of such perquisites may be taxable as determined by HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]] under the policies, practices and tax laws applicable to similarly situated executives of HDI and/or [[Organization 2 Name]].

^^Legal Assistance. Within thirty (30) calendar days following expiration of the Revocation Period (defined below), HDI shall reimburse Lione for up to Fifteen Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 3]]) in actual legal fees and costs incurred by Executive in the preparation of this Agreement; provided, however, that Lione complies with HDI’s requirements with respect to the reporting of such expenses.

Stat. Chapter 181, Article VI of the Foundation’s By-Laws and any insurance coverage purchased and maintained by the Foundation, HDI or [[Organization 2 Name]], on behalf of Foundation officers, pursuant to Article VI of such By-Laws; provided, however, that should such statutory indemnification and insurance coverage be insufficient to cover monetary liabilities incurred by Lione arising from a breach of, or failure to perform, any duty resulting solely from Lione’s status as an officer of the Foundation, HDI shall indemnify Lione from such monetary liabilities; provided, further however, that the Foundation, HDI and [[Organization 2 Name]], either individually or collectively, shall have no duty to indemnify or insure Lione with regard to any of the types of conduct specified in Wis.
