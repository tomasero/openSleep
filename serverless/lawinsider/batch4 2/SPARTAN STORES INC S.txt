For this purpose, the Participant's Accrued Benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the Pension Plan as in effect on the date the Participant incurs a Separation from Service.

The Participant's Accrued Benefit shall be converted to a lump sum amount for purposes of Section 4.3, in accordance with the Actuarial Equivalent principles set forth in the Pension Plan.

The Participant may change his Beneficiary designation at any time prior to death by completing a new Beneficiary designation form and filing it with Employer. (b) Benefit Payment to Spouse or Beneficiary If the Participant dies before his benefit begins to be paid under the Plan, his Spouse or Beneficiary may be eligible for a Death Benefit under this Plan.

The Beneficiary of the Death Benefit shall be the same individual the Participant has designated as his Beneficiary under the Pension Plan unless the Participant completes a separate Employer-provided Beneficiary designation form with respect to the distribution of this Plan's Death Benefit and returns it to Employer.

- -10-   

\centered **Other Termination of Employment and Noncompetition**

^^**Other Termination of Employment**

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no benefits shall be payable to the Participant or his Spouse or Beneficiary under the Plan in either of the following situations:

^^If the Participant has a Separation from Service before becoming entitled to benefits under the Plan; or (b) If the Participant's employment with Employer is terminated by Employer for cause, as defined in Section 6.2.  

^^**Termination of Employment for Cause**

^^For purposes of Section 6.1, a Participant is terminated for "cause" if his employment is terminated for any of the reasons set forth in this Section. (1) General Definition of Cause Except after a change in control (see paragraph (2) below), a Participant is terminated for "cause" if his employment is terminated for any of the following reasons: (A) Gross negligence, fraud, dishonesty or willful violation of any law or significant Employer policy, committed in connection with his employment and resulting in a material adverse effect on Employer; or (B) Failure to substantially perform (for reasons other than disability) the duties reasonably assigned to him in a manner consistent with prior practice. (2) **Definition of Cause After a Change in Control** Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, after a change in control, a Participant is terminated for "cause" if his employment is terminated for any of the following reasons: (A) The willful and continued failure by the Participant to substantially perform his duties with Employer (other than any such failure resulting from Participant's incapacity due to physical or mental injury or illness, or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting from Participant's termination for "good reason" (as that term is defined in the Participant's Executive Severance Agreement with Employer) after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Participant by the Board of Directors (which demand shall specifically identify the manner  

- -11-    in which the Board of Directors believes that the Participant has not substantially performed his duties); or (B) The willful engaging by the Participant in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to Employer. For this purpose, no act or failure to act on the part of the Participant shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by the Participant not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action(s) or omission(s) was in the best interests of Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be deemed to have been terminated for cause unless and until Employer provides Participant with a copy of a resolution adopted by an affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the entire membership of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board of Directors called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to the Participant and an opportunity for the Participant, with counsel, to be heard before the Board of Directors), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors the Participant has been guilty of conduct set forth in (1) or (2) above, setting forth the particulars in d etail. A determination for cause by the Board of Directors shall not be binding upon or entitled to deference by any finder of fact in the event of a dispute, it being the intent of the parties that such finder of fact shall make an independent determination of whether the termination was for "cause" as defined in (1) or (2) above. (b) The definition of "cause" in this Section is relevant only for purposes of eligibility for benefits under this Plan, and is not intended to change the status of a Participant as an "at will" Employee of Employer. (c) If Employer determines that a Participant is ineligible for benefits because the Participant's employment was terminated for cause and the Participant disputes that determination, the Participant's sole remedy after exhausting the claims procedure of Section 7.5 shall be arbitration. The arbitration procedure is attached to the Plan as Appendix B.  

^^**Noncompetition**

Any Participant who has a Separation from Service with Employer shall not engage in "competition" with Employer within three years after retirement. For this purpose, a Participant is engaged in "competition" if he accepts employment, is retained as a consultant or receives any consideration, financial or otherwise, by or from a competing business (as determined by Employer's Board of Directors).

If a Participant violates this noncompetition provision, his benefits under the Plan shall be reduced by the amount of "compensation" received from the competing business during the three-year noncompetition period described in the immediately preceding paragraph. For this purpose, "compensation" includes the total value of any monetary compensation and nonmonetary compensation, including any amounts deferred during the three-year

- -12-   

noncompetition period. If the Participant is self-employed, "compensation" means gross income before expenses.

Employer shall have the right to obtain sufficient information regarding compensation from a competing retail business to calculate the reduction in benefits described in this Section. If the Participant fails to provide timely or complete information, benefit payments shall cease until such information is provided.

However, after a change in control, as described in Section 5.1, this Section shall not apply.

\centered **Administration**

^^**Plan Administrator**

Employer shall have the sole responsibility for the administration of the Plan and is designated as named fiduciary and Plan Administrator.

^^**Appointment of Administrative Committee**

Employer may delegate all or a portion of its duties as Plan Administrator to an Administrative Committee. The members of the administrative committee shall be selected by Employer. If an administrative committee is appointed, it shall have the power and duties of the Plan Administrator which are described in this Article and which are delegated to the administrative committee.

^^**Powers of Plan Administrator**

The Plan Administrator shall have all discretionary powers necessary to administer, and satisfy its obligations under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:

^^Maintain records pertaining to the Plan. (b) Interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan. (c) Establish procedures by which Participants may apply for pension benefits under the Plan and appeal a denial of pension benefits. (d) Determine the rights under the Plan of any Participant applying for or receiving pension benefits.  

- -13-    (e) Administer the claims procedure provided in this Article. (f) Perform all acts necessary to meet the reporting and disclosure obligations imposed by Sections 101 through 111 of ERISA. (g) Delegate specific responsibilities for the operation and administration of the Plan to such employees or agents as it deems advisable and necessary.  

^^**Standard of Care**

The Plan Administrator shall administer the Plan solely in the interest of Participants and for the exclusive purposes of providing pension benefits to such Participants and their beneficiaries. The Plan Administrator shall administer the Plan with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person, acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters, would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.

The Plan Administrator shall not be liable for any act or omission relating to its duties under the Plan, unless the act or omission violates the standard of care described in this Section.

^^**Claims Procedure**

Any Participant whose application for benefits under the Plan has been denied, in whole or in part, shall be given written notice of the denial of benefits by the Plan Administrator. The notice shall be in easily understood language and shall indicate the reasons for denial and the specific provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based. The notice shall explain that the Participant may request a review of the denial and the procedure for requesting review. The notice shall describe any additional information necessary to perfect the Participant's claim and explain why such information is necessary.

^Participant may make a written request to the Plan Administrator for a review of any denial of benefits under this Plan. The request for review must be in writing and must be made within 90 days after the mailing date of the notice of denial. The request shall refer to the provisions of the Plan on which it is based and shall set forth the facts relied upon as justifying a reversal or modification of the determination being appealed.

^Participant who requests a review of a denial of benefits in accordance with this claims procedure may examine pertinent documents and submit pertinent issues and comments in writing. A Participant may have a duly authorized representative act on his behalf in exercising his right to request a review and any other rights granted by this claims procedure. The Plan Administrator shall provide a review of the decision denying the claim for benefit within 60 days after receiving the written request for review.

- -14-   

However, after a change in control as described in Section 5.1, the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Schedule 11(c) of the Participant's Executive Severance Agreement with Employer shall be substituted for the claims procedure set forth in this Section and in Appendix B. Further, in the event of a dispute between the Participant and Employer and/or the Plan Administrator after a change in control as described in Section 5.1, the determinations of Employer and/or the Plan Administrator shall not be entitled to deference, it being the intent of the parties that there shall be independent determinations of any disputed fact or issue through the dispute resolution procedure.

\centered **Miscellaneous**

^^**Funding of Benefits**

The Plan shall be unfunded, except as provided in Section 5.4. Although Employer may make corporate investments to fund its potential liability under the Plan, all benefits shall be paid directly by Employer from its general assets to Participants who qualify for benefits. Employer's obligation to pay benefits under the Plan shall be unsecured.

^^**Spendthrift Provision**

No benefit or interest under the Plan is subject to assignment or alienation, whether voluntary or involuntary. Any assignment or alienation of benefits shall be void.

^^**Employment Rights**

The existence of the Plan shall not grant a Participant any legal right to continue as an Associate nor affect the right of Employer to discharge a Participant.

^^**Amendment or Termination**

Employer shall have the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time by action of its Board of Directors. However, no amendment or termination shall reduce a Participant's benefits to an amount less than the benefit to which the Participant would be entitled under the Plan if he had a Separation from Service as of the date of the amendment or termination. The effect of Employer's amendment or termination of the Plan on a Participant's benefit, as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, is subject to Section 5.1 (which requires a Participant's benefits to be nonforfeitable and fully vested upon a change in control) and the terms of any applicable employment agreement between Employer and a Participant.

In addition, the Employer may pay the Participant the full value of the Participant's benefit at any time after the Plan is terminated if the payment is permitted by Section 409A of the Code.

- -15-   

^^**Construction**

Words used in the masculine shall apply to the feminine where applicable; and wherever the context of the Plan dictates, the plural shall be read as the singular and the singular as the plural.

^^**Executive Severance Agreement**

Each Participant shall enter into an Executive Severance Agreement with Employer. It is intended that the terms of the Plan with respect to a Participant be interpreted in a manner consistent with that Participant's Executive Severance Agreement. Thus, with respect to a Participant, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of the Participant's Executive Severance Agreement, the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement shall control to the extent the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement are consistent with Code Section 409A.

^^**Governing Law**

To the extent that Michigan law is not preempted by ERISA, the provisions of the Plan shall be governed by the laws of the state of Michigan.

^I agree that my benefits are governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan. 2.

\centered **Arbitration Procedure**

^Before taking recourse to arbitration, the Participant must exhaust the Claims Procedure in Section 7.5.

^Notice of intent to arbitrate a claim must be made, in writing, within 90 days after the mailing date of the Plan Administrator's decision under Section 6.4 denying the claim for benefit.

^The arbitrator will be selected by the mutual agreement of the Participant and the Plan Administrator. If the arbitrator is not selected by other means, then the arbitrator will be selected from a panel of experienced labor and employment arbitrators supplied by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), utilizing AAA procedures regarding selection of the arbitrator.

^The arbitrator will decide the time and place of a hearing, which will be conducted according to AAA Rules. At the arbitration hearing, the Participant will have the opportunity to rebut the evidence presented by the Plan Administrator and the Participant may present witnesses and evidence to support his case.

^The arbitrator will decide, in writing, whether the Participant was terminated for cause as provided in Section 6.2. The arbitrator shall have no authority to change, add to, or delete any of the provisions of the Plan.

^The Participant and the Plan Administrator shall each pay up to one-half of the arbitrator's fees and expenses, except that the Participant's total payment shall not exceed $250. If the arbitrator decides in favor of the Participant, the Participant's payment shall be waived.

^The Participant and the Plan Administrator will each be responsible for their own costs, including attorney's fees. If either party decides to be represented by an attorney, that party will notify the other at least 30 days before the arbitration hearing.

^This review procedure, including an appeal to arbitration and the decision of the arbitrator, is the Participant's exclusive remedy, is final and binding on all parties, and is fully enforceable in court.
