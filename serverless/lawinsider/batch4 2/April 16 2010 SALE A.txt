8.1.3      Such Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the covenants provided for in Section 8.1.1 are reasonable and necessary in terms of time, area and line of business to protect the Purchaser’s, [[Organization 3 Name]]’s, the Company’s, the Subsidiary’s or their Affiliates’ trade secrets. Such Guarantor further acknowledges and agrees that such covenants are reasonable and necessary

^^^^^ 
in terms of time, area and line of business to protect the legitimate business interests of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, which include its interests in protecting the Purchaser’s, [[Organization 3 Name]]’s, the Company’s, the Subsidiary’s or their Affiliates’ (i) valuable confidential business information, (ii) substantial relationships with customers throughout the world, and (iii) customer goodwill associated with the ongoing business of the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary or their Affiliates. Such Guarantor expressly authorizes the enforcement of the covenants provided for in Section 8.1.1 by (A) the Purchaser, [[Organization 3 Name]], the Company, the Subsidiary or their Affiliates, (B) the Purchaser’s permitted assigns, and (C) any successors to the Purchaser, [[Organization 3 Name]], the Company, the Subsidiary or their Affiliates or the Purchaser’s, the Company, the Subsidiary or their Affiliates business. The Parties agree that they have attempted to restrict such Guarantor’s activities to a reasonable degree appropriate to protect the interests of the Purchaser, [[Organization 3 Name]], and the Company although they agree that others may disagree about this determination. Therefore, the Parties agree that a court or other trier of fact may modify and enforce these restrictions to the minimum extent deemed necessary to be found reasonable. If a court declines to modify and enforce this Agreement as provided above, the Parties agree that this Agreement will be automatically modified to provide the Purchaser with the maximum protection of its business interests allowed by law and the Guarantors agree to be bound by such Agreement as modified; but in no event shall the Purchaser be entitled to greater rights than it has under this Agreement.
