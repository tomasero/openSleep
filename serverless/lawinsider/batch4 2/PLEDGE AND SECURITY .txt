Such Grantor shall (a) not use or knowingly permit its Collateral to be used unlawfully or in violation of any provision of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Requirement of Law (except, in each case, to the extent such violation could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect) or any policy of insurance covering the Collateral, (b) not enter into any agreement or undertaking restricting the right or ability of such Grantor or the Administrative Agent to sell, assign or transfer any Collateral (except to the extent permitted under Section 8.10 of the Credit Agreement) and (c) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of its entry into any material agreement or assumption of undertaking that restricts the ability to sell, assign or transfer any Collateral in a manner adverse to the Administrative Agent.

^^Such Grantor shall furnish to the Administrative Agent from time to time statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

^^At any time and from time to time, upon the reasonable written request of the Administrative Agent, and at the sole expense of such Grantor, such Grantor shall promptly and duly execute and deliver, and have recorded, such further instruments and documents and take such further action as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted, including the filing of any financing or continuation statement under the UCC (or other similar laws) in effect in any jurisdiction with respect to the security interest created hereby and the execution and, subject to Sections 7.13(a) and (f) of the Credit Agreement, delivery of Deposit Account Control Agreements and Securities Account Control Agreements with respect to the Collateral required pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

^***Pledged Collateral***

^^Such Grantor shall (i) deliver to the Administrative Agent, all certificates and Instruments representing or evidencing any of its Pledged Collateral (including Additional Pledged Collateral), whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in suitable form for transfer by delivery or, as applicable, accompanied by such Grantor’s endorsement, where necessary, or duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, together, in respect of any Additional Pledged Collateral, with a Pledge Amendment, duly executed by the Grantor, in substantially the form of Annex I, an acknowledgment and agreement to a Joinder Agreement duly executed by the Grantor, in substantially the form of Annex II, or such other documentation reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and (ii) maintain all other Pledged Collateral constituting Investment Property in a Control Account.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, if any sum of money or property so paid or distributed in respect of any Pledged Collateral shall be received by such Grantor, such Grantor shall, until such money or property is paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent, hold such money or property in trust for the Administrative Agent, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, as additional security for the Obligations.

^^Except as provided in Article V, such Grantor shall be entitled to exercise all voting, consent and corporate, partnership, limited liability company and similar rights with respect to its Pledged Collateral; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast, consent given or right exercised or other action taken by such Grantor that would result in any violation of any provision of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or, without prior notice to the Administrative Agent, enable or permit any issuer of Pledged Collateral to issue any Stock or other equity Securities of any nature or to issue any other securities convertible into or granting the right to purchase or exchange for any Stock or other equity Securities of any nature of any issuer of Pledged Collateral.

^^In the case of each Grantor that is an issuer of Pledged Collateral, such Grantor agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement relating to the Pledged Collateral issued by it and shall comply with such terms insofar as such terms are applicable to it.

Such Grantor agrees to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such certificates, agreements and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to evidence, formalize or otherwise give effect to the consents given in this clause (e).

^^Such Grantor shall not, without the consent of the Administrative Agent,  agree to any amendment of any Constituent Document that in any way adversely affects the perfection of the security interest of the Administrative Agent in the Pledged Collateral pledged by such Grantor hereunder, including any amendment electing to treat any membership interest or partnership interest that is part of the Pledged Collateral as a “security” under Section 8-103 of the UCC, or any election to turn any previously uncertificated Stock that is part of the Pledged Collateral into certificated Stock.

^^Except to the extent permitted by the Credit Agreement, such Grantor will not (i) permit or suffer any issuer of Stock constituting Pledged Collateral owned by it to dissolve, merge, liquidate, retire any of its Stock or other Instruments or Securities evidencing ownership, reduce its capital, sell or encumber all or substantially all of its assets (except for Permitted Liens and sales of assets permitted pursuant to Section 4.11) or merge or consolidate with any other entity or (ii) vote any such Pledged Collateral in favor of any of the foregoing.

Until so turned over or turned over, such payment shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent.

^^At the Administrative Agent’s request, at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent all original and other documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions that gave rise to its Accounts or payments in respect of its General Intangibles.

^^The Administrative Agent may, without notice, at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, limit or terminate the authority of a Grantor to collect its Accounts or amounts due under General Intangibles or any thereof.

^^Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall notify Account Debtors that its Accounts or General Intangibles have been collaterally assigned to the Administrative Agent and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Administrative Agent. In addition, the Administrative Agent may enforce such Grantor’s rights against such Account Debtors and obligors of General Intangibles.

^^Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Accounts and payments in respect of General Intangibles to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto. Unless expressly assumed, neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any agreement giving rise to an Account or a payment in respect of a General Intangible by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any obligation of any Grantor under or pursuant to any agreement giving rise to an Account or a payment in respect of a General Intangible, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts that may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

^^^Each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time, during the continuance of an Event of Default, compromise with the obligor on any Receivable, accept in full payment of any Receivable such amount as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall determine or abandon any Receivable, and any such action by the Administrative Agent shall be commercially reasonable so long as the Administrative Agent acts in good faith based on information known to it at the time it takes any such action.

^***Inventory and Equipment***

^^Such Grantor will do all things commercially reasonable to maintain, preserve, protect and keep its Inventory and the Equipment necessary in the conduct of its business in good repair and working and saleable condition, except for damaged or defective goods arising in the ordinary course of such Grantor’s business and except for ordinary wear and tear, casualty and condemnation in respect of the Equipment, except where failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

^^Such Grantor shall not permit any Equipment to become a fixture with respect to real property or to become an accession with respect to other personal property with respect to which real or personal property the Administrative Agent does not have a Lien.

^***Delivery of Instruments and Chattel Paper***

If any amount in excess of $[[USD Value 2]] payable under or in connection with any Collateral owned by such Grantor shall be or become evidenced by an Instrument or Chattel Paper, such Grantor shall promptly deliver such Instrument or Chattel Paper to the Administrative Agent, duly indorsed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, or, if consented to by the Administrative Agent, shall mark all such Instruments and Chattel Paper with the following legend: “This writing and the obligations evidenced or secured hereby are subject to the security interest of [[Organization 2 Name]], as Administrative Agent”.

**Remedial Provisions**

^***Code and Other Remedies***

^^During the continuance of an Event of Default and subject to the terms of the Orders, the Administrative Agent may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or any other applicable law. Subject to the terms of the Orders, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon any Collateral, and may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver any Collateral (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker’s board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by the UCC and other applicable law and the Orders, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption of any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, (i) at the Administrative Agent’s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places that the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor’s premises or elsewhere and (ii) to permit the Administrative Agent, by the Administrative Agent's representatives and agents, to enter, occupy and use any premises where all or any part of the Collateral, or the books and records relating thereto, or both, are located, to take possession of all or any part of the Collateral or the books and records relating thereto, or both, to remove all or any part of the Collateral or the books and records relating thereto, or both, and to conduct sales of the Collateral, without any obligation to pay the Grantor for such use and occupancy. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 5.1(a), after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and any other Secured Party hereunder, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements to the extent required under Section 13.2 of the Credit Agreement, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as the Credit Agreement shall prescribe, and only after such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent such liability is determined in a final, non-appealable judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such Person’s (or any of their representative’s or agent’s) gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.

^***Pledged Collateral***

^^During the continuance of an Event of Default and subject to the terms of the Orders, upon notice by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any Proceeds of the Pledged Collateral and make application thereof to the Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement and (ii) the Administrative Agent or its nominee may exercise (A) any voting, consent, corporate and other right pertaining to the Pledged Collateral at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, of the relevant issuer or issuers of Pledged Collateral or otherwise and (B) any right of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other right, privilege or option pertaining to the Pledged Collateral as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange at its discretion any of the Pledged Collateral upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or equivalent structure of any issuer of Pledged Stock, the right to deposit and deliver any Pledged Collateral with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.

^^In order to permit the Administrative Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual rights that it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions that it may be entitled to receive hereunder, (i) each Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Administrative Agent all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request, which proxies shall be effective only during the continuance of an Event of Default and (ii) without limiting the effect of clause (i) above, such Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable proxy to vote all or any part of the Pledged Collateral and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Collateral would be entitled (including giving or withholding written consents of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, calling special meetings of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and voting at such meetings), which proxy shall be effective, automatically and without the necessity of any action (including any transfer of any Pledged Collateral on the record books of the issuer thereof) by any other person (including the issuer of such Pledged Collateral or any officer or agent thereof), during the continuance of an Event of Default and which proxy shall only terminate upon the payment in full of the Obligations.

^^Each Grantor hereby expressly authorizes and instructs each issuer of any Pledged Collateral pledged hereunder by such Grantor to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (A) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that such issuer shall be fully protected in so complying and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby or Section 8.10 of the Credit Agreement, pay any dividend or other payment with respect to such Pledged Collateral directly to the Administrative Agent.

^^After the Administrative Agent acknowledges that all Events of Default have been cured or waived in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, and so long as the Obligations shall not have been accelerated, each Grantor shall have the right to exercise the voting and other consensual rights and powers that it would have otherwise been entitled to pursuant to Section 4.4(c), and receive dividends and other distributions it would have been authorized to receive pursuant to Section 4.4(b). After the Administrative Agent acknowledges that all Events of Default have been cured or waived in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any dividend or distribution theretofore paid to the Administrative Agent shall upon the request of the Grantors (except to the extent theretofore applied to the Obligations) promptly be returned to the Grantors.

^***Proceeds to be Turned Over To Administrative Agent***

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Credit Agreement, all Proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder in cash or Cash Equivalents shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a Cash Collateral Account. All Proceeds while held by the Administrative Agent in a Cash Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent) shall continue to be held as collateral security for the Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in the Credit Agreement.

^***Registration Rights***

^^Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any Pledged Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise or may determine that a public sale is impracticable or not commercially reasonable and, accordingly, may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers that shall be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.

^^Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.4 valid and binding and in compliance with all other applicable Requirements of Law; provided that such Grantor is not required to file a registration statement in connection with any of its Pledged Collateral under the Securities Act or otherwise if the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that a private sale is practicable and commercially reasonable. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any covenant contained in this Section 5.4 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and other Secured Parties, that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 5.4 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees, to the extent permitted by law, not to assert any defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.

^***Deficiency***

Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorney employed by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

^***Waivers***

Each Grantor hereby waives any and all rights that it may otherwise have (whether any such right is contractual or exists pursuant to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of any relevant entity or under applicable law) that would interfere with this Agreement or the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any rights or remedies granted to it pursuant to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 4 Name]] hereby waive any transfer restriction on the stock of [[Organization 4 Name]], including, without limitation, any right of first refusal or right of first offer set forth in Section 6.10 of the Bylaws of [[Organization 4 Name]], (ii) [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 5 Name]] hereby waive any transfer restriction on the stock of [[Organization 5 Name]], including, without limitation, any right of first refusal or right of first offer set forth in Section 4 of the Articles of Incorporation of [[Organization 5 Name]], and (iii) [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 6 Name]] hereby waive any transfer restriction on the stock of [[Organization 6 Name]], including, without limitation, any right of first refusal or right of first offer set forth in Article V of the Articles of Incorporation of [[Organization 6 Name]]

**The Administrative Agent**

^***Administrative Agent’s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact***

^^Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any appropriate action and to execute any document or instrument that may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice or assent by such Grantor, to do any of the following:

^^^in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and indorse and collect any check, draft, note, acceptance or other instrument for the payment of moneys due under any Account or General Intangible or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any such moneys due under any Account or General Intangible or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;

^^^in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any agreement, instrument, document or paper as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the Administrative Agent’s security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and General Intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;

^^^pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repair or pay any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement (including all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof);

^^^execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 5.1 or 5.4, any endorsement, assignment or other instrument of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; or

^^(A) direct any party liable for any payment under any Collateral to make payment of any moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the Administrative Agent shall direct, (B) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral, (C) sign and indorse any invoice, freight or express bill, bill of lading, storage or warehouse receipt, draft against debtors, assignment, verification, notice and other document in connection with any Collateral, (D) commence and prosecute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect any Collateral and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral, (E) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral, (F) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate, (G) assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Trademark pertains) throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine, including the execution and filing of any document necessary to effectuate or record such assignment and (H) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any Collateral as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent’s option and such Grantor’s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things that the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agent’s and the other Secured Parties’ security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.

Anything in this clause (a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent agrees that it shall not exercise any right under the power of attorney provided for in this clause (a) unless an Event of Default shall be continuing and subject to the terms of the Orders.

^^If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, upon one Business Day’s prior notice, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.

^^The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 6.1, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum at which interest would then be payable on past due Revolving Loans that are CBFR Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Administrative Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent on written demand.

^^Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released

^***Duty of Administrative Agent***

The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. The Administrative Agent shall use reasonable care with respect to the Collateral in its possession or under its control. The Administrative Agent shall not have any other duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or nominee of the Administrative Agent, or any income thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Administrative Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that it is commercially reasonable for the Administrative Agent (i) to fail to incur expenses deemed significant by the Administrative Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to transform raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (ii) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (iv) to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (v) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vi) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as such Grantor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (vii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (viii) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (ix) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (x) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (xi) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Administrative Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Administrative Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (xii) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist the Administrative Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Grantor acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 6.2 is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Administrative Agent would be commercially reasonable in the Administrative Agent's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 6.2. Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be construed to grant any rights to any Grantor or to impose any duties on the Administrative Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Security Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this Section 6.2.

^***Authorization of Financing Statements***

Each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, counsel and other representatives, at any time and from time to time, to file or record financing statements, amendments to financing statements, and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral in such form and in such offices as the Administrative Agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, and such financing statements and amendments may described the Collateral covered thereby as “all assets of the debtor”, “all personal property of the debtor” or words of similar effect. Each Grantor hereby also authorizes the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, counsel and other representatives, at any time and from time to time, to file continuation statements with respect to previously filed financing statements. A photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement or other filing or recording document or instrument for filing or recording in any jurisdiction.

^***Authority of Administrative Agent***

[[Organization 2 Name]] has been appointed Administrative Agent for the Lenders hereunder pursuant to Article X of the Credit Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties to this Agreement that any authority conferred upon the Administrative Agent hereunder is subject to the terms of the delegation of authority made by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and that the Administrative Agent has agreed to act (and any successor Administrative Agent shall act) as such hereunder only on the express conditions contained in such Article X. Any successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to Article X of the Credit Agreement shall be entitled to all the rights, interests and benefits of the Administrative Agent hereunder.

**Miscellaneous**

^***Amendments in Writing***

None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in accordance with Section 13.1 of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that annexes to this Agreement may be supplemented (but no existing provisions may be modified and no Collateral may be released) through Pledge Amendments and Joinder Agreements, in substantially the form of Annex I and Annex II respectively, in each case duly executed by the Administrative Agent and each Grantor directly affected thereby.

^***Notices***

All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 13.7 of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Grantor shall be addressed to the Borrower’s notice address set forth in such Section 13.7.

^***No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies***

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 7.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

^***Successors and Assigns***

This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

^***Counterparts***

This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by telecopy or email), each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Signature pages may be detached from multiple counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are attached to the same document. Delivery of an executed counterpart by telecopy or email shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart.

^***Severability***

Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

^***Section Headings***

The Article and Section titles contained in this Agreement are, and shall be, without substantive meaning or content of any kind whatsoever and are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto.

^***Entire Agreement***

This Agreement together with the other Loan Documents represents the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

^***Governing Law***

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

^***Additional Grantors***

If, pursuant to Section 7.12 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower shall be required to cause any Subsidiary that is not a Grantor to become a Grantor hereunder, such Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Joinder Agreement substantially in the form of Annex II and shall thereafter for all purposes be a party hereto and have the same rights, benefits and obligations as a Grantor party hereto on the Closing Date.

^***Release of Collateral***

^^At such time as the Loans and the other Obligations (other than contingent indemnification and contingent expense reimbursement obligations) shall have been paid in full in cash or otherwise satisfied in accordance with the Credit Agreement or the applicable order of the Bankruptcy Court and the Commitments have been terminated or expired, the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Administrative Agent and each Grantor hereunder shall automatically terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors. At the request and sole expense of any Grantor following any such termination, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Grantor any Collateral of such Grantor held by the Administrative Agent hereunder and execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.

^^If any of the Collateral (including the Capital Stock of such Grantor) shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, such Collateral shall be automatically released from the Lien created hereby. In connection therewith, the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor, shall execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases or other documents reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created hereby on such Collateral.

^***Termination.***

This Security Agreement shall continue in effect (notwithstanding the fact that from time to time there may be no Obligations outstanding) until (i) the Credit Agreement has terminated pursuant to its express terms and (ii) all of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations and contingent reimbursement obligations) have been paid in full (or with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit, a cash deposit or has been delivered to the Administrative Agent as required by the Credit Agreement) and the Commitments of the Lenders have been terminated.

^***Reinstatement***

Each Grantor further agrees that, if any payment made by any Loan Party or other Person and applied to the Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of Collateral are required to be returned by any Secured Party to such Loan Party, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including any Grantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, any Lien or other Collateral securing such liability shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made or, if prior thereto the Lien granted hereby or other Collateral securing such liability hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation or surrender), such Lien or other Collateral shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect any Lien or other Collateral securing the obligations of any Grantor in respect of the amount of such payment.

^***Interim Order and Final Order***

The terms and conditions hereunder shall be subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Interim Order or the Final Order, as applicable.
