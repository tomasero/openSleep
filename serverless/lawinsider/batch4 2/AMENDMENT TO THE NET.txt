\centered **AMENDMENT TO THE**  **[[Company]]**  **RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT**  **FOR NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES** 

**THIS AMENDMENT** is dated [[Date 1: Date]], and is between **[[Company]]**, a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Company”), and **[[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]]** (the “Participant”). 

The parties entered into the **[[Company]]** Restricted Stock Agreement for Non-U.S. Employees, effective as of [[Date 2: Date]] (the “Agreement”). The Agreement evidences the award of 40,000 restricted shares of Company common stock, par value $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share, under the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan of **[[Company]]** The restricted shares vest ratably on [[Date 3: Date]] of 2009, 2010, and 2011, based on the Participant’s continued service to the Company through the applicable vesting date and a [[Percentage 1: Number]]% increase, compounded annually, in fundamental earnings per share (diluted) (expressed in South African rand) (defined in the Agreement as “Fundamental EPS”) for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 fiscal years. 

One-third of the restricted shares vested on [[Date 4: Date]], after the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company used its discretion to determine that the Fundamental EPS target was met for the fiscal year ending [[Date 5: Date]], after accounting for unusual and non-recurring events. On [[Date 6: Date]], the Board of Directors of the Company, upon recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, determined to amend the award such that the Fundamental EPS target is [[Percentage 2: Number]]% for the remaining two tranches of restricted shares that are scheduled to vest, if at all, on [[Date 3]] of 2010 and 2011. No consent of the Participant is required for the amendment under section 10.3 of the Agreement because the modification would have no materially adverse effect on the restricted shares. Nevertheless, the parties desire to formally adopt this Amendment to memorialize the action of the Board of Directors of the Company on [[Date 6]]. 

CONSEQUENTLY, in consideration for the promises contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree to amend the Agreement, effective as of [[Date 6]], as follows: 

^Section 2(c) is hereby amended by revising the second sentence of that section to read as follows (revisions marked): 

> > Specifically, the financial performance targets set forth in the table are based on a [[Percentage 1]]%[[Percentage 2]]% increase, compounded annually, in fundamental earnings per share (diluted) (expressed in South African rand) (referred to hereafter as “***Fundamental EPS***”) above the Fundamental EPS for the fiscal year ended [[Date 7: Date]].

^In all other respects, the Agreement is hereby ratified and confirmed.
