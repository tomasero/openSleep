The purchase rights represented by the Warrant Certificate are exercisable at the option of the Holder hereof, in whole or in part. In the case of the purchase of less than all of the Shares purchasable under any Warrant Certificate, the Company shall cancel said Warrant Certificate upon the surrender thereof and shall execute and deliver a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor for the balance of the Shares. As used in this Agreement, the terms “Holder” and “Holders” refer to the registered holder of a Warrant Certificate or the Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants as the context requires. 

^^Cashless Exercise. At any time during the Warrant Term, the Holder may, at the Holder’s option, exchange, in whole or in part, the Warrants represented by such Holder’s Warrant Certificate which are exercisable for the purchase of Shares into the number of Shares determined in accordance with this Article 2.2 (a “Warrant Exchange”), by surrendering such Warrant Certificate at the principal office of the Company or at the office of its transfer agent, accompanied by a notice stating such Holder’s intent to effect such exchange, the number of Warrants to be so exchanged and the date on which the Holder requests that such Warrant Exchange occur (the “Notice of Exchange”).

In connection with any Warrant Exchange, the Holder shall be entitled to subscribe for and acquire (i) the number of Shares (rounded to the next highest integer) which would, but for such Warrant Exchange, then be issuable pursuant to the provisions of Article 2.1 above upon the exercise of the Warrants specified by the Holder in its Notice of Exchange (the “Total Share Number”) less (ii) the number of Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the product of the Total Share Number and the existing Exercise Price per Share (as hereinafter defined) by (b) the Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of a Public Share on the trading day immediately preceding the Exchange Date. “Market Price” at any date shall be deemed to be the closing sale price or, in case no reported sales takes place on such day, the average of the closing sale prices for the last three consecutive trading days on which reported sales have taken place, in either case as officially reported by the principal securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the closing bid price as reported by (i) [[Organization 2 Name]] (or any successor thereto) (“[[Organization 2 Name]]”) through the OTC Bulletin Board or successor trading market or (ii) if not listed on the OTC Bulletin Board (or its successor market), the “pink sheets.” If the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, and bid prices are not reported by [[Organization 2 Name]] through the OTC Bulletin Board or successor trading market, or the “pink sheets,” then the Market Price shall be determined in good faith by the mutual agreement of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Holder, where the Board of Directors of the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Holder its proposed market price and an analysis setting forth the basis for its determination.

^Issuance of Stock Certificates.

Upon the exercise of the Warrants, the issuance of certificates for the Shares purchased shall be made no later than ten (10) business days thereafter without charge to the Holder thereof including, without limitation, any tax which may be payable in respect of the issuance thereof, and such certificates shall (subject to the provisions of Article 4) be issued in the name of the Holder thereof, or, if a sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of the Warrants or the Shares to be issued upon exercise thereof would be permitted by this Agreement and applicable federal and state securities laws, in such names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificates in a name other than that of the Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

^Registration Rights.

^^Registration Under the Securities Act of 1933. As of the date hereof, none of the Warrants or the Shares have been registered for purposes of public resale or distribution under the Act.

^^Registrable Securities. As used herein, the term “Registrable Security” means each of the Shares and any shares of Common Stock issued upon any stock split or stock dividend in respect of such Shares; provided, however, that with respect to any particular Registrable Security, such security shall cease to be a Registrable Security when, as of the date of determination, (i) it has been registered under the Act and disposed of pursuant thereto, (ii) registration under the Act is no longer required for the Holder for subsequent public distribution of such security under Rule 144 promulgated under the Act or otherwise, or (iii) it has ceased to be outstanding. The term “Registrable Securities” means any and/or all of the securities falling within the foregoing definition of a “Registrable Security.” In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization or other change in corporate structure affecting the Common Stock, such adjustment shall be made in the definition of “Registrable Security” as is appropriate in order to prevent any dilution or enlargement of the rights granted pursuant to this Article 7.

^^Piggyback Registration. If, within seven (7) years following the effective date of the Public Offering, the Company proposes to prepare and file one or more post-effective amendments to the registration statement filed in connection with the Public Offering or any new registration statement or post-effective amendments thereto covering equity or debt securities of the Company, or any such securities of the Company held by its shareholders (in any such case, other than in connection with a merger, acquisition or pursuant to Form S-8 or successor form)(for purposes of this Article 7, collectively, the “Registration Statement”), it will give written notice of its intention to do so (“Notice”), at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of each such Registration Statement, to all Holders of the Registrable Securities.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 7.3, the Company shall have the right at any time after it shall have given written notice pursuant to this Article 7.3 (irrespective of whether any written request for inclusion of Registrable Securities shall have already been made) to elect not to file any such proposed Registration Statement, or to withdraw the same after the filing but prior to the effective date thereof, without incurring any liability to any Holder of Registrable Securities.

^^Demand Registration.

^^At any time beginning at such time as the Company is eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Act (or applicable successor form) for secondary offerings of securities and ending five (5) years after the effective date of the Public Offering, any “Majority Holder” (as such term is defined in Article 7.4(c) below) of the Registrable Securities shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Company (the “Demand Registration Request”), to have the Company prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on one occasion, at the sole expense of the Company (except as provided in Article 7.5(b) hereof), a 

Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or applicable successor form) and such other documents, including a prospectus, as may be necessary (in the opinion of both counsel for the Company and counsel for such Majority Holder) in order to comply with the provisions of the Act, so as to permit a public offering and sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof. This right is in addition to the piggyback registration rights provided for under Article 7.3 hereof, provided that the Company shall not be required to effect a Demand Registration pursuant to this Article 7.4 within 180 days of the effective date of a Registration Statement filed by the Company to which the rights provided by Article 7.3 would apply if the Holders were properly notified pursuant to Article 7.3 hereof. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Act so as to permit a public offering and sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof. Once effective, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement until the earlier of (i) the date that all of the Registrable Securities have been sold or (ii) the date the Holders thereof receive an opinion of counsel to the Company that all of the Registrable Securities may be freely traded without registration under the Act under Rule 144 promulgated under the Act or otherwise.

^^The Company covenants and agrees to give written notice of any Demand Registration Request to all Holders of the Registrable Securities within ten (10) business days from the date of the Company’s receipt of any such Demand Registration Request. After receiving notice from the Company as provided in this Article 7.4(b), Holders of Registrable Securities may request the Company to include their Registrable Securities in the Registration Statement to be filed pursuant to Article 7.4(a) hereof by notifying the Company of their decision to have such securities included within fifteen (15) business days of their receipt of the Company’s notice.

^^The term “Majority Holder” as used in Article 7.4 hereof shall mean any Holder or any combination of Holders of Registrable Securities that hold an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (including Shares already issued and Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Warrants) as would constitute a majority of the aggregate number of Shares that are Registrable Securities (including Shares already issued and Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Warrants).

^^Covenants of the Company With Respect to Registration. The Company covenants and agrees as follows:

^^In connection with any registration under Article 7.4 hereof, the Company shall file the Registration Statement as expeditiously as possible, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days following receipt of any demand therefore, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have any such Registration Statement declared effective at the earliest possible time, and shall furnish each Holder of Registrable Securities such number of prospectuses as shall reasonably be requested.

^^The Company shall pay all costs, fees and expenses (other than underwriting fees, discounts and nonaccountable expense allowance applicable to the Registrable Securities and fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Holders of Registrable Securities) in connection with all Registration Statements filed pursuant to Articles 7.3 and 7.4(a) hereof including, without limitation, the Company’s legal and accounting fees, printing expenses, and blue sky fees and expenses and any fees due to the FINRA related to such registration or sale of any of the Registrable Securities.

^^The Company will take all necessary action which may be required in qualifying or registering the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement for offering and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such states as are requested by the Holders of such securities and for obtaining the clearance of FINRA member firms to participate in the distribution of such Registrable Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith to qualify to do business or file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that the same would be materially detrimental to the Company.

^^The Company shall indemnify any Holder of the Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to any Registration Statement and any underwriter or person deemed to be an underwriter under the Act and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter or person deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Section 

^of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), against all loss, claim, damage, expense or liability (including all expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any claim whatsoever) to which any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, arising from such Registration Statement to the same extent and with the same effect as the provisions pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriter as set forth in Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement and to provide for just and equitable contribution as set forth in Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement.

^^Any Holder of Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to a Registration Statement, and such Holder’s successors and assigns, shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify the Company, its officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, against all loss, claim, damage, expense or liability (including all expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any claim whatsoever) to which any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, arising from information furnished by or on behalf of such Holder, or such Holder’s successors or assigns, for specific inclusion in such Registration Statement to the same extent and with the same effect as the provisions pursuant to which the Underwriter has agreed to indemnify the Company as set forth in Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement and to provide for just and equitable contribution as set forth in Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement.

^^Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring any Holder to exercise the Warrants held by such Holder prior to the initial filing of any Registration statement or the effectiveness thereof.

^^If the Company shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Article 7, the Company shall, in addition to any other equitable or other relief available to the Holders of Registrable Securities, be liable for any or all incidental, special and consequential damages sustained by the Holders of Registrable Securities requesting registration of their Registrable Securities.

^^In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company’s Common Stock pursuant to Article 7.3, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters. If the total number of securities to be included in such offering, including the Registrable Securities requested by Holders to be included therein, exceeds the amount of securities that the underwriters determine in their reasonable discretion is compatible with the success of the offering (the “Maximum Number of Securities”), then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering. In the event that the underwriters determine that the Maximum Number of Securities is less than the number of securities to be offered by the Company plus all of the other Registrable Securities requested to be registered by Holders or other security holders with similar registration rights, then the securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated in the following manner: (i) to the Company and, if there is a balance remaining, (ii) to the Holders, provided that if the balance remaining is not sufficient to include in the offering all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the Holders, the number of Registrable Securities to be included for any holder shall be determined pro rata based on the proportionate number of Registrable Securities then held (regardless of whether or not such any such Holder has requested that all such Registrable Securities be included), and, if there is a balance remaining, (iii) to any other shareholders holding similar registration rights as selling security holders. 

^^^The Company shall promptly deliver copies of all correspondence between the Commission and the Company, its counsel or its auditors with respect to the Registration Statement to each Holder of Registrable Securities included for registration in such Registration Statement pursuant to Article 7.3 hereof or Article 7.4 hereof and to the managing underwriter, if any, of the offering in connection with which such Holder’s Registrable Securities are being registered and shall permit each Holder of Registrable Securities and such underwriter to do such reasonable investigation, upon reasonable advance notice, with respect to information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement as it deems reasonably necessary to comply with applicable securities laws or rules of the FINRA. Such investigation shall include access to books, records and properties, and opportunities to discuss the business of the Company with its officers and independent auditors, all to such reasonable extent and at such reasonable times and as often as any such Holder of Registrable Securities or underwriter shall reasonably request; provided, that the Company may require each such Holder or underwriter to enter into reasonable confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with respect to the information contained in or derived from such investigations.

^Adjustments of Exercise Price and Number of Securities. The following adjustments apply to the Exercise Price of the Warrants with respect to the Shares and the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Warrants.

^^Computation of Adjusted Price. In case the Company at any time after the date hereof pays a dividend in shares of Common Stock or makes a distribution in shares of Common Stock, then upon such dividend or distribution, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such dividend or distribution shall forthwith be reduced to a price determined by dividing (a) an amount equal to the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution multiplied by the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, by (b) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or sale. 

^^Subdivision and Combination. In case the Company shall at any time subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Exercise Price shall forthwith be proportionately decreased in the case of subdivision or proportionately increased in the case of combination.

^^Adjustment in Number of Securities. Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to the provisions of this Article 8, the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted to the nearest full number by multiplying a number equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product so obtained by the adjusted Exercise Price.

^^Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger, etc. Subject to Article 12, in case of any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or in the case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, except a change as a result of a subdivision or combination of such shares or a change in par value, as aforesaid), or in the case of a sale or conveyance to another corporation of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Holders shall thereafter have the right to convert this Warrant into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property which the Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive immediately after such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance had this Warrant been converted immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and in any such case, if necessary, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth in this Article 8 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder of this Warrant, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Article 8 shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, in relation to any shares of stock and other securities and property thereafter deliverable on the exercise of this Warrant. The provisions of this Article 8.4 shall similarly apply to successive such reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances. In the event of any conflict between Article 8.4 and Article 12, the latter shall control.

^^Determination of Outstanding Common Shares. For purposes of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock at any one time outstanding shall include: (i) the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of any outstanding options, rights, and warrants, and upon the conversion or exchange of any outstanding convertible or exchangeable securities.

^^Dividends and Other Distributions with Respect to Outstanding Securities. In the event that the Company shall at any time prior to the exercise of all Warrants make any distribution of its assets to holders of its

Common Stock as a liquidating or a partial liquidating dividend, then the Holder of Warrants who exercises its Warrants after the record date for the determination of those Holders of Common Stock entitled to such distribution of assets as a liquidating or partial liquidating dividend shall be entitled to receive for the exercise price per Warrant, in addition to each share of Common Stock, the amount of such distribution (or, at the option of the Company, a sum equal to the value of any such assets at the time of such distribution as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith) which would have been payable to such Holder had he been the Holder of record of the Common Stock receivable upon exercise of his Warrant on the record date for the determination of those entitled to such distribution. At the time of any such dividend or distribution, the Company shall make appropriate reserves to ensure the timely performance of the provisions of this Article 8.6.

^^Subscription Rights for Shares of Common Stock or Other Securities. In the case that the Company or an affiliate of the Company shall at any time after the date hereof and prior to the exercise of all the Warrants issue any rights, warrants or options to subscribe for shares of Common Stock or any other securities of the Company or of such affiliate to all the shareholders of the Company, the Holders of unexercised Warrants on the record date of such issuance of rights, warrants or options shall be entitled, in addition to the shares of Common Stock or other securities receivable upon the exercise of the Warrants, to receive such rights, warrants or options that such Holders would have been entitled to receive had they been, on the record date set by the Company or such affiliate in connection with such issuance of rights, warrants or options, the holders of record of the number of whole shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of their outstanding Warrants. 

^Exchange and Replacement of Warrant Certificates.

Each Warrant Certificate is exchangeable without expense, upon the surrender thereof by the registered Holder at the principal executive office of the Company, for a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and date representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the same number of securities in such denominations as shall be designated by the Holder thereof at the time of such surrender.

Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Warrant Certificate and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon surrender and cancellation of the Warrant Certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor in lieu thereof.

^Elimination of Fractional Interests.

The Company shall not be required to issue certificates representing fractions of Shares upon the exercise of the Warrants, nor shall it be required to issue scrip or pay cash in lieu of fractional interests, it being the intent of the parties that all fractional interests shall be eliminated by rounding any fraction up to the nearest whole number of Shares.

^Reservation and Listing of Securities.

The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the exercise of the Warrants, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be issuable upon the exercise thereof. The Company covenants and agrees that, upon exercise of the Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price therefore, all Shares issuable upon such exercise shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and not subject to the preemptive rights of any shareholder. As long as the Warrants shall be outstanding, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants to be listed on any securities exchange or trading market on which the Common Stock may be listed and/or quoted.

^Sale of the Company. 

^^As used herein, a “Sale of the Company” means (i) any sale (however effected, including without limitation by sale of stock, merger, share exchange or otherwise, including without limitation in a single transaction or series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the outstanding voting stock of the Company, or (ii) any sale, lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, that in neither case, shall a Sale of the Company include a transaction set forth above where the holders of the Company’s voting stock immediately prior to the transaction hold more than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company or its successor following such transaction. 

^^The Company shall give each Holder at least twenty (20) days prior notice of any Sale of the Company. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Warrant will expire at the closing for a Sale of the Company. 

^^Upon receipt of the notice contemplated by Article 12(b) hereof, any Holder may: 

^^^elect (by giving written notice received by the Company no later than five days before the closing of such Sale of the Company and surrendering the Warrants) to receive, upon the closing of the Sale of the Company, (1) the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the closing of the Sale of the Company if the Holder had been, immediately prior to the Sale of the Company, the holder of the number of Shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant less (2) an amount of such securities, cash or property equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Warrants surrendered. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Sale of the Company, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to such alternate consideration it receives pursuant to an election under this Article 12(d);

^^^let the Holders’ Warrants expire in accordance with their terms (subject to Article 12(c)); or

^^^exercise the Holder’s Warrants in accordance with their terms prior to the expiration thereof (subject to the Article 12(c)).

^^Neither this Article 12, nor any notice or election contemplated by this Article 12, shall create any obligation on the Company’s part to consummate any Sale of the Company. If, after any notice or election contemplated by this Article 12 is given, the Company determines not to consummate the Sale of the Company, then the Company shall notify the Holders of such determination, whereupon any preceding notices or elections under this Article 12 regarding such Sale of the Company shall be null and void and of no effect.

^Notices to Warrant Holders.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder or Holders the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder in respect of any meetings of shareholders for the election of directors or any other matter, or as having any rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the Company. If, however, at any time prior to the expiration of the Warrants and their exercise, any of the following events shall occur:

^^the Company shall take a record of the holders of its shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or distribution payable otherwise than in cash, or a cash dividend or distribution payable otherwise than out of current or retained earnings, as indicated by the accounting treatment of such dividend or distribution on the books of the Company; or
