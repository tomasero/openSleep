If Distributor accepts such offer, then such new or additional products shall be added as Products under this Agreement and shall be subject to the terms hereof. In the event Distributor declines such offer or fails to respond to such offer within [***] days thereof, then:

^^^if the new or additional product is in a new category different from the category of any Product previously distributed by Distributor and with a [***] that is distinct from and not confusingly similar to the [***]of any Product previously distributed by Distributor, Supplier shall have the right to sell or distribute such new or additional products in the Territory directly or through third parties; and
