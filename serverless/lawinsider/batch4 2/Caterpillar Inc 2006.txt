\centered **[INSERT GRANT DATE]**

If you were awarded restricted stock units (“RSUs”) on [INSERT GRANT DATE] (the “Grant Date”) pursuant to the [[Organization 1 Name]] 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), this document specifies the material terms and provisions applicable to such award (the “RSU Award”).

**Vesting** 
The RSU Award is subject to a three-year cliff vesting period. The RSU Award will become fully vested on the third anniversary of the Grant Date (the “Vesting Date”). If you terminate employment prior to the Vesting Date for any reason other than long-service separation, disability, death or in connection with a change of control (as described more fully below), the RSU Award will be forfeited.

Upon vesting of the RSU Award, you will receive unrestricted shares of common stock of [[Organization 1 Name]] (the “Company”) equal to the number of RSUs. For example, if you were granted [[Shares 1: Number]] RSUs, you will receive 250 shares of Company common stock as of the Vesting Date, less any shares withheld to satisfy any applicable income and payroll tax withholding requirements.

**Voting Rights** 
During the period between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date (the “Restriction Period), you are not entitled to any voting rights with respect to the RSUs. When shares are actually issued, you then will have full voting rights with respect to those shares.

**Dividends and Other Distributions** 
During the Restriction Period, you will not receive dividends or any other distributions (e.g., dividend equivalents) with respect to the RSU Award. When shares are actually issued, you then will have dividend rights with respect to those shares.

**Termination of Employment** 
Your termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Vesting Date will impact the RSU Award as follows:

·   **Long-Service Separation**

If your employment with the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate terminates by reason of long-service separation (i.e., after attainment of age 55 with 10 or more years of service), to the extent that you were continuously employed by the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate for six months immediately following the Grant Date, your RSU Award will become fully vested and shares of Company common stock will be issued to you as soon as administratively feasible following: (1) the Vesting Date; or (2) the date which is six months following the date of your termination of employment (the “Six-Month Date”), if the Six-Month Date is earlier than the Vesting Date. In no event, however, will the shares be issued later than [[Date 1: Date]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year during which the Vesting Date or the Six-Month Date occurs, as applicable.

·   **Disability**

If your employment with the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate terminates by reason of disability, to the extent that you were continuously employed by the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate for six months immediately following the Grant Date, your RSU Award will become fully vested and shares of Company common stock will be issued to you as soon as administratively feasible following: (1) the Vesting Date; or (2) the date which is six months following the date of your termination of employment (the “Six-Month Date”), if the Six-Month Date is earlier than the Vesting Date. In no event, however, will the shares be issued later than [[Date 1]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year during which the Vesting Date or the Six-Month Date occurs, as applicable.

·   **Death**

If your employment with the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate terminates by reason of death, to the extent that you were continuously employed by the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate for six months immediately following the Grant Date, your RSU Award will become fully vested and shares of Company common stock will be issued to your beneficiary or your estate (as applicable), as soon as administratively feasible following the date of your death but in no event later than [[Date 1]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year during which your death occurs.

·   **Change of Control**

In the event that a change of control of the Company occurs during the Restriction Period and your employment is terminated without cause or for good reason within 12 months of such change of control, then to the extent that you were continuously employed by the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate for six months immediately following the Grant Date, your RSU Award will become fully vested and shares of Company common stock will be issued to you as soon as administratively feasible following: (1) the Vesting Date; or (2) the date which is six months following the date of your termination of employment (the “Six-Month Date”), if the Six-Month Date is earlier than the Vesting Date. In no event, however, will the shares be issued later than [[Date 1]] of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year during which the Vesting Date or the Six-Month Date occurs, as applicable.

·   **Other**

If your employment with the Company and/or any subsidiary or affiliate terminates prior to the Vesting Date for any reason other than long-service separation, disability, death or in connection with a change of control, all RSUs with respect to this RSU Award will lapse and shall be immediately forfeited.

**Transferability of Award** 
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Plan, the RSU Award may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in any way. The RSU Award is not subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt at such, contrary to the provisions of the Plan, will be null and void and without effect. Note that once a RSU Award vests and shares of Company common stock are actually issued, you will have the ability to transfer those shares.

**Designation of Beneficiary** 
If you have not done so already, you are encouraged to designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to whom your benefits under the Plan will be paid upon your death. If you do not designate a beneficiary, any benefits payable pursuant to the Plan upon your death will be paid to your estate.

**Administration of the Plan**
