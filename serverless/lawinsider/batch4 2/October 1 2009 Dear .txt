^**Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation of Customers/Clients**.

^^**Access to Proprietary Information**. You acknowledge that the special relationship of trust and confidence between you, [[Organization 1 Name]], and its clients and customers creates a high risk and opportunity for the misappropriation of the

You further acknowledge and agree that it is fair and reasonable for [[Organization 1 Name]] to take steps to protect itself from the risk of such misappropriation.

This restriction is limited to business partners with whom you had material contact during your employment for the purpose of performing your job duties at the Company.

^^**Reasonable Restrictions**. You agree that the restrictions set forth above are ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement, are supported by independent valuable consideration, and that the limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained by this Section 8 are reasonable and acceptable, and do not impose any greater restraint than is reasonably necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of [[Organization 1 Name]]. You agree that if, at some later date, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the non-competition and/or the non-solicitation provisions set forth in this Section 8 do not me et the criteria set forth in applicable law, this Section 8 may be reformed by the court and enforced to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.

^^**Breach**. If you are found to have violated any of the provisions of this Section 8, you agree that the restrictive period of each covenant so violated shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation by him.

to immediate injunctive relief, either by temporary or permanent injunction, to prevent such a violation.

^**Notification of Prospective Employment**.
