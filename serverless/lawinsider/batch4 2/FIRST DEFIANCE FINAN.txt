^^**No Impact on Benefits**. Awards are not compensation for purposes of calculating a Participant’s rights under any employee benefit plan that does not specifically require the inclusion of Awards in calculating benefits. 

^^**Rights as a Shareholder**. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in a related Award Agreement, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares covered by an Award unless and until the Participant becomes the record holder of such Shares.

^^Awards granted pursuant to the Plan that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, or that are subject to Section 409A but for which an exception from Section 409A of the Code applies, are intended to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Plan shall be interpreted, administered and operated accordingly.

Such Award, or portion thereof, shall be paid or distributed on the first (1st) business day of the seventh (7th) month following such separation from service.

^^**Savings Clause**. In the event that any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the
