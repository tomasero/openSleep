Dear Mr. Orellana: 

**Re: BINDING STANDBY CREDIT FACILITY**

Subject to acceptance of, and fulfillment of the terms, conditions, and preconditions contained herein, [[Organization 1 Name]].(SR) (the "**Lender**") offers this binding standby credit facility (the "**Facility**") to [[Organization 2 Name]] (the "**Borrower**") on the terms specified below. 

^The Lender's obligations under this Facility are subject to the following conditions:

^^Completion on or prior to [[Date 2: Date]] of a private placement (the "**Equity Financing**") by the Borrower resulting in gross proceeds raised of a minimum of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] in US funds.

^^Completion of a business combination (the “**Reverse Merger**”) between the Borrower and a U.S. public reporting company (“PubCo”) whose securities are quoted on the over-the- counter bulletin board (“**OTCBB**”) or on a recognized North American national securities exchange (an “**Exchange**,” and together with the OTCBB, a “**Recognized Market**”) on or before [[Date 2]].

^^All of the representations and warranties of the Borrower hereunder shall be true and correct as of the date hereof.

^^The Lender shall be satisfied that any debt outstanding to the Lender, and any security granted in connection therewith, ranks in priority to any amount owing or outstanding or any security granted to any other person, corporation, trust, partnership or other entity.

^^The Lender shall have received such customary legal opinions from counsel as to the validity and enforceability of the obligations created hereunder.

^^The Lender shall have received audited financial statements or such other documentation as the Lender may deem necessary in its sole discretion, indicating that the [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the free cash flow from the operations of the Borrower will be sufficient to enable the Borrower to make all payments agreed to in repayment of any Advance, and that there are sufficient assets available with current provable values to collateralize the amount of any Advance (including any other Advances then outstanding).

^^The Lender, the Borrower and PubCo shall enter into a loan agreement reflecting the terms and conditions set forth herein, and such subsidiary and parent guarantees of the obligations of the Lender as the Lender may require, all of which documentation shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender and to its counsel, to the Borrower and PubCo (collectively, the "**Loan Documents**"). The Loan Documents will be consistent with this letter agreement and will provide for customary events of default and remedies thereupon.

^The Facility is for a maximum amount of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in U.S. Dollar funds, and is available as a stand by facility for a term of one year from the date hereof, after which time it will expire; provided, however, that if the Borrower has requested an advance from the Lender hereunder (an “**Advance**”) during such term then the Lender shall remain obligated, subject to the terms hereof, to provide such Advance even though the provision of such Advance may occur after such term.

^Upon the closing of the Equity Financing, the Lender shall have earned its set up fee, payable in the form of: (i) [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of common stock (the "**Shares**") of PubCo, which shares are to be issued concurrently with the Equity Financing; and (ii) one year common stock purchase warrants (the "**Warrants**") having an exercise price equal to the price per share of common stock paid by investors in the Equity Financing and therefore exercisable for [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of PubCo (subject to equitable adjustment for stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations and the like), which Warrants are to be issued concurrently with the Equity Financing, in form satisfactory to the Lender. The Shares and Warrants will be Shares and Warrants of the Borrower’s then parent, PubCo. The Warrants shall contain a provision for “cashless exercise” and shall be effective for a period of one (1) year from the date of issuance.

^Any Advance shall be subject to the following fees and interest, and for greater certainty, fees will be paid to the Lender on the making of any Advance, and may, at the Lender's option be withheld therefrom, and interest shall be calculated and compounded monthly:

**Funds advanced**   **Lender's fee**   **Securities of PubCo to be issued (collectively with**
**the shares and the warrants the "Securities")**

First $[[USD Value 3: Number]]   [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of Advance   [[Percentage 2]]% one year common stock purchase warrant priced at the 10-day moving average trading price of the underlying securities.

Second $[[USD Value 3]]   [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of Advance   [[Percentage 3]]% one year common stock purchase warrant priced at the 10-day moving average trading price of the underlying securities.

Third $[[USD Value 3]]   [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of Advance   [[Percentage 4]]% one year common stock purchase warrant priced at the 10-day moving average trading price of the underlying securities.

^The funds advanced under the Facility may be used solely for the purpose of operating the existing business of the Borrower and any related businesses of the Borrower or PubCo or for general working capital purposes of Borrower or PubCo.

^If the Borrower wishes to receive an Advance from the Lender, it shall give the Lender a minimum of ninety (90) days' notice, and the Lender shall, subject to Sections 1, on the first business day after the ninetieth (90th) day of such written notice provide an Advance in United States Dollars and in immediately available funds to an account designated by the Borrower.
