Case No. CL 08-1144

\centered **STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT**

[[Company]] (“FBR” or the “Company”), now known as [[Address 2: Address]] Corp.; (ii) defendants [[Individual Defendants]], [[Party 5]], [[Party 6]], [[Party 7]], [[Party 8]], [[Party 9]], [[Company0]], [[Company1]], [[Company2]], [[Company3]], [[Company4]], III, and [[Company5]] (the “Individual Defendants”); and (iii) nominal party FBR (collectively with the Individual Defendants defined as “Defendants”). The Stipulation is intended by the Parties to fully, finally, and forever resolve, discharge, and settle the Released Claims (as defined in ¶1.19), upon and subject to the terms and conditions hereof.

^^^**INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND**

On or about [[Date 2: Date]], pursuant to Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-672.1(B), Plaintiffs sent a letter (the “Demand”) to [[Individual Defendants]], FBR’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board of Directors, demanding that FBR’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) take action to recover from certain officers and directors of FBR the damages allegedly sustained by FBR as a result of alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by those officers and directors. On [[Date 3: Date]], Plaintiffs filed a “Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint” (the “Complaint”) captioned Kornfeld, et al. v. Billings, et al., Case No. CL-08-1144 (Va. Cir. Ct.), derivatively on behalf of FBR against (1) certain FBR officers and former officers and (2) certain FBR Directors and former Directors.

In response to the Demand, the Company formed a Special Litigation Committee (the “First SLC”), and, on [[Date 4: Date]], (1) FBR moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-672.4(A) and (2) the Individual Defendants filed a demurrer to the Complaint contending, inter alia, that (1) FBR’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation shielded defendants from the asserted claims, and (2) Plaintiffs had failed to plead any material facts that, if proven, would show that FBR’s current and former directors failed to discharge their duties in accordance with their good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss and the demurrer and filed a motion to compel certain discovery related to the First SLC’s investigation and findings. On [[Date 5: Date]], the Honorable [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]] heard argument on the motion to dismiss, the demurrer, and Plaintiffs’ motion to compel. The Court denied the motion to dismiss with leave to renew following limited discovery, and overruled the demurrer. The Court ordered the Parties to confer regarding the timing and scope of that discovery. Thereafter, consistent with the Court’s rulings, the Parties began to negotiate the timing and scope of discovery. In addition, the Parties began a discussion regarding a potential resolution of the claims made in the Complaint, and, in connection therewith, on [[Date 6: Date]], Plaintiffs sent a letter to FBR that outlined a potential structure to resolve the litigation and which included, inter alia, specific changes to FBR’s compensation policies and procedures as well as additional measures that Plaintiffs believed would improve FBR’s overall corporate governance processes and procedures. The Parties continued these preliminary settlement discussions for several months while also negotiating the scope of discovery to be produced in connection with the First SLC’s investigation and findings, and, in connection therewith, the Company provided Plaintiffs with certain non-public documents. The Parties were unable to resolve the claims made in the Complaint, and, during the course of those discussions, the Company informed Plaintiffs that the Company would not be renewing its motion to dismiss the Complaint under Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-672.4(A).

Thereafter, the Parties conferred about a litigation schedule, and, in connection therewith, on [[Date 7: Date]], Plaintiffs filed their “Amended Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint” (the “Amended Complaint”). The Amended Complaint alleges, on behalf of FBR, claims against (1) certain FBR officers and former officers and (2) certain FBR Directors and former Directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and corporate waste. The allegations arise out of certain decisions by the Compensation Committee of the Board in 2007 and 2008 concerning executive compensation. On [[Date 8: Date]], FBR filed an answer to the Amended Complaint. On the same day, the Individual Defendants filed a demurrer to the Amended Complaint, contending, inter alia, that (1) FBR’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation shield defendants from the asserted claims, and (2) Plaintiffs had failed to plead any material facts that, if proven, would show that FBR’s current and former directors failed to discharge their duties in accordance with their good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation. On or about [[Date 9: Date]], Plaintiffs served a request for production of documents on the Company and the Individual Defendants, to which the Company and the Individual Defendants responded on [[Date 10: Date]], thereafter providing Plaintiffs certain responsive, non-public documents.

On or about [[Date 11: Date]], pursuant to Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-672.1(B), Plaintiffs sent another letter (the “Second Demand”) to [[Individual Defendants]] demanding that the Board take action to recover from certain directors of FBR the damages allegedly sustained by FBR as a result of alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by those directors. The Second Demand alleged, inter alia, that certain FBR directors and former directors had breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by failing to seek a premium payment for the sale of the Company’s majority stake in [[Organization 2 Name]], a former wholly-owned subsidiary of FBR. In response to the Second Demand, the Company formed a Special Litigation Committee (the “Second SLC”). Beginning in [[Date 12: Date]], following the completion of the Second SLC’s investigation, counsel for Plaintiffs and counsel for the Second SLC had several telephonic meetings concerning the Second SLC’s investigation and its findings. Thereafter, the Second SLC provided Plaintiffs with certain non-public information concerning its investigation and findings including the Second SLC report which concluded that the allegations in the Second Demand were without merit and that the Company should not seek to pursue any of the claims set forth in the Second Demand.

In mid-[[Date 12]], the Parties, by and through their respective counsel, recommenced discussions regarding a potential resolution of the Action (as defined in ¶1.1). Through these discussions, the Parties agreed to pursue mediation before Mr. [[Person 2 First Name]] [[Person 2 Last Name]], Esq. (the “Mediator”). On [[Date 13: Date]], the Parties conducted an all-day mediation session before the Mediator. After the conclusion of the mediation session, and with the substantial assistance and oversight of the Mediator, the Parties continued their arm’s-length settlement negotiations to resolve the Action and ultimately reached an agreement-in-principle to resolve the Action, as detailed in a Memorandum of Understanding dated [[Date 14: Date]]. Thereafter, and as detailed further in Section V.2.1.A, the Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee regarding the adoption of a new compensation plan. Plaintiffs and their counsel provided input to the Compensation Committee and their experts and ultimately approved the new compensation plan, which the Compensation Committee subsequently adopted on [[Date 15: Date]].

One of the three components of the new compensation plan is long-term incentive compensation and in connection with the Company’s 2010 Annual Meeting, the Company requested and advised that FBR’s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Company’s 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”). Following the Company’s 2010 Annual Meeting held on [[Date 16: Date]], and as disclosed by the Company in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on [[Date 17: Date]], [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the votes were cast in favor of the Incentive Plan. However, the total votes cast on that proposal constituted [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the shares entitled to vote on the proposal. As a result, the number of votes cast on the proposal was below the number required for approval as set forth in Section 312 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, which states that the proposal must be approved by a majority of votes cast on the proposal, provided that the total votes cast on the proposal represents over [[Percentage 3: Number]]% in interest of all shares entitled to vote on the proposal. The Company intends to seek approval of the Incentive Plan in connection with the Company’s 2011 Annual Meeting. Furthermore, as a result of the foregoing, no employee covered under the Incentive Plan shall receive any award pursuant to such plan that he or she may have been entitled to during fiscal year 2010. Last, to the extent that an employee would have been entitled to long term incentive compensation in fiscal year 2010 under the Incentive Plan had it been adopted, the Compensation Committee will not consider the loss of such compensation as a factor when making its decision with respect to that employee’s total compensation for fiscal year 2010.

^^^**CLAIMS OF PLAINTIFFS AND BENEFITS OF SETTLEMENT**

Plaintiffs believe that the claims they have asserted in the Action on behalf of FBR have merit. However, counsel for Plaintiffs recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against Defendants through trial and through appeals. Plaintiffs’ Counsel (as defined in ¶1.16) also have taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Counsel for Plaintiffs also are mindful of the inherent problems of proof and possible defenses to the claims asserted in the Action or which may be asserted. Based on their evaluation, which was formed, in part, on the receipt and review of non-public documents and information, Plaintiffs and their counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of FBR and its shareholders and that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation confers substantial benefits upon FBR and its shareholders.

^^^**INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING AND LIABILITY**

Individual Defendants have denied and continue to deny each and all of the claims andcontentions alleged by Plaintiffs in the Action. Individual Defendants believe that they have substantial defenses to the allegations asserted, including that FBR’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation shield Individual Defendants from Plaintiffs’ allegations, and that Plaintiffs cannot show that FBR’s current or former officers and directors failed to discharge their duties in accordance with their good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation. Nonetheless, Individual Defendants also have taken into account the uncertainty and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Action. Individual Defendants, therefore, have determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Action be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation. Those Individual Defendants who serve on FBR’s Board believe that the settlement set forth in this Stipulation confers substantial benefits upon FBR and its shareholders, and is in the best interests of FBR and its shareholders.

^^^**POSITION OF NOMINAL DEFENDANT FBR**

Nominal Defendant FBR has determined that the settlement set forth in the Stipulation is in the best interests of FBR and its shareholders and that the settlement confers substantial benefits upon FBR and its shareholders. The Nominal Defendant, therefore, has determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Action be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation.

^**TERMS OF THE STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT**

NOW, THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IS STIPULATED AND AGREED by and among Plaintiffs (for themselves and derivatively on behalf of FBR), the Individual Defendants, and FBR, by and through their respective counsel or attorneys of record, that, subject to Court approval, the Action and the Released Claims shall be finally and fully compromised, settled and released, and the Action shall be dismissed with prejudice, as to all Parties, upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, as follows.

In connection therewith, the Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee regarding an appropriate compensation plan which included identifying a peer group of companies to reflect appropriate comparable companies and structured a compensation policy that is, in substantial part, performance-based and does not allow the revision of any bonus formula for a given fiscal year once it has been established for that fiscal year.

^ELECTION OF A NEW INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

^By the end of calendar year 2010, the Nominating and Governance Committee will select and appoint a new independent director to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors, which new independent director shall serve on the Compensation Committee.

If elected, that director shall continue to serve on the Compensation Committee.

^CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SUCCESSION PLAN

^The Board shall adopt a policy to ensure the stability of the Company in the event of departure of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”).

^Releases 

^^Upon the Effective Date, as defined in ¶6.1, FBR, Plaintiffs (acting on their own behalf and derivatively on behalf of FBR), and each FBR shareholder (solely in their capacity as an FBR shareholder) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Final Order and Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever released, relinquished, and discharged the Released Claims against the Released Persons and any and all claims (including Unknown Claims) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with, the defense, settlement, or resolution of the Action against the Released Persons, provided, that nothing herein shall in any way impair or restrict the rights of any Party to enforce the terms of the Stipulation.

As a result of those negotiations, FBR has agreed to pay Plaintiffs’ Counsel, as part of the Settlement and subject to court approval, a Fee and Expense Award in an amount of $[[USD Value 1: Number]]

Upon the Effective Date, the Fee and Expense Award, with any interest and as modified, if at all, by any further order by the Court or on appeal, will be released to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.

^^The allowance or disallowance by the Court of any award of attorneys’ fees or expenses will be considered by the Court following approval of this Stipulation and separately from the Court’s consideration of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the Settlement. Any order or proceeding relating solely to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses (including costs and disbursements), or any appeal from any order relating thereto or reversal or modification thereof, shall have no effect on the Settlement and shall not operate to terminate or cancel this Stipulation or to affect or delay the finality of the Order and Final Judgment approving this Stipulation.

Chief Executive Officer 
[[Address 2: Address]] Corp.

[[Address 9: Address]]  

**Re: Shareholder Demand**  
Dear Mr. Billings:  
This firm represents Mr. [[Stockholders]] and Mr. [[Party 3]] (collectively, the “Stockholders”), who collectively hold approximately [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of common stock of [[Address 2: Address]] Corp. (“[[Address 10: Address]] “Company”) and are plaintiffs in a pending shareholder derivative action captioned Kornfeld, et al. v. Billings, et al., Civil Action No. 08-1144 (Circuit Ct. [[Address 11: Address]], VA) brought on behalf of [[Address 12: Address]] on behalf of the Stockholders to demand that the Board of Directors of [[Address 13: Address]](the “Board”) take action to remedy breaches of fiduciary duties and waste of corporate assets by the directors of the Company, as described herein.

As you are aware, by reason of their positions at [[Address 14: Address]] of their ability to control the business and corporate affairs of [[Address 15: Address]] and officers of the Company owe [[Address 16: Address]] shareholders the fiduciary obligations of good faith, loyalty, and due care and are required to use their utmost ability to control and manage [[Address 17: Address]] fair, just, honest and equitable manner. The Stockholders believe that [[Address 18: Address]] [[Individual Defendants]], [[Company2]], [[Party 9]], [[Company1]], [[Company3]], [[Company4]], III, [[Company5]], [[Party 5]], Jr., and [[Company0]] (collectively, the “Directors”) violated these core fiduciary duty principles, causing [[Address 19: Address]] damages.

Prior to [[Date 21: Date]], [[Address 20: Address]] wholly-owned subsidiary [[Organization 11 Name]] (“TRS”), owned [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of common stock of [[Organization 2 Name]] (“FBRCM”), which represented approximately [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of FBRCM’s outstanding equity. In connection with its majority ownership of FBRCM, [[Address 21: Address]] party to, among other things, (i) a [[Date 22: Date]] Voting Agreement (“Voting Agreement”) pursuant to which [[Address 22: Address]] right to, among other things, designate for election or appointment to the Board of Directors of FBRCM three non-independent and four independent directors; and (ii) a [[Date 22]] Governance Agreement (“Governance Agreement”) pursuant to which [[Address 23: Address]], among other things, a right of first offer and right of first refusal with respect to the purchase of certain shares of FBRCM common stock owned by certain affiliates of Crestview Partners.

On [[Date 21]], [[Address 24: Address]] a Stock Repurchase Agreement with FBRCM pursuant to which [[Address 25: Address]], sold to FBRCM [[Shares 3: Number]] shares of FBRCM common stock at $[[USD Value 4: Number]] per share, the [[Date 21]] closing price of FBRCM’s common stock on the Nasdaq stock exchange, for an aggregate sale price of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] [[Address 26: Address]] of these shares reduced its ownership stake in FBRCM from approximately [[Percentage 6]]% to approximately [[Percentage 7: Number]]%. In connection with the Stock Repurchase Agreement, [[Address 24: Address]] certain ancillary agreements (“Ancillary Agreements”) pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Voting Agreement was amended to, among other things, reduce [[Address 27: Address]] to designate directors for election or appointment to the Board of Directors of FBRCM from three non-independent and four independent directors to two non-independent and zero independent directors; and (ii) the Governance Agreement was terminated.

In exchange for giving up its majority control of FBRCM and its rights pursuant to the Voting Agreement and Governance Agreement, [[Address 28: Address]] receive any premium to the market price of FBRCM’s common stock. Moreover, there is no indication that the Board of [[Address 29: Address]] special committee of disinterested and independent directors to negotiate and approve the Stock Repurchase Agreement and Ancillary Agreements nor took other necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that the Stock Repurchase Agreement and Ancillary Agreements were fair to [[Address 30: Address]] of, among other things, clear conflicts of interest on the part of [[Individual Defendants]] and other [[Address 31: Address]] directors. The Stockholders contend that the Directors, aided and abetted by FBRCM and the Board of Directors of FBRCM, breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets by approving and entering into the Stock Repurchase Agreement and Ancillary Agreements on unfair terms and pursuant to an unfair process. As a direct and proximate result of the Directors’ breaches of fiduciary duties, [[Address 32: Address]] damages, including, but not limited to, the loss of a premium on the sale of [[Shares 3]] shares of FBRCM common stock.

On behalf of the Stockholders, I hereby demand that the Board take action to recover the amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of the misconduct alleged herein and to prevent this type of misconduct from recurring in the future. If within a reasonable period of time after receipt of this letter the Board has not taken action as demanded herein, the Stockholders will bring derivative claims on behalf of [[Address 33: Address]] relief.

Sincerely,

\centered **NOTICE OF SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE ACTION,**

\centered **HEARING THEREON, AND RIGHT TO APPEAR**

**IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL CURRENT HOLDERS OF FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, [[Organization 1 Name]] (NOW KNOWN AS [[Address 41: Address]], INC.) COMMON STOCK AS OF [[Date 1]] (“CURRENT FBR SHAREHOLDERS”), (EXCLUDING DEFENDANTS) AND THEIR SUCCESSORS-IN-INTEREST. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ACTION IS NOT A “CLASS ACTION” AND NO INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER HAS THE RIGHT TO BE COMPENSATED AS RESULT OF THIS SETTLEMENT.**

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the above-captioned shareholder derivative action (the “Action”) is being settled. The terms of the proposed settlement of the Action (the “Settlement”) are set forth in a Stipulation of Settlement dated August 9, 2010 (the “Stipulation”). This summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the text of the Stipulation, which has been filed with the Court. 

All capitalized terms herein have the same meanings as set forth in the Stipulation.

The Action was brought derivatively on behalf of Friedman, Billings, [[Organization 1 Name]] (“FBR” or the “Company”) against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, arising from, among other things, compensation to certain defendants in 2007 and 2008. The Settlement also involves a separate litigation demand by Plaintiffs demanding that the Board take action related to alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by certain directors, arising from the Company’s sale of its majority stake in [[Organization 2 Name]]. All of the defendants deny each and every allegation in the Action and the demand.

The terms of the Settlement set forth in the Stipulation include the adoption and/or implementation of a variety of corporate governance measures related to, among other things, the Company’s compensation practices and procedures, including but not limited to: (1) the adoption of a new compensation plan; (2) the appointment of a new independent director; (3) the adoption of a compensation “clawback” policy; (4) the adoption of Officer and Director stock ownership guidelines; (5) the adoption of a Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan; and (6) the creation of a Conflict Committee to consider any related party transactions. The Settlement also provides for FBR to pay Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s attorneys’ fees and expenses in the amount of $[[USD Value 3]] (the “Fee Award”), subject to Court approval.

IF YOU ARE A CURRENT OWNER OF FBR COMMON STOCK, YOUR RIGHTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY PROCEEDINGS IN THE LITIGATION.

On __________, 2010, at ___ __.m., a hearing (the “Settlement Hearing”) will be held at the Circuit Court of the State of Virginia, County of [[Address 13: Address]](the “Court”), [[Address 35: Address]], to determine: (1) whether the terms of the Settlement should be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate; (2) whether the Action should be dismissed on the merits and with prejudice; (3) whether the agreed-to Fee Award described above should be awarded, and (4) such other matters as may be necessary or proper in the circumstances.

Any current FBR stockholder that objects to the Settlement of the Action shall have a right to appear and to be heard at the Settlement Hearing, and may enter an appearance through counsel of such Person’s own choosing and at such Person’s own expense or may appear on their own. However, no Person other than Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Defendants’ counsel in the Action shall be heard at the Settlement Hearing unless no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the Settlement Hearing, such Person has filed with the Court and delivered to counsel for the Parties a written notice of objection, signed as authorized by the objecting shareholder, setting forth their ground for opposing the Settlement, and proof of both their status as a current FBR stockholder and the dates of stock ownership in FBR. Any objecting shareholder must also file with the Court and deliver to all counsel in the Action (listed below), copies of any documents, exhibits, affidavits, or other evidence the shareholder will rely upon in support of his or her objection. Only current FBR stockholders who have filed and delivered valid and timely written notices of objection will be entitled to be heard at the Settlement Hearing unless the Court orders otherwise.

If you wish to object to the Settlement, you must file a written objection setting forth the grounds for such an objection with the Court on or before __________, 2010, with service on the following parties:

[[Person 4 First Name]] [[Person 4 Last Name]] [[Organization 3 Name]] & Check, LLP 280 King of Prussia Road Radnor, PA 19087   [[Person 11 First Name]] [[Person 11 Last Name]] [[Organization 9 Name]] [[Address 38: Address]]

[[Person 10 First Name]] [[Person 10 Last Name]] [[Organization 8 Name]] [[Address 37: Address]]

Any Person who fails to object in the manner described above shall be deemed to have waived the right to object (including any right of appeal) and shall be forever barred from raising such objection in this or any other action or proceeding, unless the Court orders otherwise.
