**Pivotal Trial Data Summary**

Augment Bone Graft met the primary endpoint of the study  statistically significant non-inferiority to autograft per CT fusion rate at 24 wks 

^wk non-union rate (**[[Percentage 57]]%** augment vs **[[Percentage 58]]%** autograft) is consistent with the published literature, despite high percentage of patients ([[Percentage 72: Number]]%) with risk factors for poor healing 

Radiographic, clinical and functional assessments at 24 and 52 weeks demonstrate comparability to autograft, the standard adjunct for bone healing in reconstructive orthopedic surgery 

^week data support reliability of fusion for both Augment and autograft groups (no patients regressed between 24&52 weeks)

**Discussion/Conclusions**

Harvesting autograft is a time-consuming procedure; which is associated with potential complications and prolonged post- operative patient pain 

Augment Bone Graft treated patients experienced fewer serious adverse events and were spared the pain and morbidity of bone graft harvest 

There are few materials that have been shown to be equivalent to autograft in large RCT studies  none indicated for use in foot and ankle surgery 

The results from this study establish Augment Bone Graft as a safe an effective alternative to autograft in hindfoot and ankle surgery
