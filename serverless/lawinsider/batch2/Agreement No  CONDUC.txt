If any channels break out in the process of registering, the work may be continued if in an active arrangement the number of defect channels do not exceed 1 for 80 active channels. However, such defect channels should be disposed at the earliest opportunity.

The representative of the Company should appreciate the signal-noise relation at the site and may decrease requirements.

**6.2.3 Defective routs.** 
^rout is considered to be defective at one of the following conditions:

^incorrect polarity;

^dead route, pulsatile or its RMS differs from average value;

Such physical observations worked out in accordance with project requirements may be picked off at the cost of the Company (at the discretion of the representative of the Company), if obtained results do not satisfy stated geological tasks. Decision on pick-off shall be taken with such degree of cooperativeness to exclude resetting of detector lines required for registration; otherwise the Contractor may refuse from pick-off.

Should the representative of the Company take decision of pick-off one or several SP and quality appears to be the same as defective and deemed to be resulted from seismic conditions, the Company shall pay for both defective and picked-off SP.

To comply with such requirement the group base may be decreased up to dotted grouping.

**6.2.7. Noises**  
The station shall be positioned as far as possible from seismic profile to minimize noise.

Transport of registering team shall move as minimum at 100 meters from positioning of seismic profile, as possible and it is necessary to turn off engines when stopping within the territory of active line for lasting period of time.

Maximal permissible level of random noises shall not exceed stated level agreed above. The operators shall notify the representative of the Company about exceeding of the noise level.

Presence of permanent and inremovable ambient level, for example from power lines, drilling works, water flows, etc. shall not be a cause of rejecting of SP, if all other requirements are met. Decision on registration or skip of such SP shall be taken with permission of the representative of the Company.
