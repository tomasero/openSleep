The Option Exercise Price is agreed to be at least [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date. 

^^The Option is granted pursuant to the Plan, a copy of which the Participant acknowledges having received. All terms, provisions and conditions applicable to the Option set forth in the Plan and not set forth herein are hereby [[Party 1]] by reference herein. To the extent any provision hereof is inconsistent with a provision of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. All capitalized terms that are used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined in Section 9 hereof or elsewhere herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 

^Limitations on Transfer of Options; Management Shareholders Agreement

^^The Option shall be subject to the limitations on transfer set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan. 

^^The issuance of any Shares pursuant to any exercise of the Option provided for hereby is conditioned upon the Participant’s execution and delivery of the Management Shareholders Agreement, and no such issuance shall be made prior to such execution and delivery. All Shares issued pursuant to any exercise of the Option shall be subject to the limitations on transfer and other restrictions set forth in the Management Shareholders Agreement. 

^Right to Exercise; Procedure for Exercise

^^The Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, prior to expiration to the extent it is vested. The Grant Notice contains the Option vesting schedule (the “Vesting Schedule”). In the event of the termination of the Participant’s Service with the Company, the Option shall not vest with respect to any further Shares beyond those with respect to which it has vested as of the effective date of such termination of Service except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 4. 

^^Notwithstanding Section 3(a), the Option will become fully vested upon the consummation of a sale of all of the shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, whether by sale, merger, amalgamation, combination, consolidation or similar business transaction. 

^^The exercise procedures set forth in Section 5.6 of the Plan shall govern the exercise of the Option. 

^Term and Expiration

^^Basic Term. Subject to earlier termination pursuant to the terms hereof, the Option shall expire on the expiration date set forth in the Grant Notice, which date is 10 years after the Effective Date of Grant. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties, in no event shall the Option be exercisable after the expiration date set forth in the Grant Notice. 

^^Expiration Following Termination of Service. 

^^^*Termination for Material Breach*. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties, if the Participant’s Service with the Company is terminated at any time by the Company for Material Breach,  the Option shall cease to be exercisable, whether or not vested, and shall be terminated upon the effective date of such termination; provided, however, that if the Participant is a resident of California at the time of his or her termination and the reason for the Participant’s termination would not constitute “cause” within the meaning of California law, the Option shall, to the extent vested and exercisable at the time of termination, remain exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days following the effective date of such termination, after which time the Option shall terminate and cease to be exercisable. For the avoidance of doubt, vesting of the Option prior to the second anniversary of the Grant Date would occur only under Section 3(b) while the Participant is in Service.

^^^*Voluntary Termination Within Two Years of Grant Date*. If the Participant’s Service with the Company is terminated by the Participant pursuant to a Voluntary Termination on or prior to the second anniversary of the Grant Date, the Option shall cease to be exercisable, whether or not vested, and shall be terminated upon the effective date of such termination; provided, however, that subject to the vesting requirements and provisions set forth in Section 3, the Option shall, to the extent vested and exercisable at the time of termination, remain exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days following the effective date of such termination, after which time the Option shall cease to be exercisable, whether or not vested, and shall be terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, vesting of the Option prior to the second anniversary of the Grant Date would occur only under Section 3(b) while the Participant is in Service.

^^^*Expiration Following Termination for Other Than Material Breach; Voluntary Termination After the Second Anniversary of Grant Date.* If the Participant’s Service with the Company is terminated (x) at any time by the Company for no reason or any reason other than Material Breach or (y) by the Participant pursuant to a Voluntary Termination after the second anniversary of the Grant Date, subject to terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the extent vested and exercisable at the time of termination, the Option shall remain exercisable through the expiration date of the Option set forth in the Grant Notice. Any portion of the Option that is not vested and exercisable as of the date of termination shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, continue to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice (and, if applicable, in accordance with Section 3(b)) and any such portion which becomes vested after the date of the Participant’s termination will remain exercisable through the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Grant Notice.

^^^*Expiration Following Death or Disability of the Participant.* If the Participant dies or if the Participant’s Service is terminated as a result of Disability, in either case before the expiration of the Option, the Option may be exercised by the Participant (or, in the case of his death, by the personal representative of the Participant or by any person who has acquired this Option directly from the Participant by will, bequest or inheritance), but only to the extent that, and on the same terms that, the Option was vested and exercisable upon the Participant’s termination of Service. For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of the Option which was not vested and exercisable at the time of the Participant’s death or termination of Service as a result of Disability shall thereafter become vested and exercisable.

^Company’s Right to Repurchase Shares. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, in the event that the (x) Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in conduct in violation of this Agreement, or (y) the Participant’s Service with the Company has been terminated, all or any portion of any Shares issued to the Participant upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to repurchase as described in this Section 5. The purchase price for any Shares to be purchased pursuant to this Section 5 is payable, at the option of the Company, in cash, Three Year Junior Notes or a combination thereof.

^^Call of Shares Upon Termination for Other Than Material Breach; Voluntary Termination after the Third Anniversary of Grant Date. If the Participant’s Service with the Company is terminated (x) at any time by the Company for no reason or any reason other than Material Breach or (y) by the Participant pursuant to a Voluntary Termination after the third anniversary of the Grant Date, subject to applicable law, including the Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, the Company may repurchase all or any portion of any Shares issued to the Participant upon exercise of the Option at a purchase price per share equal to the Repurchase Price per Share. 

^^Expiration of Repurchase Option. If the Company does not deliver to the Participant a written notice (a “Call Notice”) of its intention to exercise the call rights set forth in this Section 5 within six months of the later of termination of Service of the Participant or violation of this Agreement by the Participant, as applicable, or the date of issuance of the Shares with respect to which any such call right is exercised, such call rights will expire. This Section 5 shall terminate upon the consummation of a sale of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, whether by sale, merger, amalgamation, combination, consolidation or similar business transaction. 

^^Restrictions on Payments by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all repurchases pursuant to this Section 5, including issuances of and payments by the Company on the Three Year Junior Notes, shall be subject to (i) applicable restrictions contained in any applicable law, (ii) restrictions contained in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ debt and equity financing agreements, including the Credit Agreement and the Indenture, each as amended and in effect from time to time, and any Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Three Year Junior Notes) and (iii) the availability of cash to make any lump sum cash payments. If any such restrictions or unavailability prohibit the repurchase of Shares hereunder which the Company is otherwise entitled or required to make, the Company may make such repurchases as soon as it is permitted to do so under such restrictions. 

^^Timing Considerations. In the event the Company makes payments in cash pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5, such payments will be made within ninety (90) days of the date of the call. In the event that the Company makes payments in Three Year Junior Notes, such notes will be executed and delivered within ninety (90) days of the date of the call.
