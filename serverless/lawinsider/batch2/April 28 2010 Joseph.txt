This letter confirms our mutual understanding of your employment as an elected officer and Vice President and President, Aftermarket and Trailer with [[Organization 1 Name]] (“Company”).

If you accept the terms of this letter, please return a signed copy to me. 

**Base Salary**   
You will continue to receive your current monthly base salary in accordance with Company payroll practices. Your performance will be assessed at the end of each performance year against both your annual goals and objectives and the Company’s performance. Based on your performance and the Company’s performance, your salary will be reviewed each year by the Compensation and [[Organization 2 Name]] of the Board of Directors (“Committee”) which may, at its discretion, adjust your base salary as a direct result of your past performance. Any annual adjustments are typically effective the following February. (Nothing herein shall preclude the Chairman and CEO from effecting a downward adjustment of your salary if in his judgment and the judgment of the Compensation Committee, such adjustment is warranted as a result of the Company’s poor performance or other economic/business related factors.) 

**Annual Incentive Plans**   
You will be eligible to participate in the Company’s annual incentive plan (Incentive Compensation Plan or ICP) on a basis consistent with those of comparable executives. Your target award will be based upon the Incentive Compensation Plan target percentage for your position within the Company multiplied by your base salary at the end of the fiscal year. Actual award payments will be in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Compensation Plan and may be adjusted to reflect Company performance and your individual performance as approved by the Committee.

**Long-Term Incentives**   
Your outstanding equity awards are subject to the provisions in your grant letters as well as any related equity award agreements. 

You will continue to participate in the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) cash performance plan cycles that are underway at the target cash award level contained in your employment or notification letters for those cycles. 

In addition, you will be eligible to participate in the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) cycles in future years on a basis consistent with those of comparable executives in accordance with the provisions of the LTIP and as approved by the Committee. Your LTIP target levels are based upon your position and Officer Band within the Company at the beginning of the three-year performance cycle.

The date the release agreement becomes irrevocable will be the Release Effective Date. If you do not sign a general release agreement within 14 days of the date of your Separation from Service or if you sign such agreement and revoke it within such 14 day period, any amounts and benefits (other than Accrued Obligations and benefits in which you are otherwise vested under the terms of the applicable benefit plans) will cease as of last day of such 14 day period and will not resume unless and until the Release Effective Date.
