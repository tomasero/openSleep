If the [[Organization 3 Name]] is serving as an officer or executive of the Company, the Company will provide [[Organization 3 Name]] or the [[Organization 3 Name]] with written evidence that the Company maintains directors’ and officers’ insurance covering the [[Organization 3 Name]] in an amount reasonably acceptable to the [[Organization 3 Name]] at no additional cost to the [[Organization 3 Name]], and the Company will maintain such insurance at all times while this agreement remains in effect.

Governing Law, Arbitration and Witness Fees. 

^^This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. 

^^If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with this agreement, the parties agree and stipulate that any such disputes will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be conducted in the New York, New York office of the AAA by a single arbitrator selected by the parties according to the rules of the AAA, and the decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on both parties. In the event that the parties fail to agree on the selection of the arbitrator within 30 days after either party’s request for arbitration under this Section, the arbitrator will be chosen by the AAA. The arbitrator may in his or her discretion order documentary discovery but will not allow depositions without a showing of compelling need. The arbitrator will render his or her decision within 90 days after the call for arbitration. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will have no authority to award damages in excess or in contravention of this agreement and may not amend or disregard any provision of this agreement, including this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek appropriate injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, and [[Organization 3 Name]] may pursue payment of any unpaid amounts due under this agreement through any court of competent jurisdiction. 

^^In the event any professional of [[Organization 3 Name]] (including, without limitation, any [[Organization 3 Name]]) is requested or authorized by you or is required by government regulation, subpoena, or other legal process to produce documents or appear as witnesses in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding initiated by a third party against you or by you against a third party, you will, so long as [[Organization 3 Name]] is not a party to the proceeding in which the information is sought, reimburse [[Organization 3 Name]] for its professional’s time (based 

^^^^^ 
on customary rates) and expenses, as well as the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel, incurred in responding to such requests. This provision is in addition to and not in lieu of any indemnification obligations the Company may have under this agreement. 

Miscellaneous.  

^^This agreement together with all Schedules constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to its subject matter. No amendment or modification to this agreement will be valid unless in writing and signed by both parties. 

^^If any portion of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed severable from the remainder of this agreement and will not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this agreement, except to the extent that the severed provision deprives either party of a substantial portion of its bargain. 

^^Neither party will be deemed to have waived any rights or remedies accruing under this agreement unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party electing to waive the right or remedy. The waiver by any party of a breach or violation of any provision of this agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or any other provision of this agreement. 

^^Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform under this agreement (other than with respect to payment obligations) to the extent such delay or failure is a result of an act of God, war, earthquake, civil disobedience, court order, labor dispute, or other cause beyond such party’s reasonable control. 

^^You may not assign your rights or obligations under this agreement without the express written consent of [[Organization 3 Name]], which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. Nothing in this agreement will confer any rights upon any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and the [[Organization 3 Name]]. 

^^The expiration or termination of this agreement or any Schedule will not destroy or diminish the binding force and effect of any of the provisions of this agreement or any Schedule that expressly, or by reasonable implication, come into or continue in effect on or after such expiration or termination, including, without limitation, provisions relating to payment of fees and expenses (including witness fees and expenses and liquidated damage fees), governing law, arbitration, limitation of liability and indemnity. 

^^You agree to reimburse [[Organization 3 Name]] for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and arbitration fees) incurred by [[Organization 3 Name]] in enforcing collection of any monies due under this agreement. 

^^You agree to allow us to use the Company’s logo and name on [[Organization 3 Name]]’s website and other marketing materials for the sole purpose of identifying the Company as a client of [[Organization 3 Name]]. [[Organization 3 Name]] will not use the Company’s logo or name in any press release or general circulation advertisement without the Company’s prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in the Company’s sole discretion. 

We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and believe this agreement accurately reflects our mutual understanding of the terms upon which the Services will be provided. We would be pleased to discuss this agreement with you at your convenience. If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign a copy of this agreement and return it to my attention.

WHEREAS, the Company is entering into an Interim Services Agreement with [[Organization 2 Name]] d/b/a [[Organization 3 Name]] (“[[Organization 3 Name]]”) for the provision to the Company of the services of Wynne described below; 

NOW THEREFORE, Wynne and the Company agree, as follows: 

^Interim Services Agreement: This Agreement is in all respects subject to that Interim Services Agreement dated as of [[Date 4: Date]], including the Schedules attached thereto which is incorporated by reference herein (“Interim Agreement”). Defined terms in the Interim Agreement shall have the same meaning herein, except as otherwise provided. This Agreement shall terminate upon the termination of the Interim Agreement, except for the continuing obligations set out below. 

^Scope of Work; Title: Effective [[Date 1]], Executive shall act as Vice President, Treasurer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, having been elected such by the Board of Directors of the Company (“Board”) on [[Date 4]], subject to the execution and delivery of the Interim Agreement by [[Organization 3 Name]] and the Company. In such capacity, Executive shall on a full-time basis act as the Company’s principal financial and accounting officer and direct all of Executive’s efforts toward the duties assigned Executive by the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Full time” shall mean no outside business activities without the Company’s prior consent. Executive’s place of work shall be the Company’s corporate headquarters at the above address. 

^Compensation and Expenses: Executive’s compensation and reimbursable expenses are entirely provided for by [[Organization 3 Name]] which has furnished Executive’s services to the Company. The Company shall pay the fees and other amounts to [[Organization 3 Name]] as are provided in the Interim Agreement and no other amounts. Executive is not entitled to compensation or expense reimbursement directly from the Company and waives any claim to such compensation or reimbursement. Executive is not entitled to participate in and waives participation in any of the benefit and welfare plans of the Company. Executive shall make provision or shall cause [[Organization 3 Name]] to make provision for his own income and employment taxes as may be applicable and Company shall have no liability for withholding any such taxes 

^Termination of Appointment For Cause. Notwithstanding anything provided for in the Interim Agreement, the Company may at any time terminate this Agreement and the Interim Agreement and all Schedules thereto and the appointment of Executive as Vice President, Treasurer and CFO for Cause. “Cause” shall mean, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, conviction of Executive under, or a plea of guilty by the Executive to, any charge which would constitute a felony under the laws of Connecticut, regardless of jurisdiction; any instance of fraud, embezzlement, self-dealing, insider trading or similar malfeasance with respect to the Company regardless of the amount involved; any instance of material disloyalty, insubordination, or disparagement of the Company to an outside party; or any instance of substance abuse of a controlled substance or, otherwise, a pattern of substance abuse which limits Executive’s performance of Executive’s duties. 

^Discoveries and Inventions: All patentable and unpatentable inventions, discoveries and ideas which are made or conceived or reduced to practice by 

^^^^^ 
Executive during the term of Executive’s employment, and which are based upon or arise out of Executive’s services hereunder (“Developments”) are or shall become the Company’s property. Executive agrees to disclose promptly to the Company each such Development and, upon the Company’s request and at its expense, Executive will assist the Company, or its designee, in making application for Letters Patent, Trade or Service Marks or Copyrights in any country in the world. Executive further agrees, at no expense to Executive, to execute all papers and do all things which may be necessary or advisable to prosecute such applications, and to transfer to and vest in the Company, or its designee, all the right, title and interest in and to such Developments, and all applications for patents and Letters Patent, Trademarks and Service Marks and Copyrights issued thereon. If for any reason Executive is unable to effectuate a full assignment of any such Development, Executive agrees to transfer to the Company, or its designee, Executive’s transferable rights, whether they be exclusive or non-exclusive, or as a joint inventor or partial owner of the Development. No action or inaction by the Company shall in any event be construed as a waiver or abandonment of its rights to any such Development except an instrument in writing assigned by an authorized official of the Company by which it specifically states it intends to be bound in such respect. 

^Proprietary Information: Executive will not at any time, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, disclose to others, or use for Executive’s own benefit or the benefit of others, any of the Developments or any confidential, proprietary or secret information owned, possessed or used by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, “Proprietary Information”), which, by way of illustration, but not limitation, includes devices, structures, machines, data, know-how, business opportunities, marketing plans, forecasts, unpublished financial statements, budgets, licenses and information concerning prices, costs, Executives, customers and suppliers. Executive’s undertakings and obligations under this Paragraph 7 will not apply to any Proprietary Information which: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no action on the part of the Executive or (b) is generally disclosed to third parties by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates without restriction on such third parties. Upon termination of this Agreement or at any other time upon request, Executive will promptly deliver to the Company all keys, notes, memoranda, notebooks, computers, computer disks or drives, drawings, designs, three dimensional figures, photographs, layouts, diagrams, records, reports, files and other documents (and all copies or reproductions of such materials) in Executive’s possession or under Executive’s control, whether prepared by him or others, which contain Proprietary Information. Executive acknowledges that this material is the sole property of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliate of the Company. 

^Continuing Obligations: The Executive’s covenants set forth above in Sections 5 and 6 shall continue according to their terms following the termination of this Agreement. Termination of Executive’s employment for any reason shall constitute termination of this Agreement. 

^Governing Law; Waiver of Trial by Jury; Equitable Remedies. This Agreement, the interpretation hereof and the resolution of any and all disputes directly between the Company and Executive shall be governed by and interpreted under Connecticut law and shall be determined in arbitration as provided by the Interim Agreement but in Bridgeport Connecticut. In the event of any judicial proceeding in any jurisdiction the parties waive trial by jury. The parties further agree that any violations of Executive’s covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6 above may cause irreparable harm to the Company which harm is not capable of accurate determination and for which the remedy of damages may be insufficient. Accordingly, in any proceeding to enforce the Company’s rights under such Sections 5 and 6 the Company may seek, in addition to 

^^^^^ 
damages, equitable remedies such as injunctions, temporary injunctions and restraining orders and the parties hereby waive any requirement of bond in any such proceeding or in any appeal therefrom.

All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon receipt, if hand delivered, or if sent by facsimile and acknowledged electronically, or by courier and receipted on delivery. Notices by mail shall be deemed received on receipt, if sent first class or priority mail postage prepaid return receipt requested and the sender shall have the signed receipt.
