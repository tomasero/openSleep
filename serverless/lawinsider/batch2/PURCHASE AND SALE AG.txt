Any tenant improvement allowances shall be at market rates, not to exceed $15.00 for 2nd generation space and $30.00 per square foot for 1st generation space (over vanilla shell). If all concessions and allowances have not been fully satisfied prior to the earnout payment for that tenant, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, allow such unsatisfied amounts to be a credit to Buyer against the earnout price. 

^**Form Lease:** All leases shall be prepared substantially in accordance with the small shop tenant lease form approved by Buyer subject to commercially reasonable variances and prevailing market parameters, except that a lease for a national tenant of 10,000 square feet or more (a “Junior Anchor”) may be prepared using the tenant’s lease form.

^**Rent Increases:** All proposed leases shall average at least [[Percentage 2: Number]]% increases per year over the primary term of the lease. The only permitted exception is National Credit Tenants which must average no less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]% increases every 5 years minimum. 

^**Pass-Throughs:** In addition to tenant’s base rent, the proposed leases will include [[Percentage 4: Number]]% reimbursement for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, including either a [[Percentage 3]]% (of CAM) administrative charge or a 4-1/[[Percentage 5: Number]]% management fee.

\centered Exhibit 11.11B  Page 2

**Leasing Parameters specify sole discretion for a parameter, in which case the more stringent requirement shall apply). Seller should present to Buyer all lease proposals, letters of intent, etc. as early as possible, to ensure that the Leasing Parameters are satisfied by each prospective tenant.**
