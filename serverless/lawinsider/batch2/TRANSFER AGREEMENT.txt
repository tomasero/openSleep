For the purposes of this Agreement, Registrable Securities held by any Designated Shareholder will cease to be Registrable Securities when (i) a Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities has been declared effective under the Securities Act by the Commission and such Registrable Securities have been disposed of pursuant to such effective Registration Statement, (ii) the entire amount of the Registrable Securities held by any Designated Shareholder may be sold in a single sale, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, without any limitation as to volume or manner of sale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or (iii) they have ceased to be outstanding.

^^**Holders of Registrable Securities**. A Person is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns of record Registrable Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable Securities, the Company may act upon the basis of the instructions, notice or election received from the registered owner of such Registrable Securities. Registrable Securities consisting of Warrant Shares shall be deemed outstanding for the purposes of this Agreement.

^^**Transfer of Registration Rights****.**  
^^^Each Designated Shareholder may transfer or pledge Registrable Securities with the associated registration rights under this Agreement (including transfers occurring by operation of law or by reason of intestacy) to a Permitted Assignee or a pledgee (“**Pledgee**”) only if (1) such Permitted Assignee or Pledgee agrees in writing to be bound as a Designated Shareholder by the provisions of this Agreement, such agreement being substantially in the form of **Annex A** hereto, and (2) immediately following such transfer or pledge, the further disposition of such Registrable Securities by such Permitted Assignee or Pledgee would be restricted under the Securities Act and the entire amount of all such Registrable Securities could not be sold in a single sale, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, without any limitation as to volume or manner of sale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. Upon any transfer or pledge of Registrable Securities other than as set forth in this Section 2(d), such securities shall no longer constitute Registrable Securities.

^^^Subject to Section 2(b), if a Designated Shareholder assigns its rights under this Agreement in connection with the transfer of less than all of its Registrable Securities, the Designated Shareholder shall retain its rights under this Agreement with respect to its remaining Registrable Securities. If a Designated Shareholder assigns its rights under this Agreement in connection with the transfer of all of its Registrable Securities, such Designated Shareholder shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement, except under Section 5 in respect of offerings in which it participated.

^**S-3 Registration**

^^As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. Such Registration Statement filed hereunder shall be on Form S-3 or, if such form is not available to the Company, Form S-1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event within sixty (60) days of the date hereof (**provided, however**, that in the event the Company is notified by the Commission that the Registration Statement will not be reviewed or is no longer subject to further review and comments, within five (5) business days following the date on which the Company is so notified).

^^If for any reason the Commission does not permit all of the Registrable Securities to be included in the Registration Statement(s) filed pursuant to Section 3(a), or for any other reason any outstanding Registrable Securities are not then covered by an effective Registration Statement(s), then the Company shall prepare and file, as promptly as possible and in all instances within 30 days of the Commission’s notification not to permit registration of all the Registrable Securities, an additional Registration Statement covering the resale of all Registrable Securities not already covered by an existing and effective Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pur suant to Rule 415, on Form S-3 (or on such other form appropriate for such purpose).

^**Registration Procedures**

^^**Obligations of the Company**. Whenever registration of Registrable Securities has been required pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities as quickly as practicable, and in connection with any such request, the Company shall:

^^^prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on any form for which the Company then qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution, and cause such Registration Statement to become effective; **provided, however**, that (x) before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (including, without limitatio n, any documents incorporated by reference therein), or before using any Free Writing Prospectus, the Company shall provide one firm of legal counsel selected by the Designated Shareholders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities being registered in such registration (“**Designated Shareholders’ Counsel**”), any managing underwriter or broker/dealer participating in any disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and any attorney retained by any such managing underwriter or broker/dealer (each, an “**Inspector**” and collectively, the “**Inspectors**”) with an opportunity to review and comment on such Registration Statement and each Prospectus included therein (and each amendment or supplement thereto) and each Free Writing Prospectus to be fi led with the Commission, subject to such documents being under the Company’s control, and (y) the Company shall notify the Designated Shareholders’ Counsel and each seller of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement of any stop order issued or threatened by the Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered;

^^^use its commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other securities or “blue sky” laws of California and New York if required by the laws of such states, and continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction for as long as permissible pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller requests or until all of such Registrable Securities are sold or are “covered securities” under the Securities Act, whichever is shortest, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable any such seller to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller in such jurisdictions; **provided, however**, that the Company shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 4(a)(iv), (y) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

^^^following its actual knowledge thereof, notify each seller of Registrable Securities: (A) when a Prospectus, any Prospectus supplement, any Free Writing Prospectus, a Registration Statement or a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or for additional information; (C) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such purpose; and (D) of the existence of any fact or happening of any event of which the Company has knowledge which makes any statement of a material fact in such Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue or which would require the making of any changes in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus in order that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any m aterial fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided that the Company need not disclose any facts or events that have not bee publicly disclosed by the Company;

^^^upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 4(a)(v)(D), as promptly as practicable, prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus and furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities a reasonable number of copies of such supplement to, or amendment of, such Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus as may be necessary so that, after delivery to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

^^^enter into and perform customary agreements and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities and shall provide all reasonable cooperation, including causing counsel to the Company to deliver customary legal opinions in connection with any such underwriting agreements;

^^^make available at reasonable times for inspection by any Inspector all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “**Records**”) as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, managers and employees, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector in connection with such Registratio n Statement. Records that the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors (and the Inspectors shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the Company if the Company shall so request) unless (x) the disclosure of such Records is necessary, in the Company’s reasonable judgment, to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement, (y) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the information in such Records was known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Company or has been made generally available to the public. Each seller of Registrable Securities agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, promptly give notice t o the Company and allow the Company, at the Company’s expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential;

^^^if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten offering, obtain a “cold comfort” letter dated the effective date of the Registration Statement and the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by “cold comfort” letters as the managing underwriter reasonably requests;

^^^furnish, at the request of any seller of Registrable Securities on the date such securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration, an opinion, dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters, covering such legal matters with respect to the registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the underwriters, may reasonably request and are customarily included in such opinions; cause any Shares included in the Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which the Shares are then listed, **provided** that the applicable listing requirements are satisfied;

^^^make all required filings of all Prospectuses and Free Writing Prospectuses with the Commission;

^^^make all required filing fee payments in respect of any Registration Statement or Prospectus used under this Agreement (and any offering covered thereby); and

^^^take all other steps reasonably necessary to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby

^^**Seller Requirements**. In connection with any offering under any Registration Statement under this Agreement, each Designated Shareholder (i) shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing such information with respect to such Designated Shareholder and the intended method of disposition of its Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request or as may be required by law or regulations for use in connection with any related Registration Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) and all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Designated Shareholder not contain a material misstatement of fact or necessary to cause such Registration Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) not to omit a material fact with respect to such Designated Shareholder necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) shall comply with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and all applicable state securities laws and comply with all applicable regulations in connection with the registration and the disposition of the Registrable Securities; and (iii) shall not use any Free Writing Prospectus without the prior written consent of the Company.

^^**Notice to Discontinue**. Each Designated Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 4(a)(v)(D), such Designated Shareholder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until such Designated Shareholder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(a)(vi) (or if no supplemental or amended prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is required, upon confirmation from the Company that use of the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is once again permitted) and, if so directed by the Company, such Designated Shareholder shall deliver to the Company (at the Company’s expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Designated Shareholder’s possession, of the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities which is current at the time of receipt of such notice.

The Company shall pay all expenses arising from or incident to its performance of, or compliance with, this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) Commission, filing fees, (ii) all fees and expenses incurred in complying with state securities or “blue sky” laws (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to any underwriter incurred in connection with “blue sky” qualifications of the Registrable Securities as may be set forth in any underwriting agreement), (iii) all printing, messenger and delivery expenses, and (iv) the fees, charges and expense s of counsel to the Company and of its independent registered public accounting firm and any other accounting fees, charges and expenses incurred by the Company (including, without limitation, any expenses arising from any “cold comfort” letters and the reasonable and documented legal fees, charges and expenses of Designated Shareholder’s Counsel and regardless of whether such Registration Statement is declared effective. All of the expenses described in the preceding sentence of this Section 4(d) are referred to herein as “Registration Expenses”.

^**Indemnification; Contribution**

^^**Indemnification by the Company**. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Designated Shareholder, its partners, directors, officers, Affiliates, stockholders, members, employees, trustees, legal counsel and accountants and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) such Designated Shareholder from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, or any action or proceeding in respect thereof (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (each, a “Liability” and collectively, “ Liabilities”), arising out of or based upon (a) any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto; (b) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading under the circumstances such statements were made and (c) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder, in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be held liable in any such case to the extent that any such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto solely in reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning a Designated Shareholder furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Designated Shareholder expressly for use therein, including, without limitation, the information furnished to the Company pursuant to Sections 4(b) and 5(b). The Company shall also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the Registrable Securities, their officers, directors and employees and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Designated Shareholders.

^^**Indemnification by Designated Shareholders**. In connection with any offering in which a Designated Shareholder is participating pursuant to Section 3, such Designated Shareholder agrees severally to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the other Designated Shareholders, any underwriter retained by the Company and each Person who controls the Company, the other Designated Shareholders or such underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Designated Shareholders (including indemnification of their respective partners, directors , officers, Affiliates, stockholders, managers, members, employees, trustees and Controlling Persons), but only to the extent that Liabilities arise out of or are based upon a statement or alleged statement or an omission or alleged omission that was made solely in reliance upon and in conformity with information with respect to such Designated Shareholder furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Designated Shareholder expressly for use in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto, including, without limitation, the information furnished to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b). In no event shall the liability of any selling Designated Shareholder hereunder be greater in amount than the net proceeds received by such Designated Shareholder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation except in the case of fraud by such Desig nated Shareholder.

^^**Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings**. Any Person entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder (the “Indemnified Party”) agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the “Indemnifying Party”) after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat made in writing for which the Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as provided in this Section 5(c), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of suc h action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. In any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties and all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified Party is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

^^**Contribution**. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of any Liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in such Liabilities, as well as an y other relevant equitable considerations. The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c) , any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.

^^^The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d)) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In no event shall any Designated Shareholder be required to contribute an amount under this Section 5(d ) in excess of the net proceeds received by such Designated Shareholder upon the sale of such Designated Shareholder’s Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement giving rise to such contribution obligation, except in the case of fraud by such Designated Shareholder.

^**Reports Under Exchange Act**

With a view to making available to the Designated Shareholders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit a Designated Shareholder to sell Registrable Shares of the Company to the public without registration, the Company agrees to:

^^File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchanges;

^^Undertake any additional actions reasonably necessary to maintain the availability of the use of Rule 144, the Company’s eligibility to file and maintain continuously effective Form S-3 registration statements and any future rules adopted by the Commission permitting the resale of the Registrable Securities.
