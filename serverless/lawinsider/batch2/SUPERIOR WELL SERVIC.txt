\centered **[[Organization 1 Name]], INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN** 

\centered I. PURPOSE AND HISTORY 

The purpose of this [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc. Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan is to provide a means through which **[[Organization 1 Name]], INC.,** a Delaware corporation (the **“*Company*”**), and its Affiliates may attract able persons to serve as Directors or Consultants or to enter the employ of the Company and its Affiliates and to provide a means whereby those individuals upon whom the responsibilities of the successful administration and management of the Company and its Affiliates rest, and whose present and potential contributions to the Company and its Affiliates are of importance, can acquire and maintain stock ownership, thereby strengthening their concern for the welfare of the Company and its Affiliates. A further purpose of this plan is to provide such individuals with additional incentive and reward opportunities designed to enhance the profitable growth of the Company and its Affiliates. Accordingly, this plan provides for granting Incentive Stock Options, options that do not constitute Incentive Stock Options, Restricted Stock Awards, Performance Awards, Annual Incentive Awards, Phantom Stock Awards, Bonus Stock Awards, or any combination of the foregoing, as is best suited to the circumstances of the particular employee, Consultant, or Director as provided herein. 

This plan was initially approved by the Company’s stockholders on [[Date 1: Date]] in connection with it’s initial public offering as the “[[Organization 1 Name]], Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.” This plan is now being amended and restated to: (a) include the requisite provisions for compliance with section 162(m) of the Code, (b) include an additional award element to the plan in the form of annual cash bonuses, and (c) re-title the plan as the [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc. Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (the **“*Plan*”**). The amendment and restatement of this Plan is not, however, intended to affect the terms of any Award granted prior to the effective date of this Plan without the prior written consent of the affected Participant(s).

^^*“Annual Incentive Award”* means a conditional right granted to a Participant under Paragraph IX of the Plan hereof to receive a cash payment, Common Stock or other Award, as determined by the Committee, after the end of a specified year; Annual Incentive Awards may be designed as “performance-based compensation” for purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, at the Committee’s discretion.

The Plan was originally effective as of [[Date 1]]. This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall become effective upon the date of its adoption by the Board. No further Awards may be granted under the Plan after 10 years from the date of the Plan’s original effective date, meaning that no further Awards will be granted pursuant to the Plan following [[Date 2: Date]].

\centered IV. ADMINISTRATION 

^^*Composition of Committee.* The Plan shall be administered by a committee of, and appointed by, the Board. In the absence of the Board’s appointment of a Committee to administer the Plan, the Board shall serve as the Committee, in which case references herein to the “Committee” shall be deemed to include references to the “Board.” At any time that a member of a Committee is not a Qualified Member, any action of the applicable Committee relating to an Award granted or to be granted to a Participant who is then an Executive Officer, or relating to an Award intended by the Committee to qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder, may be taken either (i) by a subcommittee, designated by the Committee, composed solely of two or more Qualified Members, or (ii) by the Committee but with each such member who is not a Qualified Member abstaining or recusing himself or herself from such action; provided, however, that, upon such abstention or recusal, the Committee remains composed solely of two or more Qualified Members. Such action, authorized by such a subcommittee or by the Committee upon the abstention or recusal of such non-Qualified Member(s), shall be the action of the Committee for purposes of this Plan. Any action of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its Affiliates, stockholders, Participants, beneficiaries, and permitted transferees under the Plan or other persons claiming rights from or through a Participant. The express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the Committee. The 

^^^^^ 
Committee may delegate to officers or managers of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or committees thereof, the authority, subject to such terms as the Committee shall determine, to perform such functions, including administrative functions, as the Committee may determine, to the extent that such delegation will not result in the loss of an exemption under Rule 16b-3(d)(1) for Awards granted to Executive Officers and will not cause Awards intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under section 162(m) of the Code to fail to so qualify. The Committee may appoint agents to assist it in administering the Plan. 

^^*Powers.* Subject to the express provisions of the Plan and Rule 16b-3, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (i) adopt, amend, and rescind administrative and interpretive rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (ii) determine the eligible persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted; (iii) determine the amount of cash and the number of shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, that shall be the subject of each Award; (iv) determine the terms and provisions of each Award agreement (which need not be identical), including provisions defining or otherwise relating to (A) the term and the period or periods and extent of exercisability of the Options, (B) the extent to which the transferability of shares of Common Stock issued or transferred pursuant to any Award is restricted, (C) except as otherwise provided herein, the effect of termination of employment, or the service relationship with the Company, of a Participant on the Award, and (D) the effect of approved leaves of absence (consistent with any applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service); (v) accelerate the time of exercisability of any Award that has been granted; (vi) construe the respective Award agreements and the Plan; (vii) make determinations of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock pursuant to the Plan; (viii) delegate its duties under the Plan to such agents as it may appoint from time to time, provided that the Committee may not delegate its duties with respect to making Awards to individuals subject to section 162(m) of the Code, or otherwise with respect to Awards granted to Executive Officers; (ix) subject to the restrictions contained within the Plan, terminate, modify or amend the Plan, and (x) make all other determinations, perform all other acts, and exercise all other powers and authority necessary or advisable for administering the Plan, including the delegation of those ministerial acts and responsibilities as the Committee deems appropriate. In making such determinations, the Committee shall take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective employees, Consultants, or Directors, their present and potential contribution to the Company’s success, and such other factors as the Committee in its sole discretion shall deem relevant. 

^^*Additional Powers.* The Committee shall have such additional powers as are delegated to it by the other provisions of the Plan. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, this shall include the power to construe the Plan and the respective agreements executed hereunder, to prescribe rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to determine the terms, restrictions and provisions of the agreement relating to each Award, including such terms, restrictions and provisions as shall be requisite in the judgment of the Committee to cause designated Options to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. Subject to Rule 16b-3 and section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, in any Award, or in any Award agreement in the manner and to the extent it deems necessary or desirable to carry the Plan into effect, and the Committee shall be the sole and final judge of that necessity or desirability. The determinations of the Committee on the matters referred to in this Paragraph IV shall be conclusive. 

\centered V. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; AWARD LIMITS; GRANT OF AWARDS 

^^*Shares Subject to the Plan and Award Limits.* Subject to adjustment in the same manner as provided in Paragraph XII with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to Options then outstanding, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan, and the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan through Incentive Stock Options, shall not exceed [[Shares 1: Number]] shares. Shares shall be deemed to have been issued under the Plan only to the extent actually issued and delivered pursuant to an Award. To the extent that an Award lapses or the rights of its holder terminate, any shares of Common Stock subject to such Award shall again be available for the grant of an Award under the Plan. In addition, shares issued under the Plan and forfeited back to the Plan, shares surrendered in payment of the exercise price or purchase price of an Award, and shares withheld for payment of applicable employment taxes and/or withholding obligations associated with an Award shall again be available for the grant of an Award under the Plan. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that 

^^^^^ 
may be subject to Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock granted to any one individual during the term of the Plan may not exceed [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of Common Stock, and the maximum amount of compensation that may be paid under all Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards denominated in cash (including the Fair Market Value of any shares of Common Stock paid in satisfaction of such Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards) granted to any one individual during any calendar year may not exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]] million. 

^^*Grant of Awards.* The Committee may from time to time grant Awards to one or more employees, Consultants, or Directors determined by it to be eligible for participation in the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Plan. 

^^*Stock Offered.* Subject to the limitations set forth in Paragraph V(a), the stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an Award may be authorized but unissued Common Stock or Common Stock previously issued and outstanding and reacquired by the Company. Any of such shares which remain unissued and which are not subject to outstanding Awards at the termination of the Plan shall cease to be subject to the Plan but, until termination of the Plan, the Company shall at all times make available a sufficient number of shares to meet the requirements of the Plan. 

\centered VI. ELIGIBILITY 

Awards may be granted only to persons who, at the time of grant, are employees, Consultants, or Directors. An Award may be granted on more than one occasion to the same person, and, subject to the limitations set forth in the Plan, such Award may include an Incentive Stock Option, an Option that is not an Incentive Stock Option, a Restricted Stock Award, a Performance Award, an Annual Incentive Award, a Phantom Stock Award, a Bonus Stock Award, or any combination thereof. 

\centered VII. STOCK OPTIONS 

^^*Option Period.* The term of each Option shall be as specified by the Committee at the date of grant, but in no event shall an Option be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant. 

^^*Limitations on Exercise of Option.* An Option shall be exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such times as determined by the Committee. 

^^*Special Limitations on Incentive Stock Options.* An Incentive Stock Option may be granted only to an individual who is employed by the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation (as defined in section 424 of the Code) at the time the Option is granted. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the respective Incentive Stock Option is granted) of stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an individual during any calendar year under all incentive stock option plans of the Company and its parent and subsidiary corporations exceeds $[[USD Value 1: Number]] such Incentive Stock Options shall be treated as Options which do not constitute Incentive Stock Options. The Committee shall determine, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations and other administrative pronouncements, which of a Participant’s Incentive Stock Options will not constitute Incentive Stock Options because of such limitation and shall notify the Participant of such determination as soon as practicable after such determination. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to an individual if, at the time the Option is granted, such individual owns stock possessing more than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of its parent or subsidiary corporation, within the meaning of section 422(b)(6) of the Code, unless (i) at the time such Option is granted the option price is at least [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option and (ii) such Option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of grant. An Incentive Stock Option shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative. 

^^*Option Agreement.* Each Option shall be evidenced by an Option Agreement in such form and containing such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee from time to time 

^^^^^ 
shall approve, including, without limitation, provisions to qualify an Incentive Stock Option under section 422 of the Code. Each Option Agreement shall specify the effect of termination of (i) employment, (ii) the consulting or advisory relationship, or (iii) membership on the Board, as applicable, on the exercisability of the Option. An Option Agreement may provide for the payment of the option price, in whole or in part, by the delivery of a number of shares of Common Stock (plus cash if necessary) having a Fair Market Value equal to such option price. Moreover, an Option Agreement may provide for a “cashless exercise” of the Option by establishing procedures satisfactory to the Committee with respect thereto. Further, an Option Agreement may provide, on such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may prescribe, for the grant of a Stock Appreciation Right in connection with the grant of an Option and, in such case, the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right shall result in the surrender of the right to purchase a number of shares under the Option equal to the number of shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised (and vice versa). In the case of any Stock Appreciation Right that is granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option, such right shall be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock exceeds the price specified therefor in the Option or the portion thereof to be surrendered. The terms and conditions of the respective Option Agreements need not be identical. Subject to the consent of the Participant, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend an outstanding Option Agreement from time to time in any manner that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, an amendment that accelerates the time at which the Option, or a portion thereof, may be exercisable). 

^^*Option Price and Payment.* The price at which a share of Common Stock may be purchased upon exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Committee but, subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph XII such purchase price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date such Option is granted. The Option or portion thereof may be exercised by delivery of an irrevocable notice of exercise to the Company, as specified by the Committee. The purchase price of the Option or portion thereof shall be paid in full in the manner prescribed by the Committee. Separate stock certificates shall be issued by the Company for those shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and for those shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of any Option that does not constitute an Incentive Stock Option. 

^^*Restrictions on Repricing of Options.* Except as provided in Paragraph XII, the Committee may not, without approval of the stockholders of the Company, amend any outstanding Option Agreement to lower the option price (or cancel and replace any outstanding Option Agreement with Option Agreements having a lower option price). 

^^*Stockholder Rights and Privileges.* The Participant shall be entitled to all the privileges and rights of a stockholder only with respect to such shares of Common Stock as have been purchased under the Option and for which certificates of stock have been registered in the Participant’s name. 

^^*Options and Rights in Substitution for Options Granted by Other Employers.* Options and Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted under the Plan from time to time in substitution for options and such rights held by individuals providing services to corporations or other entities who become employees, Consultants, or Directors as a result of a merger or consolidation or other business transaction with the Company or any Affiliate. 

\centered VIII. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS 

^^*Forfeiture Restrictions To Be Established by the Committee.* Shares of Common Stock that are the subject of a Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to restrictions on disposition by the Participant and an obligation of the Participant to forfeit and surrender the shares to the Company under certain circumstances (the **“*Forfeiture Restrictions*”**). The Forfeiture Restrictions shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and the Committee may provide that the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse upon the attainment of one or more performance measures established by the Committee. In the event that the Committee determines to subject the Restricted Stock to performance measures in order to create a “performance-based compensation” award as defined in section 162(m) of the Code, the performance conditions will be composed of and comply with the provisions of Paragraph IX of this Plan. Where the Restricted Stock is not intended to be “performance-based compensation” under section 162(m) of the Code, any performance measures may be determined by the Committee in its sole 

^^^^^ 
discretion. Each Restricted Stock Award may have different Forfeiture Restrictions, in the discretion of the Committee. 

^^*Other Terms and Conditions.* Common Stock awarded pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award shall be represented by a stock certificate registered in the name of the Participant. Unless provided otherwise in a Restricted Stock Agreement, the Participant shall have the right to receive dividends with respect to Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award, to vote Common Stock subject thereto and to enjoy all other stockholder rights, except that (i) the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate until the Forfeiture Restrictions have expired, (ii) the Company shall retain custody of the stock until the Forfeiture Restrictions have expired, (iii) the Participant may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the stock until the Forfeiture Restrictions have expired, and (iv) a breach of the terms and conditions established by the Committee pursuant to the Restricted Stock Agreement shall cause a forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Award. At the time of such Award, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms, conditions or restrictions relating to Restricted Stock Awards, including, but not limited to, rules pertaining to the termination of employment or service as a Consultant or Director (by retirement, disability, death or otherwise, such terms of which shall be defined in the applicable Award agreement) of a Participant prior to expiration of the Forfeitures Restrictions. Such additional terms, conditions or restrictions shall be set forth in a Restricted Stock Agreement made in conjunction with the Award. 

^^*Payment for Restricted Stock.* The Committee shall determine the amount and form of any payment for Common Stock received pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award, provided that in the absence of such a determination, a Participant shall not be required to make any payment for Common Stock received pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award, except to the extent otherwise required by law. 

^^*Committee’s Discretion to Accelerate Vesting of Restricted Stock Awards.* The Committee may, in its discretion and as of a date determined by the Committee, fully vest any or all Common Stock awarded to a Participant pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award and, upon such vesting, all restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock Award shall terminate as of such date. Any action by the Committee pursuant to this Subparagraph may vary among individual Participants and may vary among the Restricted Stock Awards held by any individual Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Subparagraph, the Committee may not take any action described in this Subparagraph with respect to a Restricted Stock Award that has been granted to a Covered Employee if such Award has been designed to meet the exception for performance-based compensation under section 162(m) of the Code. 

^^*Restricted Stock Agreements.* At the time any Award is made under this Paragraph VIII, the Company and the Participant shall enter into a Restricted Stock Agreement setting forth each of the matters contemplated hereby and such other matters as the Committee may determine to be appropriate. The terms and provisions of the respective Restricted Stock Agreements need not be identical. Subject to the consent of the Participant and the restriction set forth in the last sentence of Subparagraph (d) above, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend an outstanding Restricted Stock Agreement from time to time in any manner that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. 

\centered IX. PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS 

^^*Performance Conditions.* The right of a Participant to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions, and may exercise its discretion to reduce or increase the amounts payable under any Award subject to performance conditions, except as limited under Paragraphs IX(b) and IX(c) hereof in the case of a Performance Award or Annual Incentive Award intended to qualify under section 162(m) of the Code. 

^^*Performance Awards.* If the Committee determines that a Performance Award to be granted to an eligible person who is designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee should qualify as “performance-based compensation” for purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such 

^^^^^ 
Performance Award will be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Paragraph IX(b). The Committee may not exercise discretion to increase the amounts payable under any Performance Award subject to performance conditions for Awards intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” to a Covered Employee. For all Performance Awards granted to an eligible person who is not designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee, the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such a Performance Award may also be contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Paragraph IX(b) or on any such other performance goals and terms determined appropriate by the Committee for the applicable performance period or eligible person. 

^^^*Performance Goals Generally.* The performance goals for Performance Awards shall consist of one or more business criteria or individual performance criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the Committee consistent with this Paragraph IX(b). Performance goals shall be objective and shall otherwise meet the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder (including Treasury Regulation § 1.162-27 and successor regulations thereto), including the requirement that the level or levels of performance targeted by the Committee result in the achievement of performance goals being “substantially uncertain” at the time the Committee actually establishes the performance goal or goals for grants to all eligible persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered Employees. The Committee may determine that such Performance Awards shall be granted, exercised, and/or settled upon achievement of any one performance goal or that two or more of the performance goals must be achieved as a condition to grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Performance Awards. Performance goals may differ for Performance Awards granted to any one Participant or to different Participants. 

^^^*Business and Individual Performance Criteria.* 

^*Business Criteria*. One or more of the following business criteria for the Company, on a consolidated basis, and/or for specified subsidiaries or business or geographical units of the Company, shall be used by the Committee in establishing performance goals for such Performance Awards: (1) earnings per share; (2) increase in revenues; (3) increase in cash flow; (4) return on invested capital; (5) return on equity; (6) change in the fair market value of our stock; (7) debt reduction; (8) operating margin; (9) net income; (10) pretax earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization; (11) pretax earnings; (12) any of the above goals determined on an absolute or relative basis or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the Committee including, but not limited to, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index or a group of comparable companies. The business criteria shall be subject to adjustment for changes in accounting standards required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board after the goal is established, and, to the extent provided for in any Award agreement, shall be subject to adjustment for specified significant extraordinary items or events, or nonrecurring transactions or events. In this regard, business criteria based on the price of our Common Stock shall be proportionately adjusted for any changes in the price due to a stock split, recapitalization or similar corporate transaction. One or more of the foregoing business criteria shall also be exclusively used in establishing performance goals for Annual Incentive Awards granted to a Covered Employee under Paragraph IX(c) hereof. 

^*Individual Criteria*. The grant, exercise and/or settlement of Performance Awards may also be contingent upon individual performance goals established by the Committee. If required for compliance with section 162(m) of the Code, such criteria shall be approved by the Company’s stockholders. 

^^^*Performance Period; Timing for Establishing Performance Awards.* Achievement of performance goals in respect of Performance Awards shall be measured over a performance period of up to ten years, as specified by the Committee. Performance goals shall be established no later than the earliest of the following to occur: (A) 90 days after the beginning of any performance period applicable to such Performance Awards, (B) the last date that would constitute less than [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the performance period applicable to such Performance Awards, or (C) at such other date as may be required or permitted for “performance-based compensation” under section 162(m) of the Code. 

^^^^^ 
^^^*Performance Award Pool.* The Committee may, at its discretion, establish a Performance Award pool(s), which shall be an unfunded pool, for purposes of measuring performance of the Company in connection with Performance Awards associated with any given performance period. The amount of such Performance Award pool shall be based upon the achievement of a performance goal or goals based on one or more of the criteria set forth in Paragraph IX(b)(2) hereof for eligible persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee, or based upon performance goal(s) as determined by the Committee for all other eligible persons, during the given performance period as specified by the Committee in accordance with Paragraph IX(b)(3) hereof. The Committee may specify the amount of the Performance Award pool(s) as a percentage of any of such criteria, a percentage thereof in excess of a threshold amount, or as another amount which need not bear a strictly mathematical relationship to such criteria. 

^^*Payment of Performance Awards.* After the end of each designated performance period, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, of (A) the applicable Performance Award pool, and the maximum amount of the potential Performance Award payable to each Participant in the Performance Award pool, or (B) the amount of the potential Performance Award otherwise payable to each Participant. Settlement of such Performance Awards shall be in cash, Common Stock, other Awards or other property, in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with such Performance Awards, but may not exercise discretion to increase any such amount payable to a Covered Employee in respect of a Performance Award subject to this Paragraph IX(b). The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which such Performance Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of employment by the Participant prior to the end of a performance period or settlement of Performance Awards. 

^^*Annual Incentive Awards*. If the Committee determines that an Annual Incentive Award to be granted to an eligible person who is designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee should qualify as “performance-based compensation” for purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Annual Incentive Award shall be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Paragraph IX(c). The Committee may not exercise discretion to increase the amounts payable under any Annual Incentive Award subject to performance conditions for Awards intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” to a Covered Employee. For all Annual Incentive Awards granted to an eligible person who is not designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee, the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such an Annual Incentive Award may also be contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Paragraph IX(c) or on any such other performance goals and terms determined appropriate by the Committee for the applicable performance period or eligible person. 

^^^*Potential Annual Incentive Awards.* Not later than the end of the 90th day of each applicable year, or at such other date as may be required or permitted in the case of Awards intended to be “performance-based compensation” under section 162(m) of the Code such as the last date that would constitute less than [[Percentage 4]]% of the applicable performance period year, the Committee shall determine the eligible persons who will potentially receive Annual Incentive Awards, and the amounts potentially payable thereunder, for that fiscal year, either out of an Annual Incentive Award pool established by such date under Paragraph IX (c)(i) hereof or as individual Annual Incentive Awards. The amount potentially payable, with respect to Annual Incentive Awards, shall be based upon the achievement of a performance goal or goals based on one or more of the business criteria set forth in Paragraph IX(b)(ii) hereof for eligible persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee, or based upon performance goal(s) as determined by the Committee for all other eligible persons, in the given performance year, as specified by the Committee. 

^^^*Annual Incentive Award Pool.* The Committee may, at its discretion, establish an Annual Incentive Award pool(s), which shall be an unfunded pool, for purposes of measuring performance of the Company in connection with Annual Incentive Awards for any given performance year. The amount of any Annual Incentive Award pool shall be based upon the achievement of a performance goal or goals based on one or more of the business criteria set forth in Paragraph IX(b)(ii) hereof for eligible persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered Employee, or based upon performance goal(s) as determined by the Committee for all other eligible persons, during the given performance period, as specified by the Committee 

^^^^^ 
in accordance with Paragraph IX(b)(iii) hereof. The Committee may specify the amount of the Annual Incentive Award pool as a percentage of any of such business criteria, a percentage thereof in excess of a threshold amount, or as another amount which need not bear a strictly mathematical relationship to such business criteria. 

^^^*Payment of Annual Incentive Awards.* After the end of each applicable year, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, of (A) the applicable Annual Incentive Award pool, and the maximum amount of the potential Annual Incentive Award payable to each Participant in the Annual Incentive Award pool, or (B) the amount of the potential Annual Incentive Award otherwise payable to each Participant. The Committee may, in its discretion, determine that the amount payable to any Participant as a final Annual Incentive Award shall be reduced from the amount of his or her potential Annual Incentive Award, including a determination to make no final Award whatsoever, but may not exercise discretion to increase any such amount in the case of an Annual Incentive Award intended to qualify under section 162(m) of the Code. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which an Annual Incentive Award shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of employment by the Participant prior to the end of the applicable year or settlement of such Annual Incentive Award. 

^^*Awards Criteria*. In determining the value of the settlement or payment of Performance Awards and Annual Incentive Awards, the Committee shall take into account a Participant’s responsibility level, performance, potential, other Awards, and such other considerations as it deems appropriate. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide for a reduction in the value of a Participant’s Performance Award or Annual Incentive Award during the applicable performance period. 

^^*Termination of Award*. A Performance Award or an Annual Incentive Award shall terminate if the Participant does not remain continuously in the employ of the Company and its Affiliates or does not continue to perform services as a Consultant or a Director for the Company and its Affiliates at all times during the applicable performance period, except as may be determined by the Committee subject to the restrictions of section 162(m) of the Code. 

^^*Performance Award and Annual Incentive Award Agreements*. At the time any Award is made under this Paragraph IX, the Company and the Participant shall enter into an Award Agreement setting forth each of the matters contemplated hereby, and such additional matters as the Committee may determine to be appropriate. The terms and provisions of the respective Performance Award Agreements, or the respective Annual Incentive Award Agreements, need not be identical. 

^^*Written Determinations*. All determinations by the Committee as to the establishment of performance goals, the amount of any Performance Award pool or potential individual Performance Awards, the achievement of performance goals relating to and final settlement of Performance Awards under Paragraph IX(b), the amount of any Annual Incentive Award pool or potential individual Annual Incentive Awards, the achievement of performance goals relating to and final settlement of Annual Incentive Awards under Paragraph IX(c) shall be made in writing in the case of any Award intended to qualify under section 162(m) of the Code. Notwithstanding the allowance in Paragraph IV of this Plan regarding delegation of duties or administration, the applicable Committee may not delegate any responsibilities described in this Paragraph IX(g) relating to such Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards. 

^^*Status of Paragraph IX(b) and Paragraph IX(c) Awards under Section 162(m) of the Code*. It is the intent of the Company that Performance Awards and Annual Incentive Awards under Paragraph IX(b) and Paragraph IX(c) hereof granted to persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered Employees shall, if so designated by the Committee, constitute “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the terms of Paragraph IX, as well as the definitions of Covered Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder for all eligible persons designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered Employees. If any provision of this Plan as in effect on the date of adoption of any agreements relating to Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards that are designated as intended to comply with section 162(m) of the Code does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code 

^^^^^ 
or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. 

\centered X. PHANTOM STOCK AWARDS 

^^*Phantom Stock Awards*. Phantom Stock Awards are rights to receive shares of Common Stock (or the Fair Market Value thereof), or rights to receive an amount equal to any appreciation or increase in the Fair Market Value of Common Stock over a specified period of time, which vest over a period of time as established by the Committee, without satisfaction of any performance criteria or objectives. The Committee may, in its discretion, require payment or other conditions of the Participant respecting any Phantom Stock Award. A Phantom Stock Award may include, without limitation, a Stock Appreciation Right that is granted independently of an Option. 

^^*Award Period*. The Committee shall establish, with respect to and at the time of each Phantom Stock Award, a period over which the Award shall vest with respect to the Participant. 

^^*Awards Criteria*. In determining the value of Phantom Stock Awards, the Committee shall take into account a Participant’s responsibility level, performance, potential, other Awards, and such other considerations as it deems appropriate. 

^^*Payment*. Following the end of the vesting period for a Phantom Stock Award (or at such other time as the applicable Phantom Stock Award Agreement may provide), the holder of a Phantom Stock Award shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount, not exceeding the maximum value of the Phantom Stock Award, based on the then vested value of the Award. Payment of a Phantom Stock Award may be made in cash, Common Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee. Payment shall be made in a lump sum or in installments as prescribed by the Committee. Any payment to be made in cash shall be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date or such other date as may be specified by the Committee in the Phantom Stock Award Agreement. Cash dividend equivalents may be paid during or after the vesting period with respect to a Phantom Stock Award, as determined by the Committee. 

^^*Termination of Award*. A Phantom Stock Award shall terminate if the Participant does not remain continuously in the employ of the Company and its Affiliates or does not continue to perform services as a Consultant or a Director for the Company and its Affiliates at all times during the applicable vesting period, except as may be otherwise determined by the Committee. 

^^*Phantom Stock Award Agreements*. At the time any Award is made under this Paragraph X, the Company and the Participant shall enter into a Phantom Stock Award Agreement setting forth each of the matters contemplated hereby, and such additional matters as the Committee may determine to be appropriate. The terms and provisions of the respective Phantom Stock Award Agreements need not be identical. 

\centered XI. BONUS STOCK AWARDS 

Each Bonus Stock Award granted to a Participant shall constitute a transfer of unrestricted Common Stock on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Bonus Stock Awards shall be made in shares of Common Stock and need not be subject to performance criteria or objectives or to forfeiture. The purchase price, if any, for Common Stock issued in connection with a Bonus Stock Award shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Bonus Stock Awards may be utilized to grant Common Stock in lieu of obligations to pay cash or deliver other property under this Plan or under other plans or compensatory arrangements, provided that, in the case of Executive Officers, the amount of such grants remains within the discretion of the Committee to the extent necessary to ensure that acquisitions of Stock or other Awards are exempt from liability under Rule 16b-3. In the case of any grant of Common Stock to an officer of the Company or any of its Affiliates in lieu of salary or other cash compensation, the number of shares granted in place of such compensation shall be reasonable, as determined by the Committee. 

^^^^^ 
\centered XII. RECAPITALIZATION OR REORGANIZATION 

^^*No Effect on Right or Power*. The existence of the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s or any Affiliate’s capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company or any Affiliate, any issue of debt or equity securities ahead of or affecting Common Stock or the rights thereof, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Affiliate or any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or any part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding. 

^^*Subdivision or Consolidation of Shares; Stock Dividends*. The shares with respect to which Awards may be granted are shares of Common Stock as presently constituted, but if, and whenever, prior to the expiration of an Award theretofore granted, the Company shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of shares of Common Stock or the payment of a stock dividend on Common Stock without receipt of consideration by the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which such Award may thereafter be exercised or satisfied, as applicable (i) in the event of an increase in the number of outstanding shares shall be proportionately increased, and the purchase price per share shall be proportionately reduced, and (ii) in the event of a reduction in the number of outstanding shares shall be proportionately reduced, and the purchase price per share shall be proportionately increased. Any fractional share resulting from such adjustment shall be rounded up to the next whole share. 

^^*Recapitalizations and Corporate Changes*. If the Company recapitalizes, reclassifies its capital stock, or otherwise changes its capital structure (a **“*recapitalization*”**), the number and class of shares of Common Stock covered by an Award theretofore granted shall be adjusted so that such Award shall thereafter cover the number and class of shares of stock and securities to which the Participant would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the recapitalization if, immediately prior to the recapitalization, the Participant had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Common Stock then covered by such Award. If (i) the Company shall not be the surviving entity in any merger or consolidation (or survives only as a subsidiary of an entity), (ii) the Company sells, leases or exchanges or agrees to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of its assets to any other person or entity, (iii) the Company is to be dissolved and liquidated, (iv) any person or entity, including a “group” as contemplated by Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934 Act, acquires or gains ownership or control (including, without limitation, power to vote) of more than [[Percentage 1]]% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s voting stock (based upon voting power), or (v) as a result of or in connection with a contested election of Directors, the persons who were Directors of the Company before such election shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board (each such event is referred to herein as a **“*Corporate Change*”**), no later than (A) 10 days after the approval by the stockholders of the Company of such merger, consolidation, reorganization, sale, lease or exchange of assets or dissolution or such election of Directors or (B) 30 days after a Corporate Change of the type described in clause (iv), the Committee, acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval of any Participant, shall effect one or more of the following alternatives, which alternatives may vary among individual Participants and which may vary among Options held by any individual Participant: (1) accelerate the time at which Options then outstanding may be exercised so that such Options may be exercised in full for a limited period of time on or before a specified date (before or after such Corporate Change) fixed by the Committee, after which specified date all unexercised Options and all rights of Participants thereunder shall terminate, (2) require the mandatory surrender to the Company by selected Participants of some or all of the outstanding Options held by such Participants (irrespective of whether such Options are then exercisable under the provisions of the Plan) as of a date, before or after such Corporate Change, specified by the Committee, in which event the Committee shall thereupon cancel such Options and the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to each Participant an amount of cash per share equal to the excess, if any, of the amount calculated in Subparagraph (d) below (the **“*Change of Control Value*”**) of the shares subject to such Option over the exercise price(s) under such Options for such shares, or (3) make such adjustments to Options then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Corporate Change (provided, however, that the Committee may determine in its sole discretion that no adjustment is necessary to Options then outstanding), including, without limitation, adjusting an Option to provide that the number and class of shares of Common Stock covered by such Option shall be adjusted so that such Option shall thereafter cover securities of the surviving or acquiring corporation or other property (including, without limitation, cash) as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 

^^^^^ 
^^*Change of Control Value*. For the purposes of clause (2) in Subparagraph (c) above, the “Change of Control Value” shall equal the amount determined in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), whichever is applicable, as follows: (i) the per share price offered to stockholders of the Company in any such merger, consolidation, sale of assets or dissolution transaction, (ii) the price per share offered to stockholders of the Company in any tender offer or exchange offer whereby a Corporate Change takes place, or (iii) if such Corporate Change occurs other than pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, the fair market value per share of the shares into which such Options being surrendered are exercisable, as determined by the Committee as of the date determined by the Committee to be the date of cancellation and surrender of such Options. In the event that the consideration offered to stockholders of the Company in any transaction described in this Subparagraph (d) or Subparagraph (c) above consists of anything other than cash, the Committee shall determine the fair cash equivalent of the portion of the consideration offered which is other than cash. 

^^*Other Changes in the Common Stock*. In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of recapitalizations, reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, exchanges or other relevant changes in capitalization or distributions to the holders of Common Stock occurring after the date of the grant of any Award and not otherwise provided for by this Paragraph XII such Award and any agreement evidencing such Award shall be subject to adjustment by the Committee at its sole discretion as to the number and price of shares of Common Stock or other consideration subject to such Award. In the event of any such change in the outstanding Common Stock or distribution to the holders of Common Stock, or upon the occurrence of any other event described in this Paragraph XII the aggregate number of shares available under the Plan, the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the Plan through Incentive Stock Options, and the maximum number of shares that may be subject to Awards granted to any one individual may be appropriately adjusted to the extent, if any, determined by the Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, upon the occurrence of a Corporate Change, the Committee, acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval of any Participant, may require the mandatory surrender to the Company by selected Participants of some or all of the outstanding Performance Awards, Annual Incentive Awards and Phantom Stock Awards as of a date, before or after such Corporate Change, specified by the Committee, in which event the Committee shall thereupon cancel such Performance Awards, Annual Incentive Awards and Phantom Stock Awards and the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to each Participant an amount of cash equal to the maximum value (which maximum value may be determined, if applicable and in the discretion of the Committee, based on the then Fair Market Value of the Common Stock) of such Performance Award, Annual Incentive Awards or Phantom Stock Award which, in the event the applicable performance or vesting period set forth in such Performance Award, Annual Incentive Award or Phantom Stock Award has not been completed, shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the period beginning on the first day of the applicable performance or vesting period and ending on the date of the surrender, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of days in the applicable performance or vesting period; provided, however, that the Committee will not take any such action with regard to Performance Awards and Annual Incentive Awards that are intended to be “performance-based compensation” under section 162(m) of the Code that would cause such Awards to fail to comply with section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 

^^*Stockholder Action*. Any adjustment provided for in the above Subparagraphs of this Paragraph XII shall be subject to any required stockholder action. 

^^*No Adjustments unless Otherwise Provided*. Except as hereinbefore expressly provided, the issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash, property, labor or services, upon direct sale, upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, and in any case whether or not for fair value, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to Awards theretofore granted or the purchase price per share, if applicable. 

^^^^^ 
\centered XIII. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN 

The Board in its discretion may terminate the Plan at any time with respect to any shares of Common Stock for which Awards have not theretofore been granted. The Board shall have the right to alter or amend the Plan or any part thereof from time to time; provided that no change in the Plan may be made that would impair the rights of a Participant with respect to an Award theretofore granted without the consent of the Participant, and provided, further, that the Board may not, without approval of the stockholders of the Company, (a) amend the Plan to increase the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the Plan, increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan through Incentive Stock Options or change the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, or (b) amend or delete Paragraph VII(f).
