^Payment by the Subscribing Reinsurer of its portion of loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses paid by the Company shall be made by the Subscribing Reinsurer to the Company immediately upon reasonable evidence of the amount due or to be deemed being furnished by the Company.

ARTICLE XIV  LOSS ADJUSTMENT AND SETTLEMENT 

The Company shall give notice, as soon as practicable, to the Subscribing Reinsurer of any claim that it has reason to believe could involve this Agreement. The Company shall keep the Subscribing Reinsurer informed of significant developments likely to affect the cost of any claim or claims hereunder. 

The Company may commence, continue, defend, settle, or withdraw from actions, suits, or prosecutions and, generally, do all such things relating to any claim or loss in which the Subscribing Reinsurer is interested as, in the Company’s judgment, may be beneficial or expedient to the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer. The Company shall be the sole judge as to what claims are covered under its Policies. All of the Company’s Ultimate Net Loss (and loss occurrences), as well as all loss settlements made and judgments paid by the Company, provided they are within the terms of this Agreement either under the strict conditions of the Company’s Policies or by way of compromise, shall be unconditionally binding upon the Subscribing Reinsurer, who agrees to pay all amounts for which they are liable immediately upon reasonable evidence of the amount due being furnished to the Subscribing Reinsurer by the Company. The true intent of this Agreement is that the Subscribing Reinsurer shall, in every case to which this Agreement applies, follow the settlements of the Company. 

ARTICLE XV  SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION  
The Reinsurers shall be credited with their share of salvage and/or subrogation in respect of claims and settlements under this Agreement, less their share of recovery expense. Unless the Company and Reinsurers agree to the contrary, the Company shall enforce its right to salvage and/or subrogation and shall prosecute all claims arising out of such right. Should the Company refuse or neglect to enforce this right, the Reinsurers are hereby empowered and authorized to institute appropriate action in the name of the Company. 

Amounts recovered from salvage and/or subrogation shall always be used to reimburse the excess Reinsurers (and the Company, should it carry a portion of excess coverage net) in the reverse order of their participation in the loss before being used in any way to reimburse the Company for its primary loss. If the amount recovered exceeds the recovery expense, the recovery expense shall be borne by each party in proportion to its benefit from the recovery. If the recovery expense exceeds the amount recovered, the amount recovered (if any) shall be applied to the reimbursement of recovery expense and the remaining expense, as well as any originally incurred loss expense, shall be added to the Ultimate Net

ARTICLE XVI  ACCESS TO RECORDS  
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the Subscribing Reinsurer, or its duly authorized representative, may upon reasonable prior written notice to the Company, at Subscribing Reinsurer’s own expense, examine at the offices of the Company, during normal office hours, the Company’s Policy, accounting, underwriting, or claim records and files, or any such additional relevant records and files, as they exist in the Company’s possession or reasonable control, relating to business ceded under this Agreement. The Subscribing Reinsurer’s notice shall reasonably describe the nature of the inspection that it wishes to conduct, the persons conducting the inspection and upon notice of available files from the Company, the files that it wishes to review. Subject to the limitations expressed in this Article, this right of inspection shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall continue as long as either Party has any rights or obligations under this Agreement. 

The Company reserves the right to deny the Subscribing Reinsurer access to records or files concerning any particular claim(s) if the Subscribing Reinsurer has not disputed liability for payment of such claim(s), and payment of such claim(s) is more than ninety (90) days overdue according to the Company’s records. The Company shall, however, prior to an arbitration demand that may be instituted by either party, continue to respond to reasonable specific requests for information and questions raised by the Subscribing Reinsurer concerning such claims; and nothing in this Article shall restrict the right or ability of the Subscribing Reinsurer to seek discovery of relevant information in an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the Arbitration Article of this Agreement. 

As a condition precedent to access to records under this Article, the Subscribing Reinsurer, its personnel and any authorized third party representative of the Subscribing Reinsurer shall agree to the provisions of the Confidentiality Article of this Agreement. 

The Company reserves the right to withhold any documents from Subscribing Reinsurer (a) concerning Trade Secrets of the Company, (b) subject to the terms of a third party non-disclosure agreement with the Company requiring third party consent to disclosure, (c) subject to the Work Product Privilege or Attorney-Client Privilege or (d) concerning individual private information that as a matter of law cannot be disclosed by the Company (hereinafter referred to in the Agreement as “Privileged Documents”). The Company shall reasonably try to exempt the Reinsurers from any third party non-disclosure agreement or obtain consent from the third party to disclose to the Subscribing Reinsurer. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall permit and not object to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s access to Privileged Documents in connection with the underlying claim reinsured hereunder following final settlement or final adjudication of the case or cases involving such claim, with prejudice against all claimants, and all parties to such adjudications; provided that the Company, may defer release of such Privileged Documents if there are subrogation, contribution, or other third party actions with respect to that claim or case, which might jeopardize the Company’s defense by release of such Privileged Documents. In the event that the Company shall seek to defer release of such Privileged Documents, it will in consultation with the Subscribing Reinsurer take other steps as reasonably necessary to provide the Subscribing Reinsurer with the information it reasonably requires to indemnify the Company without causing a loss of such privileges. The Subscribing Reinsurer, however, shall not have access to Privileged Documents relating to any dispute between the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer. 

For purposes of this Article, “Trade Secrets” shall have the meaning provided in Section 1839 of the United States Economic Espionage Act of 1996. “Attorney-Client Privilege” shall mean communications of a confidential nature between a) the Company, or anyone retained or in the control of the Company, or its in-house or outside legal counsel, or anyone in the control of such legal counsel, and b) any in-house or

ARTICLE XVII  DIVIDENDS AND TAXES

ARTICLE XVIll  FEDERAL EXCISE TAX  
This Article is applicable to any Subscribing Reinsurer who is domiciled outside of the United States of America, except for any Subscribing Reinsurer exempt from Federal Excise Tax. A Subscribing Reinsurer that claims exempt status from Federal Excise Tax shall provide to the Company, upon its request, proof that the exempt status adequately satisfies the demands of the U.S. Internal Revenue Agency and/or other applicable U.S. government authority. 

Each Subscribing Reinsurer shall allow the applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as imposed under Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code) for the purpose of paying Federal Excise Tax to the extent such premium is subject to such tax. 

In the event of any return of premium, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall deduct the aforesaid percentage from the return premium payable hereon and the Company or its agent shall recover such tax from the United States Government. 

ARTICLE XIX  GOVERNING LAW  
The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New Hampshire. 

ARTICLE XX  CURRENCY  
Whenever a reference to a monetary currency appears in this Agreement, it shall be construed to mean United States Dollars (“USD”). However, in those cases where the Policies are issued by the Company using Canadian Dollars (“CAD”), it shall mean Canadian Dollars. All payments made by either party shall be made in United States Dollars except that payments made involving Policies issued using Canadian Dollars shall be made in Canadian Dollars. 

ARTICLE XXI  OFFSET

however, that in the event of insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be allowed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, statute, or regulation governing such offset. 

ARTICLE XXII  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS  
Any inadvertent delay, omission, or error in complying with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be held to relieve either party hereto from any liability, which would attach to it hereunder if such delay, omission, or error had not been made, provided such delay, omission, or error is rectified upon discovery. 

ARTICLE XXIII  INSOLVENCY  
(If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of “Company” in the Preamble to this Agreement, this Article shall apply severally to each such company. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company intended to be covered hereunder. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company intended to be covered hereunder, that domiciliary state’s laws shall prevail.) 

In the event of the insolvency of the Company, reinsurance under this Agreement shall be payable on demand, with reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of claims allowed against the insolvent Company by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor of the Company having authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of such insolvency or because such liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Such payments by the Subscribing Reinsurer shall be made directly to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except to the extent Section 4118(a) of the New York Insurance Law applies, or except (a) where the Agreement specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company, or (b) where the Subscribing Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Subscribing Reinsurer to the payees under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. 

It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor of the insolvent Company shall give written notice to the Subscribing Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the insolvent Company on the Policy or Policies reinsured within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding and that during the pendency of such claim the Subscribing Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Subscribing Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Company as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit, which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Subscribing Reinsurer. 

Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elects to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as though such expense had been incurred by the insolvent Company. 

ARTICLE XXIV  MEDIATION  
^In the event of any dispute or difference of opinion arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement, whether such dispute arises before or after the expiration of this Agreement, the Company and the

^Each party shall submit a list of not more than four (4) potential mediators to the other party within the fourteen (14) days of reaching such mutual agreement. The two parties shall then agree on the appointment on one (1) mediator from the combined lists within seven (7) days. The mediator shall be a neutral, impartial third party, without past employment or directorial relationships with the parties to the mediation. Such mediator shall make full disclosure of all past partisan relationships with either the Company or Subscribing Reinsurer to the parties within seven (7) days of his or her notification that he or she has been selected as a Mediator.

^If the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer cannot agree on a mediator within twenty one (21) days from the date of a mutual agreement to mediate, then arbitration proceedings may commence in accordance with the Arbitration Article.

^The mediator will schedule an initial mediation session within thirty (30) days of his or her appointment and will be responsible for the formulation of an agenda to be distributed to the parties involved in the mediation not less than five (5) days before the mediation commences.

^The mediator will not have the power of enforcement of any agreement between the parties nor will the mediator have any right to assess any damages, including punitive damages, to either party participating in the mediation.

^If, in the opinion of the mediator, the parties cannot resolve the dispute or difference of opinion, Arbitration proceedings may commence in accordance with the Arbitration Article. In any event, the mediation shall conclude within sixty (60) days of its referral to the mediator. Should the mediation not be resolved in sixty (60) days, then arbitration proceedings may commence in accordance with the Arbitration Article.

^Each party shall bear the expense of its own representatives and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the expenses of the mediator and the place of mediation.

ARTICLE XXV  ARBITRATION  
^Disputes to be Arbitrated. With the exception of any dispute resolution procedures regarding commutation that are otherwise contained in this Agreement and any mutual agreement to initially mediate any dispute pursuant to the Mediation Article, any and all disputes between the Company and any Subscribing Reinsurer or Reinsurers (“Party” individually or “Parties” collectively) arising out of, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, whether sounding in contract or tort and whether arising during or after this Agreement’s formation, or after its termination, including disputes as to whether the Agreement was validly formed or is voidable, shall be submitted to the decision of an arbitration panel (“Panel”). The Panel shall consist of an umpire and two party-appointed arbitrators unless a Party meets the requirements of Paragraph C of this Article and demands arbitration pursuant thereto, in which case the Panel would consist of an umpire only.

^Procedures. Except as provided herein, any arbitration shall be based upon the Procedures for the resolution of U.S. Insurance and Reinsurance Disputes, Regular Panel Version, dated [[Date 7: Date]] (the “Procedures”), developed by the Insurance and Reinsurance Dispute Resolution Task Force, subject to the following modifications:

^Qualifications of the arbitrators and umpires shall be in accordance with Alternative section 6.2 of the Procedures.

\centered 

Agreement No. RAM Re BSGPX  2006    13.  

^^^^^ 
^The Parties hereby designate the umpire list maintained by [[Organization 7 Name]] (U.S.) as the list to be used in the event that section 6.7(a) of the Procedures is invoked.

^Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the members of the Panel shall be impartial and disinterested. The members of the Panel may not be: (1) in the control of any Party or its parent, affiliate, or agent, (2) a former director or officer of any Party or its parent, affiliate, or agent, or (3) a likely witness in the arbitration. The requirement of impartiality means that all members of the Panel shall have the same obligation to approach the Panel’s duties and decisions with fairness and without consideration for the fact that Panel members may have been appointed by one of the Parties. The requirement of impartiality does not mean that any arbitrator can have no previous knowledge of or experience with respect to issues involved in the dispute or disputes.

^The first sentence of Section 10.4 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following sentence: “The Panel shall require that each Party submit concise written statements of position, including summaries of the facts and evidence a Party intends to present, discussion of the applicable law and the basis for the requested Award or denial of relief sought.”

^Once the Panel has been constituted, no Party (or anyone acting for a Party) shall have any communications concerning the arbitration or any of the issues before the Panel with any member of the Panel that is not also disclosed to all other Parties and all members of the Panel. Each Panel member shall have a continuing duty to disclose promptly to all Parties and all Panel members any violation of this prohibition and the specifics of any improper communications that occurred. This prohibition shall remain in place until all challenges to any arbitration awards and decisions have been either waived or finally concluded.

^Section 11.1 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following provision: “The Parties may propound discovery seeking disclosure of such information and/or documents relevant to the dispute or necessary for the proper resolution of the dispute.”

^Position statements may be amended at any reasonable time, but not later than the close of discovery without a showing to the Panel that the amending Party could not reasonably have raised the new claim or issue at an earlier time.

^The Panel shall hold an evidentiary hearing, if one is necessary, within one year of the arbitration demand, unless the Parties otherwise agree. Should a Party seek a reasonable extension to this time frame for good cause shown, the other Party’s agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^To the extent permitted by the law, the Panel shall have the authority to issue subpoenas and other orders to enforce its decisions.

^The Panel may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and arbitration costs to the prevailing Party, as determined by the Panel.

^Section 14.3 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following provision: “The Panel shall make a decision and issue an award with regard to the terms expressed in this Agreement, and the custom and practice of the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance business. The Panel shall not be obligated to follow the strict rules of law and evidence.”

^Alternative Streamlined Procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, the Alternative Streamlined Procedures set forth in section 16 of the Procedures, as modified by sections B3, B4, and B9 through B11 of this Article, shall apply in the event that, in a consolidated proceeding or otherwise, the Party initiating arbitration is seeking payment of a total amount that is no greater than one million dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]), or the currency equivalent thereof. Sections 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and the second sentence of section 16.4 of the Alternative Streamlined Procedures shall not apply. The Parties agree to comply with section 6.7 of the Procedures to appoint a single umpire, and hereby designate the umpire list maintained by [[Organization 7 Name]] (U.S.) as the list to be used in section 6.7(a).

^Hearing Location. The hearing shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the Parties mutually agree to a different location.

^Confirmation. Either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order confirming any award of the Panel; a judgment of that court shall thereupon be entered on any award. If such an order is issued, the Party against whom confirmation is sought shall pay the attorneys’ fees incurred of the Party who applied for the confirmation order and all court costs of any such proceeding.

^Equitable Relief from a Court of Law. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any participating Party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a restraining order or other equitable relief to maintain the “status quo” of the Parties participating in the arbitration pending the decision and award by the Panel.

^Consolidated Proceedings.

^*Same agreement, single Subscribing Reinsurer.* Both the Company and any single Subscribing Reinsurer on this Agreement have the right to combine any and all disputes between them that concern this Agreement (including any renewal of this Agreement or any agreement for which this Agreement is a renewal) into a single arbitration proceeding before a single Panel, except that the standard for determining whether a Party may add a new issue, claim, or dispute to an arbitration proceeding shall be the standard for amending a Position statement, as set forth in Paragraph B7 of this Article.

^*Multiple agreements, single Subscribing Reinsurer.* The Company has the right to combine any and all disputes between the Company and a single Subscribing Reinsurer into a single arbitration proceeding before a single Panel where such disputes involve this Agreement and any additional agreements between the two Parties, except that the standard for determining whether a Party may add a new issue, claim, or dispute to an arbitration proceeding shall be the standard for amending a Position statement, as set forth in Paragraph B7 of this Article.

^*Same agreement, multiple Reinsurers.* At the Company’s option, if more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in arbitration relating to this Agreement, where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Reinsurers shall constitute and act as one Party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Reinsurers constituting the one Party; provided, however, that the Reinsurers shall have the right to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, and to be represented by separate counsel. This provision shall not change the liability of each of the Reinsurers under the terms of this Agreement from several to joint.

^Choice of Law. The law set forth in the Governing Law Article shall apply to this Arbitration Article. In addition, to the extent the Panel (or the umpire in an Alternative Streamlined Procedure) looks to applicable law, such Panel or umpire shall apply the law as set forth in the Governing Law Article of this Agreement.

^Survival of Article. This Article shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

^^^^^ 
^ SPECIAL CONDITIONS  
The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time by the giving of 30 days prior notice in writing to the Subscribing Reinsurer upon the happening of any one of the following circumstances: 

^A State Insurance Department or other legal authority orders the Subscribing Reinsurer to cease writing business; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer has become insolvent or has been placed into liquidation or receivership (whether voluntary or involuntary) or there have been instituted against it proceedings for the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, rehabilitator, conservator, trustee in bankruptcy, or other agent known by whatever name, to take possession of its assets or control of its operations; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer’s policyholders’ surplus has been reduced by [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the amount of surplus at the inception of this Agreement; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer has become merged with, acquired or controlled by any company, corporation, or individual(s) not controlling the Reinsurer’s operations at the inception of this Agreement; or

^The Subscribing Reinsurer’s A.M. Best Rating has been assigned or downgraded below A- or Standard and Poor’s Counterparty Credit and Financial Strength rating has been assigned or downgraded below A-.

The coverage afforded by this Agreement shall cease as of the date of termination and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall return the unearned premium, if any. If coverage hereunder terminates while a claim covered by this Agreement is in progress, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall be liable subject to all other conditions hereof for its proportion of the entire claim, provided that the event giving rise to the claim started before such termination. 

If the Company elects to terminate this Agreement, the Company shall have the option to commute the Subscribing Reinsurer’s liability for loss(es), whether reported or unreported, comprising the sum total of the present value of the ceded (1) case reserves and allocated loss adjustment expense, (2) projected ultimate losses, (3) any unearned premium reserve, and (4) undiscounted outstanding paid claims (hereinafter the “Commutation Losses”), on Policies covered by this Agreement as of the effective date of termination. 

^The Company shall submit a statement of valuation showing the elements considered reasonable to establish the Commutation Losses, and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall pay the amount requested. In the event the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer cannot agree on the statement of valuation of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s liability under such Policies, either party may request in writing that the differences be settled by a panel of three actuaries. Each party shall appoint an actuary to assess such liability within 15 days after receipt of the written request for commutation. Upon such appointment, the two actuaries shall appoint a third actuary. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the third actuary within 30 days of their appointment, each of them shall nominate three individuals, of whom the other shall decline two, and the final decision shall be made by drawing lots. The actuaries shall then investigate and capitalize such Commutation Loss (es) within 30 days. As used herein, “capitalize” shall mean to determine the present value of Commutation Losses, without regard to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s ability to pay such losses. The panel shall meet in Boston Massachusetts, unless the Company and Subscribing Reinsurer agree otherwise.

^All actuaries shall be disinterested in the outcome of the commutation and shall be Fellows of the Society of Actuaries/Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society. Except as stated below, the expense of the actuaries and of the commutation shall be equally divided between the parties of the commutation.

^The decision in writing of the actuaries, when filed with the parties hereto, shall be final and binding, except that if the Company does not agree with the capitalized value of the Commutation Loss(es), the Company shall have no obligation to commute. In the event the Company does not agree with the capitalized value of the Commutation Loss(es) and does not move forward with commutation, the expense of the actuaries [including reasonable expense of the actuary appointed by the Subscribing Reinsurer] will be paid by the Company. If the Agreement is commuted, payment by the Subscribing Reinsurer to the Company or any other third party mutually agreed upon by the Subscribing Reinsurer and the Company shall constitute a complete and final release of the Subscribing Reinsurer in respect to its liability under this Agreement.

Termination under the terms of this Article can be made after the date of expiration of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XXVII  THIRD PARTIES  
This Agreement shall not be deemed to give any right or remedy to any third party whatsoever unless said right or remedy is specifically granted to such third party by the terms of this Agreement. 

ARTICLE XXVIII  UNAUTHORIZED REINSURANCE 

(Applies only to a Subscribing Reinsurer who does not qualify for full credit with any insurance regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company’s reserves.) 

As regards Policies or bonds issued by the Company coming within the scope of this Agreement, the Company agrees that when it shall file with the insurance regulatory authority or set up on its books reserves for unearned premium and losses covered hereunder which it shall be required by law to set up, it will forward to the Subscribing Reinsurer a statement showing the proportion of such reserves which is applicable to the Subscribing Reinsurer. The Subscribing Reinsurer hereby agrees to fund such reserves in respect of unearned premium, known outstanding losses that have been reported to the Subscribing Reinsurer and allocated loss adjustment expense relating thereto, losses and allocated loss adjustment expense paid by the Company but not recovered from the Subscribing Reinsurer, plus reserves for losses incurred but not reported as determined by the Company, as shown in the statement prepared by the Company (hereinafter referred to as “ Subscribing Reinsurer Obligations”) by Letters of Credit unless the method of funding is determined by applicable law, statute, or regulation. 

The Subscribing Reinsurer agrees to apply for and secure timely delivery to the Company of clean, irrevocable, and unconditional Letters of Credit issued by a bank that is a qualified U.S. financial institution and containing provisions acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company’s reserves in an amount equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s proportion of said reserves. At the Company’s request, Subscribing Reinsurer will agree to provide separate Letters of Credit for any distinct legal entities within the Company covered under this Agreement. Such Letters of Credit shall be issued for a period of not less than one year, and shall be automatically extended for one year from its date of expiration or any future expiration date unless 60 days prior to any expiration date the issuing bank shall notify the Company by certified mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the Letters of Credit extended for any additional period.

^To reimburse the Company for the Subscribing Reinsurer’s share of premiums returned to the owners of Policies reinsured under this Agreement because of cancellations of the Policies;

^To reimburse the Company for the Subscribing Reinsurer’s share of surrenders and benefits or losses paid by the Company under provisions of the Policies reinsured under this Agreement;

^To fund an account with the Company in an amount, at least, equal to the deduction for reinsurance ceded from the Company liabilities for Policies ceded under this Agreement. The account shall include, but not be limited to, amounts for Policy reserves, claims and losses incurred (including losses incurred but not reported), loss adjustment expenses, and unearned premium reserves; and

^To pay any other amounts the Company claims are due under this Agreement.

The issuing bank shall have no responsibility whatsoever in connection with the propriety of withdrawals made by the Company or the disposition of funds withdrawn, except to ensure that withdrawals are made only upon the order of properly authorized representatives of the Company. 

At annual intervals or more frequently as agreed, but never more frequently than quarterly, the Company shall prepare a specific statement of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations, for the sole purpose of amending the Letters of Credit, in the following manner: 

^If the statement shows that the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations exceed the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such excess, secure delivery to the Company of an amendment to the Letters of Credit increasing the amount of credit by the amount of such difference.

^If, however, the statement shows that the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations are less than the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Company shall, within 30 days after receipt of written request from the Subscribing Reinsurer, release such excess credit by agreeing to secure an amendment to the Letters of Credit reducing the amount of credit available by the amount of such excess credit.

ARTICLE XXVIX  SERVICE OF SUIT  
(This article applies to unauthorized Reinsurers and to Reinsurers who are domiciled outside the United States of America.) 

This Service of Suit Article will not be read to conflict with or override the obligations of the parties to arbitrate their disputes as provided for in the Arbitration Article. This Article is intended as an aid to compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or arbitral award, not as an alternative to the Arbitration Article for resolving disputes arising out of this Agreement.

In the event of the failure of the Subscribing Reinsurer to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, the Subscribing Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s right to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States. The Subscribing Reinsurer, once the appropriate Court is selected, whether such court is the one originally chosen by the Company and accepted by the Subscribing Reinsurer or is determined by removal, transfer, or otherwise, as provided for above, will comply with all requirements necessary to give said Court jurisdiction and, in any suit instituted against any of them upon this Agreement, will abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal. 

Service of process in such suit may be made upon **[[Organization 8 Name]], LLP, [[Address 1: Address]]-6829.** 

The above-named are authorized and directed to accept service of process on behalf of the Subscribing Reinsurer in any such suit.

Subscribing Reinsurer acknowledges and agrees that with respect to any review of Confidential Information by Subscribing Reinsurer, and/or discussion of Confidential Information, Company does not waive and does not intend to waive any available privilege or protection.

The Company and Subscribing Reinsurer agree that no confidentiality obligations will apply to Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information: (1) is or becomes available to the public, other than as a result of impermissible disclosure by the Subscribing Reinsurer, (2) was or became available lawfully to Subscribing Reinsurer from a source, other than Company or its personnel, that is not subject to a confidentiality obligation, (3) was developed independently by Subscribing Reinsurer prior to disclosure by Company or its personnel, as demonstrated by Subscribing Reinsurer’s records, or (4) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, court, or regulatory agency action.

Non-Public Personally Identifiable Information. Additionally, any disclosure of non-public personally identifiable information shall comply with all state and federal statutes and regulations governing the disclosure of non-public personally identifiable information. “Non-public personally identifiable information” is financial or medical information of or concerning a private person which either has been obtained from sources which are not available to the general public or obtained from the person who is the subject and which information is included in data files exchanged by the parties hereto.

The Company shall bear the cost of resisting the release of the Confidential Information. 

Survival. The parties agree that the obligations contained in this Article shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

^^^^^ 
^If a loss payment owed by the Subscribing Reinsurer to the Company is not received within 45 calendar days following the date of presentation to the Subscribing Reinsurer of information necessary to approve payment of the claim, and/or

^If any premium payment owed by the Company to the Subscribing Reinsurer is not received within 45 calendar days following the date on which payment is due, and/or

^If any premium adjustment, agreed by either party to the other, is not received within 150 calendar days following the expiry or anniversary of this Agreement, and/or

^If any return of premiums, commissions, profit sharing, or any amounts not provided in paragraphs A, B, and C above, are not received in accordance with the date specified in this Agreement or if no date is specified, within 90 calendar days following the date the debtor party received the billing.

Failure by the Subscribing Reinsurer or Company to comply with their respective payment obligations within the time periods as herein provided shall, as of that date, be subject to an interest payment computed by multiplying the amount due by a variable rate consisting of the U.S. Prime Rate as published in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal on the first day of the calendar month in which the amount became past due, plus [[Percentage 5: Number]]%. The variable rate shall be adjusted monthly thereafter to equal the U.S. Prime Rate as published in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal on the first day of each successive month during which the amount due remains unpaid, plus [[Percentage 5]]%. The product shall then be multiplied by 1/365 for each day after the due date that the amount due and the interest amount remain unpaid. Any interest that occurs pursuant to this Article shall be calculated by the party to which it is owed. 

The validity of any claim or payment may be contested under the provisions of this Agreement. If the debtor party prevails in an arbitration or any other proceeding with respect to the amounts in dispute, there shall be no interest penalty due. If the creditor party wholly or partially prevails on any of the amounts in dispute, the interest penalty shall be awarded as outlined above. Such interest penalty shall be calculated from the date the monies were due and owing to the date of resolution of the arbitration or proceeding, and shall be payable as of the date of resolution of the arbitration or proceeding. 

If a Subscribing Reinsurer advances the entire or partial payment of any claim it is contesting, and wholly or partially prevails in the contest, the Company shall promptly return the applicable amount of such payment. The arbitrator(s) hearing such dispute shall determine if interest shall be added to the amount returned by the Company. 

Any interest owing pursuant to this Article may be waived by the party to which it is owed. Further, any interest calculated pursuant to this Article that is $[[USD Value 15: Number]] or less shall be waived. Any waiver of any interest pursuant to this paragraph, however, shall not affect the waiving party’s right to claim and/or pursue interest for any other failure by the other party to make payment when due under this Article. 

ARTICLE XXXIV  ASSIGNMENT  
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer and their respective successors and assigns provided, however, that this Agreement may not be assigned by either the Company or the Subscribing Reinsurer without the prior written consent of the other.

\centered TERRORISM EXCLUSION CLAUSE (LM-02300-2005.06.27-A) 

This Agreement does not apply to and specifically excludes terrorism-related losses as follows: 

^For risks located in the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and at the premises of any United States mission as such terms are intended to apply under the terms of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as it may be amended from time-to-time:

^“Insured Losses” resulting, directly or indirectly, from a “Certified Act of Terrorism” under the terms of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 as it may be amended from time- to-time.

^Loss or damage, directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Other Act of Terrorism. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall extend to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Other Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; but, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Other Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device.

“Other Act of Terrorism” as used in this subparagraph A.2. above shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that results in physical loss or damage that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States government by coercion, which is not a “Certified Act of Terrorism” under the terms of TRIA. 

^For risks located within the United Kingdom, this Agreement shall not cover:

^Loss, destruction, or damage in Great Britain (being England, Wales, and Scotland) occasioned by or happening through or as a direct or indirect consequence of an Act of Terrorism.

^Loss, destruction, or damage in Northern Ireland within the meaning of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 or successors thereof.

In the event of an occurrence giving rise to a loss or losses payable by the Company not being certified by Her Majesty’s government or Her Majesty’s Treasury or any successor relevant Authority to have been an Act of Terrorism and solely by reason thereof the Company is unable to recover such loss or losses in whole or in part from Pool Reinsurance Company Limited, the Reinsurers accept that this subparagraph B.1. above does not apply to such loss or losses. 

For the purpose of this paragraph B:  
“Act of Terrorism” means an act of persons acting on behalf of or in connection with any organization that carries out activities directed towards the overthrowing or influencing by force or violence of Her Majesty’s government in the United Kingdom. 

This paragraph B shall not, however, apply to goods in transit or goods in temporary storage while in transit. 

^^^^^ 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph B excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Act of Terrorism. This Agreement shall extend, however, to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; but, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device. 

^For risks located in all other sovereignties not subject to paragraphs A or B above:

Loss or damage, directly or indirectly, caused by, contributed to by, resulting from, or arising out of or in connection with any Act of Terrorism, as defined in this paragraph C, regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss. 

For the purpose of this paragraph C:  
“Act of Terrorism” shall mean any violent act or act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that results in physical loss or damage that is committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of any nation or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the government of any such sovereign nation by coercion. 

Where an occurrence falling within the definition of Act of Terrorism in this paragraph C, involving risks insured or reinsured in Consorcio, Gareat, Extremus, the Australian Terrorism Pool {or any similar scheme formed during the term of this Agreement) gives rise to a loss or losses payable by the Company and such occurrence is not certified by the individual authority acting respectively for Consorcio, Gareat, Extremus, the Australian Terrorism Pool (or any similar scheme formed during the term of this Agreement) having responsibility to make such judgment, or any successor authority, as an Act of Terrorism, the reinsurers accept that this exclusion does not apply to such loss(es). 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph C excludes loss or damage, directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological explosion, pollution, or contamination resulting from any Act of Terrorism. This Agreement shall extend, however, to cover insured physical loss or damage, excluding all time-element coverages and extensions, incurred as a direct and immediate consequence of an Act of Terrorism employing any non-nuclear weapon or device designed to disperse chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants; but, no coverage shall be afforded for any ensuing chemical, biological, or radiological contamination or pollution resulting from an Act of Terrorism employing such weapon or device.
