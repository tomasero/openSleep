^ \centered Agreement, if on the date of Employee’s separation from service Employee is a “specified employee,” as defined in Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent any amount payable under this Agreement upon Employee’s separation from service constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of Employee’s separation from service, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (i) the six-month anniversary of Employee’s separation from service or (ii) the date of Employee’s death.

^ \centered 19. If any of the provisions, terms, clauses, or waivers or releases of claims or rights contained in this Agreement, including without limitation Paragraphs 11 through 13 (inclusive), are declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or ineffective, it is the purpose and intent of the Parties that any such provisions be deemed modified or limited so that, as modified or limited, such provisions may be enforced to the fullest extent possible. In the event that such court determines that such provisions cannot be rendered enforceable through any such modification or limitation or otherwise declines to so modify or limit such provisions, such holding shall not invalidate the whole of this Agreement; instead, the Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain the invalid, illegal or unenforceable part, and the rights and obligation of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly; the remaining provisions, terms, clauses or waivers and release of claims or rights shall be deemed severable, such that all other provisions, terms, clauses and waivers and releases of claims and rights contained in this Agreement shall remain valid and binding. 

THE PARTIES STATE THAT THEY HAVE READ THE FOREGOING, THAT THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OF ITS TERMS AND THAT THEY INTEND TO BE BOUND THERETO.
