Any Escrow Claim shall be deemed to have occurred if received before the Escrow Termination Date by the Escrow Agent. The Parties shall provide advance written notice of the identity of the arbitrator to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 1.4.

^^Disbursements to Satisfy Escrow Claims. Escrow Agent shall release Escrow Shares within ten (10) business days after the following events: (i) in the case of Setoff, Escrow Agent shall release Escrow Shares to Purchaser, pursuant to, and following the receipt of, written request for delivery signed by each of the Parties stating the amount of the Escrow Claim, the identity of the Principal Vendor(s) who is/are liable to bear the amount of the Escrow Claim (and not any other Principal Vendor) (“**Breaching Principal Vendor**”) and the number of Escrow Shares attributable to the Breachin g Principal Vendors which will satisfy the amount of the Escrow Claim computed in accordance with this Section 1.4(b) (“**Relevant Escrow Shares**”); or (ii) in the case of an arbitration or other legal proceeding resulting in a final award or judgment, following Escrow Agent’s receipt of (1) written notice of the final award or judgment in the arbitration or other proceeding, from the prevailing Party or Parties, and (2) a copy of such final award or judgment; or (iii) in the case of an arbitration or other proceeding resulting in an award or judgment and where the Escrow Agent has filed an interpleader action with a court of competent jurisdiction, following Escrow Agent’s receipt of notice of the order of such court.
