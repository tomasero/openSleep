^^**Powers of the Administrator**. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator will have the authority, in its discretion:

^^^to determine the Fair Market Value;  
^^^to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder;

^^**Effect of Administrator’s Decision**. The Administrator’s decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards.

^**Eligibility**. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be granted to Service Providers.

^**Restricted Stock**.  
^^**Grant of Restricted Stock**. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Service Providers in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.

^^**Restricted Stock Agreement**. Each Award of Restricted Stock will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Period of Restriction, the number of Shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any Fiscal Year no Participant will receive more than an aggregate of [[Shares 1: Number]] Shares of Restricted Stock; provided, however, that in connection with a Participant’s initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted an aggregate of up to an additional [[Shares 2: Number]] Shares of Restricted Stock. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Shares of Restricted Stock will be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on such Shares have lapsed.

^^**Transferability**. Except as provided in this Section 6, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction.

^^**Other Restrictions**. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may impose such other restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock as it may deem advisable or appropriate.

^^**Removal of Restrictions**. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made under the Plan will be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, the Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed.

During the Period of Restriction, if dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to such dividends or distributions. The Shares received pursuant to any such dividend or distribution will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were issued.

^^**Return of Restricted Stock to Company**. On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which restrictions have not lapsed will revert to the Company and again will become available for grant under the Plan.

^^^**Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions**. For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator (which, for these purposes, will be a Committee established as set forth in Section 4(a)(ii)), in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Restricted Stock which is intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).

^**Restricted Stock Units**.  
^^**Grant**. Restricted Stock Units may be granted at any time and from time to time as determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any Fiscal Year no Participant will receive more than an aggregate of 50,000 Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that in connection with a Participant’s initial service as an Employee, an Employee may be granted an aggregate of up to an additional 100,000 Restricted Stock Units. After the Administrator determines that it will grant Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, it will advise the Participant in writing or electronically of the terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant, including the number of Restricted Stock Units and the form of payout, which, subject to Section 7(d), may be left to the discretion of the Administrator.

^^**Vesting Criteria and Other Terms**. The Administrator will set vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Participant. The Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment), or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.

^^**Earning Restricted Stock Units**. Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will be entitled to receive a payout as specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the grant of Restricted Stock Units, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any vesting criteria that must be met to receive a payout.

^^**Form and Timing of Payment**. Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) set forth in the Award Agreement. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares, or a combination thereof. Shares represented by Restricted Stock Units that are fully paid in cash again will be available for grant under the Plan.

^^**Cancellation**. On the date set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company.

^^**Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions**. For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock Units as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator (which, for these purposes, will be a Committee established as set forth in Section 4(a)(ii)), in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Restricted Stock which is intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).

^**Leaves of Absence**. Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary.

^**Transferability of Awards**. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.

^**Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control**.

^^**Adjustment of Awards and Authorized Shares**. The terms of an Award and the number of Shares authorized pursuant to Section 3 for issuance under the Plan and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 6 and 7 shall be subject to adjustment from time to time, in accordance with the following provisions:

^^^If at any time, or from time to time, the Company shall subdivide as a whole (by reclassification, by a stock split, by the issuance of a distribution on Shares payable in Shares, or otherwise) the number of Shares then outstanding into a greater number of Shares, then (i) the maximum number of Shares available for the Plan as provided in Section 3 and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 6 and 7 shall be increased proportionately, and the kind of shares or other securities available for the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted, (ii) the number of Shares (or other kind of shares or securities) that may be acquired under any Award shall be increased proportionately, and (iii) the price, if any, for each Share (or other kind of shares or securities) subject to then outstanding Awards shall be reduced proportionately, without changing the aggregate purchase price or value as to which outstanding Awards remain exercisable or subject to restrictions.

^^^If at any time, or from time to time, the Company shall consolidate as a whole (by reclassification, reverse stock split, or otherwise) the number of Shares then outstanding into a lesser number of Shares, then (i) the maximum number of Shares available for the Plan as provided in Section 3 and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 6 and 7 shall be decreased proportionately, and the kind of shares or other securities available for the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted, (ii) the number of Shares (or other kind of shares or securities) that may be acquired under any Award shall be decreased proportionately, and (iii) the price, if any, for each Share (or other kind of shares or securities) subject to then outstanding Awards shall be increased proportionately, without changing the aggregate purchase price, if any, or value as to which outstanding Awards remain exercisable or subject to restrictions.

^^^Whenever the number of Shares subject to outstanding Awards and the price, if any, for each Share subject to outstanding Awards are required to be adjusted as provided in this Section 10(a), the Administrator shall promptly prepare a notice setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated, and the change in price and the number of Shares, other securities, cash, or property purchasable subject to each Award after giving effect to the adjustments. The Administrator shall promptly give each Participant such a notice.

^^^Adjustments under Sections 10(a)(i) and 10(a)(ii) shall be made by the Administrator, and its determination as to what adjustments shall be made and the extent thereof shall be final, binding, and conclusive. No fractional interest shall be issued under the Plan on account of any such adjustments.

^^Except as set forth in Sections 10(a)(i) and 10(a)(ii), in the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, may (in its sole discretion) adjust the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 6 and 7.

^^**Dissolution or Liquidation**. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction.

^^**Change in Control**. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control the restriction period of any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall immediately be accelerated and the restrictions shall expire. If a Change in Control involves a Restructuring or occurs in connection with a series of related transactions involving a Restructuring and if such Restructuring is in the form of a Non-Surviving Event and as a part of such Restructuring Shares, other securities, cash, or property shall be issuable or deliverable in exchange for Shares, then the Participant shall be entitled to purchase or receive (in lieu of the Total Shares that the Participant would otherwise be entitled to purchase or receive), as appropriate for the form of Award, the number of Shares, other securities, cash, or property to which that number of Total Shares would have been entitled in connection with such Restructuring. Nothing in this Section 10(c) shall impose on Participant the obligation to exercise any Award immediately before or upon the Change of Control, or cause Participant to forfeit the right to exercise the Award during the remainder of the original term of the Award because of a Change in Control.

^^**Restructuring Without a Change in Control**. In the event a Restructuring shall occur at any time while there is any outstanding Award hereunder and that Restructuring does not occur in connection with a Change in Control or a series of related transactions involving a Change in Control, then:

^^^the restriction period of any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall not immediately be accelerated and the restrictions expire merely because of the occurrence of the Restructuring; and

^^^at the option of the Administrator, the Administrator may (but shall not be required to) cause the Company to take any one or more of the following actions:

^accelerate in whole or in part the expiration of some or all of the restrictions on any Restricted Stock Award;

^if the Restructuring is in the form of a Non-Surviving Event, cause the surviving entity to assume in whole or in part any one or more of the outstanding Awards upon such terms and provisions as the Administrator deems desirable; or

^redeem in whole or in part any one or more of the outstanding Awards (whether or not then exercisable) in consideration of a cash payment, as such payment may be reduced for tax withholding obligations in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value, determined as of the date immediately preceding the consummation of the Restructuring, of the aggregate number of Shares subject to the Award and as to which the Award is being redeemed.

The Company shall promptly notify each Participant of any election or action taken by the Company under this Section 10(d). In the event of any election or action taken by the Company pursuant to this Section 10(d) that requires the amendment or cancellation of any Award Agreement as may be specified in any notice to the Participant thereof, that Participant shall promptly deliver that Award Agreement to the Company in order for that amendment or cancellation to be implemented by the Company and the Administrator. The failure of the Participant to deliver any such Award Agreement to the Company as provided in the preceding sentence shall not in any manner affect the validity or enforceability of any action taken by the Company and the Administrator under this Section 10(d), including without limitation any redemption of an Award as of the consummation of a Restructuring. Any cash payment to be made by the Company pursuant to this Section 10(d) in connection with the redemption of any outstanding Awards shall be paid to the Participant thereof currently with the delivery to the Company of the Award Agreement evidencing that Award; **provided, however**, that any such redemption shall be effective upon the consummation of the Restructuring notwithstanding that the payment of the redemption price may occur subsequent to the consummation. If all or any portion of an outstanding Award is to be exercised or accelerated upon or after the consummation of a Restructuring that does not occur in connection with a Change in Control and is in the form of a Non-Surviving Event, and as a part of that Restructuring shares of stock, other securities, cash, or property shall be issuable or deliverable in exchange for Shares, then the Participant shall thereafter be entitled to purchase or receive (in lieu of the number of Shares that the Participant would otherwise be entitled to purchase or receive) the number of Shares, other securities, cash, or property to which such number of Shares would have been entitled in connection with the Restructuring and such Award shall be subject to adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Section 10.

^^**Notice of Restructuring**. The Company shall attempt to keep all Participants informed with respect to any Restructuring or of any potential Restructuring to the same extent that the Company’s stockholders are informed by the Company of any such event or potential event.

^**Tax Withholding**

Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant’s FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof).

^^**Withholding Arrangements**. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (d) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.

^**No Effect on Employment or Service**. Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant’s relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant’s right or the Company’s right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

^**Date of Grant**. The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.

^**Term of Plan**. Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect until the Company’s stockholder meeting in 2015, but in no event beyond [[Date 1: Date]], unless terminated earlier under Section 15of the Plan.

^**Amendment and Termination of the Plan**.

^^**Amendment and Termination**. The Administrator may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.

^^**Stockholder Approval**. The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.

^^**Effect of Amendment or Termination**. No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator’s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.

^**Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares**.  
^^**Legal Compliance**. Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

^^**Investment Representations**. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.

^**Inability to Obtain Authority**. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.

^**Stockholder Approval**. The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
