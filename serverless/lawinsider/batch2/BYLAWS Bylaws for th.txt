Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall determine to be in the best interest of the corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

^RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION. Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of Nevada as the same exist or may hereafter be amended (but in the case of such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said laws permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and amounts expended in seeking indemnification granted to such person under applicable law, this bylaw or any agreement with the corporation) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such perso n only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was initiated or authorized by one or more members of the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 78, so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not enti tled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. In no event shall anything herein contained be so construed as to permit the Board to authorize payment of, or the corporation to pay, any amounts for any purpose where the director or officer was engaged in any action or activity known to him or her while so engaged to be unlawful, nor any action or activity constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of his or her duties and obligations to the corporation and the stockholders. The rights set forth herein shall not be exclusive of other right to which any director or officer may be entitled as a matter of law. The corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

**Section** 2. **RIGHT OF CLAIMANT TO BRING SUIT.** If a claim under Section 1 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant ha s failed to meet a standard of conduct which makes it permissible under Nevada law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because he or she has met such standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has failed to meet such standard of conduct.

^NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

^INSURANCE. The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under Nevada law.

**Section** S. **EXPENSES AS A** W**ITNESS.** To the extent that any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation is by reason of such position, or a position with another entity at the request of the corporation, a witness in any action, suit or proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified against all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.

^INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS. The corporation may enter into indemnity agreements with the persons who are members of its Board of Directors from time to time, and with such officers, employees and agents as the Board may designate, such indemnity agreements to provide in substance that the corporation will indemnify such persons to the full extent contemplated by this Article.

**Section** 7. **EFFECT OF AMENDMENT.** Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VII by the stockholders and the directors of the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or other of the corporation existing at the time of the amendment, repeal or modification.

These Bylaws may be altered, amended, or repealed at any regular meeting of the stockholders (or at any special meeting thereof duly called for the purpose) by a majority vote of the shares represented and entitled to vote at such meeting; provided that in the notice of such special meeting, notice of such purpose shall be given. Subject to the laws of the State of Nevada, the Board of Directors may, by majority vote of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, amend these Bylaws, or enact such other Bylaws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation of the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation.
