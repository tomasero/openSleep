“Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment or settlement of Additional Grants, if applicable, may be accelerated as provided in **Section 1(b)(iii)(E) and (F)** below. Subject to the foregoing requirements, Additional Grants shall be made under a Plan and shall be paid at the time of settlement, to the extent earned, in either (i) fully vested, freely transferable shares of Company common stock (subject to limitations on transfer imposed under applicable law) or (ii) if insufficient shares remain under the applicable Plan at the time of settlement to pay any earned portion of an Additional Grant in shares of Company common stock, then such portion of the Additional Grant shall instead be paid in cash.

Each Additional Grant shall vest, subject to **Sections 1(b)(iii)(E) and (F)** below, on [[Date 6: Date]] of the year imm ediately following the year in which such Additional Grant is made, subject to Executive’s continued employment through such [[Date 6]], in each case, as to (i) no portion of the award if the applicable performance goals are attained at less than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of target, (ii) [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the award if the applicable performance goals are attained at [[Percentage 1]]% of target, (iii) [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the award if the applicable performance goals are attained at or above [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of target, and (iv) a linear pro ration between [[Percentage 2]]% – [[Percentage 3]]% of the award if the applicable performance goals are attained between [[Percentage 1]]% – [[Percentage 4]]% of target (for example, an Additional Grant shall vest as to [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of the award upon attainment of [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the applicable target), 

provided, that subject to each of **Sections 1(b)(iii)(E) and (F)** below, the continued service requirement applicable to the 2010 Additional Grant shall be satisfied by Executive’s continued employment through [[Date 7: Date]], but vesting of the award shall remain subject to the attainment of the applicable performance criteria during the applicable performance period (to the extent not previously attained).”
