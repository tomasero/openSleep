Bond Special Servicer shall enter into work-out agreements (the “**Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreements**”) with each of the [[Organization 22 Name]]s whose Properties are financed by those [[Organization 23 Name]] Bonds listed on Schedule B-1 (the “**Schedule B-1 Bonds**”). The Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreements shall be such agreements as contemplated by Section 5.3(d) of the Bond Reimbursement Agreement to enable the debt service coverage ratio requirements for the Properties with respect to which the Schedule B-1 Bonds have be en issued to meet the requirements for Stabilization under the Bond Reimbursement Agreement.

3.1.2 **Schedule B-1 Work-Out Sources**. The sources to enable the conditions for Stabilization to be met under the Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreements shall consist of one or more of the following (the “**Schedule B-1 Work-Out Sources**”):

^^^payments to be made by or on behalf of the respective [[Organization 22 Name]]s, including amounts guaranteed for such purpose by the Local General Partners who are not Affiliated with CCG (the “**Unaffiliated Local General Partners**”) or their respective Affiliates pursuant to guaranties to cause Stabilization to occur and to fund, among other obligations, Debt Service Shortfall Payments until Stabilization has occurred (the “**Local Partnership Guaranties**”) that are applied to either pay off that portion of the principal amount of the respective Schedule B-1 Bonds or to acquire subordinate debt;

^^^capital held by the respective [[Organization 23 Name]]s (directly or through a Middle-Tier Entity) that has not been contributed to the respective [[Organization 22 Name]]s in which they have invested by reason of Stabilization not having occurred with respect to the Property of such [[Organization 22 Name]] (the “**Unfunded Equity Payments**”) which is applied to the partial mandatory redemption of the respective Schedule B-1 Bonds (which both CFin Holdings and Natixis agree as of the date hereof may be applied for the purpose of achieving Stabilization without further approval of Natixis or CFin Holdings unless a Cash Freeze Event has occurred); or

^^^funds to be released from either (x) the Stabilization Escrow Account or (y) other adjustments to be made to the value of the B Certificates including substitutions of existing obligations under the respective Schedule B-1 Bond with subordinated debt; and, in connection therewith, the Centerline Parties hereby agree to cause the aggregate amount of (i) funds released from the Stabilization Escrow Account **plus** (ii) reductions in the then current face value of the B Certificates in the form of reductions in principal of the corresponding Schedule B-1 Bond or Schedule B-2 Bond, plus (iii) reductions in the then current value of the B Certificates in the form of reductions in the rate of interest payable on the corresponding Schedule B-1 Bond or Schedule B-2 Bond, which reductions shall be determined using the methodology used in the example in **Exhibit 3.1.2** , **minus** (iv) the aggregate value (as reasonably determined by Natixis and Centerline) of any property received by any Centerline Party or its affiliates in consideration for causing Stabilization to occur with respect to a Schedule B-1 Bond or B-2 Bond to the extent not assigned and transferred in full to CFin Holdings (such aggregate amount, the “**Series B Adjustments**”) with respect to Natixis Approved Properties to be at least Thirty Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]), but not greater than $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (the “**Centerline Stabilization Cap**”).

3.1.3 **Provisions of the Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreements**. The Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreements shall be entered into with respect to each of the Schedule B-1 Bonds, other than with respect to the [[Organization 17 Name]] and the Walton Trails Project, simultaneously with entering into this Amendment and true, correct and complete copies thereof shall be delivered to Natixis. The Centerline Parties agree to cause the transactions contemplated thereunder to be completed within nine (9) months of the Closing Date (other than with respect to the Walton Trails Project). Failure to complete such transactions, including the Stabilization of the Properties related to the Schedule B-1 Bonds, shall constitu te a Cash Freeze Event. For the purposes of this Section 3.1.3, Stabilization with respect to any Property shall not have occurred until Freddie Mac shall have delivered to the respective trustee under the bond indenture for such Stabilization Work-Out Bond a notification that Stabilization has occurred. The amount and the allocation of the respective Schedule B-1 Work-Out Sources to cause Stabilization to occur are set forth on Schedule B-1 hereto. Natixis and CFin Holdings hereby consent to the use of the Schedule B-1 Work-Out Sources as set forth in Schedule B-1, to the extent that such consent is required under the respective agreements to which it is party.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until a Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement is entered into with respect to the Walton Trail Bonds which may be entered into at the discretion of the Centerline Parties provided that the Series B Adjustments are sufficient to cause Stabilization to occur with respect to the Walton Trail Bonds and the other Schedule B-1 Bonds, the Bond Special Servicer hereby agrees with Natixis (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of the Walton Trails Local Partnership), that subject to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, for up to two years from the Closing Date but not later than the Special Servicing Crossover Date (as defined in the Serving Agreement) (the earlier to occur of (i) the date such forbearance terminates and (ii) the Special Servicing Crossover Date, the “**Forbearance Election Termination Date**”) it will not, nor will it cause Freddie Mac to, direct the trustee for the bonds issued in connection with the Walton Trails Project to foreclose thereon and further elects not to continue to make Debt Service Shortfall Payments nor cause Stabilization to occur with respect thereto (the “**Forbearance Election**”). Unless the Forbearance Election is replaced by a Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement, then all amounts that were projected to be applied to the Walton Trails Project as a Series B Adjustment which are not so applied shall be applied to cause Stabilization to occur with respect to one or more Schedule B-2 Bonds within nine months of the Forbearance Election Termination Date but in any event prior to the Required Stabilization D ate. No Series B Adjustments projected to be applied to the Walton Trails Project shall be applied unless such Series B Adjustment causes Stabilization to occur with respect to the Walton Trails Project. It shall be a condition to the consummation of each Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement that the related [[Organization 11 Name]] shall have received a Stabilization Opinion in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Natixis. It shall be a condition to the entering into of each Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement that the related Property be a Natixis Approved Property at the time that such agreement is entered into; provided that it shall not be a condition to performance or consummation of such Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement that such Property continue to be a Natixis Approved Property.

^^The Approved Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement with respect to the [[Organization 17 Name]] that is attached hereto and entitled “Agreement Relating to Stabilization and Loan Paydown” (the “**Preferred Glenbrook Work-Out Agreement**”) provides, among other things, for the provision of additional financing to the [[Organization 17 Name]], the commitment for which has not been delivered as of the date of this Agreement. The parties agree that if such commitment is issued and the provisions of the Preferred Glenbrook Work-Out Agreement are agreed to, the Centerline Parties are authorized to enter into the Preferred Glenbrook Work-Out Agreement within sixty days following the date of this Amendment (th e “**Glenbrook Execution Date**”). If the Preferred Glenbrook Work-Out Agreement is not entered into by the parties thereto on or prior to the Glenbrook Execution Date, the Centerline Parties shall remove the general partner of the [[Organization 15 Name]] and shall within thirty days of such removal enter into a Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement substantially in the form of the other Approved Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement with respect to the [[Organization 17 Name]] entitled “Bond Restructuring Agreement.” (the “**Alternative Glenbrook Work-Out Agreement**”).

^^It shall be a condition to the consummation of each Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement that the related [[Organization 11 Name]] shall have received a Stabilization Opinion in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Natixis. It shall be a condition to the entering into of each Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement that the related Property be a Natixis Approved Property at the time that such agreement is entered into; provided that it shall not be a condition to performance or consummation of such Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreement that such Property continue to be a Natixis Approved Property.

For the avoidance of doubt, CFin Holdings shall have no obligations in respect of Debt Service Shortfall Payments for any Schedule B-1 Bond.

^^**Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreements**. CCG shall cause CAHA in its capacity as Bond Special Servicer to enter into work-out agreements in (the “**Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreements**”) with each of the [[Organization 22 Name]]s whose Properties are financed by those Bonds listed on Schedule B-2 (the “**Schedule B-2 Bonds**”) which Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreements shall be entered into simultaneously with entering into this Amendment, except with respe ct to the Approved Schedule B-2 Work-Out Agreement with respect to the [[Organization 20 Name]], and shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.4 (the “Approved Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreements”). The Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreements shall be such agreements, as contemplated by Section 5.3(d) of the Bond Reimbursement Agreement, that:

^^extend the date of mandatory Stabilization for the Schedule B-2 Bonds to a date not earlier than the Required Stabilization Date, except as provided below with respect to the Mission del Rio Bonds; and

^^except as provided below with respect to the Mission del Rio Bonds, provide credit support to the [[Organization 22 Name]] for payment of (x) Debt Service Shortfall Payments with respect to the period until Stabilization occurs but not later than the Required Stabilization Date and (y) amounts required to achieve Stabilization, which credit support shall be exclusively provided in the form of a Limited Support Guaranty.

Notwithstanding that the Approved Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement with respect to the respective Schedule B-2 Bonds financing the respective Properties held by Cottonwood Hammer, LP and [[Organization 24 Name]] (the “**Provident Work-Out Agreement**”) provides for an extension of the Stabilization Date to [[Date 6: Date]] rather than the Required Stabilization Date, if Stabilization has not occurred with respect to any such Schedule B-2 Bond by [[Date 6]], then CCG shall cause the Bond Special Servicer to enter into or modify the Provident Work-Out Agreement to extend the date of mandatory Stabilization with respect to such Schedule B-2 Bonds to the Required Stabilization Date. The failure to cause such extension of the mandatory Stab ilization date to occur (a “**Provident Stabilization Extension Failure**”) shall constitute a Cash Freeze Event under the Master Agreement.

As of the date of entering into this Amendment the Mission del Rio Project has not received Form 8609s, and, accordingly, the Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement provides that the extension of the date of Stabilization to the Required Stabilization Date is subject to Form 8609s being issued for the Mission del Rio Project on or before [[Date 7: Date]]. The Approved Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement with respect to the Mission del Rio Bonds provides for a forbearance from foreclosure until [[Date 7]] and an agreement to make Debt Service Shortfall Payments until [[Date 7]], which Debt Service Shortfall Payments are guaranteed by CFin Holdings . If on or prior to [[Date 7]] Form 8609s are issued for the Mission del Rio Proj ect, the extension of the date for Stabilization shall, by the terms of such Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement, be extended to the Required Stabilization Date and the Limited Support Guaranty shall be issued by CFin Holdings.

As of the Amendment Date, the [[Organization 23 Name]]s investing in the [[Organization 18 Name]] have commenced steps to remove the present general partner of the [[Organization 18 Name]] and replace such general partner with I-70 South Service Road LLC. Accordingly, the Approved Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement with respect to the [[Organization 20 Name]] will not be entered into simultaneously with entering into this Amendment, but will be entered into by the parties thereto on or prior to [[Date 8: Date]], either upon the completion of such removal and replacement of the general partner of the [[Organization 18 Name]] or, at the election of the Centerline Parties and with notice to Natixis at least 3 Business Days prior, by the p resent general partner of the [[Organization 18 Name]], on behalf of the [[Organization 18 Name]] if such removal is not completed. The failure to cause the Approved Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement with respect to the [[Organization 20 Name]] to be executed by [[Date 8]] shall constitute a Cash Freeze Event under this Agreement.

It shall be a condition to the consummation of each Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement that the related [[Organization 11 Name]] shall have received a Stabilization Opinion in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Natixis. It shall be a condition to the entering into of each Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreement that the related Property be a Natixis Approved Property at the time that such agreement is entered into.

3.1.5 **Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements**. Each of CCG and Natixis agree that they will commence negotiations with Freddie Mac, in its capacity as majority owner of the Schedule B-2 Bonds, to obtain relief from the Stabilization requirement with respect to the all of Schedule B-2 Bonds, which relief may consist, among other possible actions, of the reduction in interest rate, provision for bifurcating debt service payments into “must-pay” and “cash flow only” obligations, acceptance of a lower debt service coverage ratio for determining whether Stabilization has been achieved and/or provision of subordinate debt, and which alternative remedies may be applied to all or any of th e Schedule B-2 Bonds (the “**Modified Stabilization Resolution**”). Upon reaching such Modified Stabilization Resolution, CCG shall cause CAHA in its capacity as Bond Special Servicer to enter into work-out agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Natixis (the “**Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements**”) with each of the [[Organization 22 Name]]s whose Properties are financed by Schedule B-2 Bonds. The Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements shall be such agreements that provide for Stabilization upon the conditions of the Modified Stabilization Resolution with respect to a particular Schedule B-2 Bond being achieved.

It shall be a condition to the consummation of each Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreement that the related [[Organization 11 Name]] shall have received a Stabilization Opinion in form and substance acceptable to Natixis. It shall be a condition to the entering into of each Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreement that the related Property be a Natixis Approved Property at the time that such agreement is entered; provided that it shall not be a condition to performance or consummation of such Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreement that such Property continue to be a Natixis Approved Property.

^^**Obligation to enter into Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements**. The Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements shall only be entered into if Natixis, CFin Holdings and CCG shall have approved of such Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Freddie Mac shall have agreed that upon the consummation of such Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements it will have determined that the conditions for satisfying Stabilization shall be deemed to have been met, and the allocation of the Schedule B-2 Work-Out Sources that shall be applied to satisfy the obligations un der such Schedule B-2 Stabilization Work-Out Agreements shall be made as CFin Holdings, CCG and Natixis shall agree.

3.1.7 The Work-Out Agreements provided with respect to one or more Schedule B-2 Bonds may provide for a Work-Out Guaranty (a “**Limited Support Guaranty**”) that provides a pledge of the Unrestricted Stabilization Sources to satisfy the obligation to cause Stabilization to occur, provided that such pledge is subordinate to the assets pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement or limits recourse to the Unrestricted Stabilization Sources. In order to provide for the allocation of the Unrestricted Stabilization Sources, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, such assets may be segregated in a separate collateral account, junior to the lien of the Credit Agreement.

^^**Conditions to Advances by CFin Holdings**. No Applications (nor any Stabilization Payment made from Unrestricted Stabilization Sources after the Required Stabilization Date) may be made by CFin Holdings unless CCG, as the managing member of CFin Holdings provides, to CFin Holdings and to Natixis (as both Administrative Agent and as Special Member of CFin Holdings) certification in the form of Exhibit 3.2 (the “**Advance Certification**”) to the Master Agreement, at least six (6) Business Days prior to making such Application or such Stabilization Payment.

With respect to any Application for which consent is required, if the Advance Certification is delivered as described in the first sentence of this Section and no objection to the advance described in such Advance Certification is received by the date that payment is to be made as set forth in the Advance Certification (provided that such date of payment is at least six (6) business days after delivery to Natixis of the Advance Certification) by CCG, such consent of Natixis shall be deemed to have been given.

^^**Overriding Limit on Use of Credit Agreement Proceeds**. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Restructuring Documents to which the parties hereto are a party, (i) proceeds of the Loans made on or about the Closing Date (whether used on the Closing Date or thereafter) will be used (x) exclusively for Debt Service Shortfall Payments on Natixis Approved Properties which loan proceeds shall be a first priority source for such Debt Service Shortfall Payments, or (y) to the extent approved by the Administrative Agent, to satisfy obligations to cause Stabilization to occur; (ii) proceeds of other Loans under the Credit Agreement will only be used for C redit Enhanced Fund Expenses (unless otherwise approved by the Lenders); (iii) no amounts on deposit in the Operating Account or the Wachovia Deposit Account or any other funds of CFin Holdings shall be used without the consent of Natixis if a Cash Freeze Event has occurred and is continuing; (iv) CFin Holdings shall not make any Application in respect of Debt Service Shortfall Payments unless the related Property is a Natixis Approved Property; and (v) any Application consisting of cash shall only be made directly to the applicable [[Organization 23 Name]] pursuant to its Master Note. In connection with the foregoing provisions of Section 3.3, CFin Holdings shall have no obligations under this Agreement to the extent such obligations would violate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3, and CFin Holdings shall not enter into any Work-Out Guaranty unless such Work-Out Guaranty gives effect to the foregoing limits and the other limitations set forth herein.

^^**Enhanced Forbearance Agreements**. Natixis hereby consents to the execution and delivery of the Enhanced Settlement Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C-1 hereto.

The Enhanced Forbearance Agreements shall provide that the Bond Special Servicer shall forbear from exercising remedies by reason of Stabilization not having occurred with respect to the Bonds issued to finance the Enhanced Projects (the “Enhanced Bonds”) until [[Date 10: Date]], in exchange for the agreement by the respective Borrowers to agree to continue to make debt service payments. Each such obligation to make debt service payments shall be secured by a guaranty by CFin Holdings (the “Enhanced Debt Service Guaranties”) to make Debt Service Shortfall Payments until [[Date 10]] provided that the maximum amount of Debt Service Shortfall Payments to be made under all of the Enhanced Debt Service Guaranties shall not exceed $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in the aggregate (the “**Enhanced Debt Service Guaranty Cap**”) and if the respective Borrower 8217;s do not have sufficient resources to make debt service payments upon the Enhanced Debt Service Guaranty Cap being exceeded, the forbearance shall continue until [[Date 10]] notwithstanding such default. Such Guaranty will be subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3.3 hereof. Debt Service Shortfall Payments made by CFin Holdings under the Enhanced Debt Service Guaranties shall first be made from Loan Proceeds. Unfunded Equity Payments with respect to the Enhanced Local Partnerships may only be applied to cause Stabilization to occur with respect to the Enhanced Local Partnerships relating to Natixis Approved Properties. provided that the Centerline Parties shall only be permitted to apply any Unfunded Equity Payments relating to any Enhanced Local Partnership to another Enhanced Local Partnership if such application would cause Stabilization to occur with respect to each Enhanced Local Partnership with respect to which any such Unfun ded Equity has been applied or if Natixis shall have consented to such application.

^^**Unfunded**Equity**Payments**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement& #160;to the contrary, the Centerline Parties shall be permitted to apply any Unfunded Equity Payments relating to any [[Organization 22 Name]] (the “Subject Partnership”) to another [[Organization 22 Name]] if (i) such application of Unfunded Equity Payments do not contravene the documents governing the useof the Unfunded Equity Payments or fiduciary duties owed with respect to such Unfunded Equity Payments and (ii) such Subject Partnership shall have failed to earn the right to the payment of such Unfunded Equity Payment.

^**Representations and Warranties**. Each of the Centerline Parties represents and warrants to Natixis that (i) each of the representations and warranties in Section 7.1 of the Master Agreement is true and correct as of the date hereof, (ii) each Stabilization Work-Out Property and each Enhanced Project is, as of the date hereof, a Natixis Approved Property and (iii) Annex A hereto sets for a true, correct and complete list of all Unfunded Equity Payments held at each of the [[Organization 23 Name]]s.

Natixis consents to and approves the execution and delivery (x) of each of the Approved Schedule B-1 Work-Out Agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.1 hereto, (y) of the Approved Schedule B-2 Preliminary Work-Out Agreements, including in connection therewith the Limited Support Guaranty each in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.4 and Exhibit B-4, respectively, and (z) the Enhanced Settlement Agreement in the form of Exhibit C-1 and the Enhanced Forbearance Agreements in the form of Exhibit C-2.
