\centered **2010 Restricted Stock Implementation for Non-Employee Directors** 

^*Purpose of the Restricted Stock Implementation.* This 2010 Restricted Stock Implementation for Non-Employee Directors (the “Implementation”) of [[Organization 1 Name]] Incorporated (the “Company”) is being adopted pursuant to the Company’s 2007 Employees Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”).

Under the Plan, non-employee directors are “Eligible Persons” who may be designated by the Compensation Committee to receive Awards.
