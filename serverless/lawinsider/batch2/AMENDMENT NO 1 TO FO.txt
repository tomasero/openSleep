^such Installment Sales Receivables do not arise from sales on consignment, guaranteed sale, sale and return, sale on approval, or other terms under which payment by the Account Debtor may be conditional or contingent (other than pursuant to the right of return given to customers in the ordinary course of business consistent with the practices of Borrower as of the date of such sale);
