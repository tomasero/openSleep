^^^^^ 
specify to each Noteholder, so long as such Place of Payment shall be either the principal office of the Company or the principal office of a bank or trust company in New York, New York. 

^^So long as any Initial Noteholder or its nominee shall be a Noteholder, and notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture, Section 2.02(a) or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose below such Initial Noteholder’s name in Schedule A to the Note Agreement, or by such other method or at such other address as such Initial Noteholder shall have from time to time specified to the Company and the Trustee in writing for such purpose in accordance with the Note Agreement, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or redemption in full of any Note, such Initial Noteholder shall surrender such Note for cancellation to the Company at its principal office or at the Place of Payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 2.02(a). Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by such Initial Noteholder or its nominee such Initial Noteholder will, at its election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 305 of the Indenture; provided, that a transfer by endorsement shall not constitute a registration of transfer for purposes of the Indenture and the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee shall be entitled to the protections of Section 308 of the Indenture with respect to any Note, the transfer of which has not been so registered. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 2.02(b) to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by such Initial Noteholder under the Indenture. The Company agrees and acknowledges that the Trustee shall not be liable for any Noteholder’s failure to perform its obligations under this Section 2.02(b).

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 113 of the Mortgage Indenture, if the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date of the Notes shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Mortgage Indenture or this Fifth Supplemental Indenture) payment of interest on or principal (and premium, if any) of the Notes due at the Stated Maturity or on any Redemption Date thereof need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Stated Maturity or on any Redemption Date thereof, provided that interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the Notes due at the Stated Maturity or on any Redemption Date thereof at the rate set forth in the Notes until the date of actual payment. 

^^^^^ 
^Mandatory Redemption of the Notes. 

In addition to the mandatory redemption required by Section 501(a) of the Mortgage Indenture, which Section 501(a) shall apply to the Notes, in the event that any one or more Dispositions during any consecutive 12 month period (except Dispositions permitted under Section 3.02(b)(i) or (ii)) yield Net Proceeds in excess of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] in the aggregate, the Net Proceeds of such Disposition or Dispositions shall be used for the mandatory redemption of the Notes, and/or the redemption or prepayment of other Senior Secured Debt in accordance with its terms, on a date which is no more than nine months following a Disposition that, when aggregated with any other Dispositions, requires compliance with this Section 2.03 unless (x) during the nine month period immediately preceding the date of such Disposition, the Company Invested in any Rate Base Assets in which case an amount of such Net Proceeds equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the total aggregate amount of all such Investments made during such preceding nine month period (excluding, however, the amount of any Investments made pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of “Investment” that were not expended for Rate Base Assets during such nine month period) over (B) the aggregate amount of Debt incurred by the Company (which, with respect to any Debt incurred under any permitted credit facility of a revolving nature, shall be calculated on a net basis after taking into account any borrowings, prepayments, repayments, reborrowings or other extensions of credit made by or in favor of the Company thereunder), in each case, during such preceding nine month period, need not be applied to such redemption or prepayment, as the case may be, or (y) during the nine month period following the date of such Disposition, the Company shall Invest in Rate Base Assets, in which case an amount of such Net Proceeds so Invested during such following nine month period need not be applied to such redemption or prepayment, as the case may be; *provided, however*, that in the event that any such amounts referred to in this clause (y) Invested pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of “Investment” are not expended for Rate Base Assets within a period of six months from the end of such following nine month period, any such amounts not so expended shall be used for the mandatory redemption of the Notes, and/or the redemption or prepayment of other Senior Secured Debt in accordance with its terms, on a date not later than the last day of such six month period. Any redemption of the Notes pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be made (i) at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and shall be accompanied by payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed to the redemption date and a Make-Whole Amount and (ii) in accordance with the procedures for optional redemption set forth in Section 2.04(b) below. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.03, any amounts utilized pursuant to clauses (x) or (y) above to reduce the amount of Net Proceeds required to be applied to redemption of the Notes and/or redemption or prepayment of other Senior Secured Debt in accordance with its terms may be utilized no more than once with respect to the Net Proceeds of any one or more Dispositions occurring in any consecutive twelve month period. 

^Optional Redemption.  

^^Pursuant to Section 501(b) of the Mortgage Indenture, the Notes may be redeemed at the option of Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of such Notes plus the Make-Whole Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date; *provided, however,* that if the Notes 

^^^^^ 
are redeemed in part, the Notes shall not be redeemed in an amount less than $[[USD Value 2]] of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article Five of the Mortgage Indenture, the redemption of the Notes shall take place in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in this Section 2.04(b), without prejudice to the requirements of Section 502 (which shall for purposes of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture also be applicable to a redemption under Section 2.03) and Sections 505 through 507 of the Mortgage Indenture. The Company (or the Trustee, if so requested pursuant to Section 504 of the Mortgage Indenture) shall give each Noteholder written notice of each optional redemption under this Section 2.04, or a mandatory redemption under Section 2.03, as the case may be, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption. Each such notice shall specify such date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such Noteholder to be redeemed (determined in accordance with Section 2.04(c)) and the interest to be paid on the redemption date with respect to such principal amount being redeemed, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such redemption (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the redemption), setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business Days prior to such redemption, the Company shall deliver to each Noteholder and the Trustee a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified redemption date. The Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. 

^^Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article Five of the Mortgage Indenture, in the case of each partial redemption of the Notes pursuant to Section 2.04(b), the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed shall be allocated by the Trustee among all of the Notes at the time Outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofor called for redemption. 

^Purchase of Notes.  

Except as may be agreed to by a Noteholder or Noteholders in connection with an offer made to all Noteholders on the same terms and conditions, the Company shall not and shall not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the Outstanding Notes except upon the payment or redemption of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Company will promptly cause the Trustee to cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, redemption or purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of the Indenture and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes. 

^Payment upon Event of Default. 

Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under Section 802 of the Indenture, whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (including, without limitation, interest accrued thereon at the applicable rate for overdue payments) and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent 

^^^^^ 
permitted by applicable Law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company acknowledges that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes have become due and payable under Section 802 of the Indenture, whether automatically or by declaration, as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances. 

^Transfers.  

In registering the transfer of any Note in accordance with Section 305 of the Mortgage Indenture, the Security Registrar and the Trustee shall have no responsibility to monitor securities law compliance in connection with any such transfer.

Exhibit A  

\centered DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES 

The following properties of the Company, owned as of the date hereof, have been acquired by the Company subsequent to the date of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture: 

\centered See Attached. 

^^^^^ 
Exhibit B  

\centered SUBORDINATION TERMS 

The unsecured permitted indebtedness evidenced by this instrument is subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt Obligations (as hereinafter defined) of [[Company]], a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Michigan (the “Company”). Each holder of this instrument, by its acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by all the provisions hereof. 

All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of [[Date 1]] (as in effect on the date hereof, the “Supplemental Indenture”), between the Company and [[Organization 1 Name]], N.A. (as successor to [[Organization 2 Name]]), as trustee (the “Trustee”). 

The term “Senior Debt Obligations”, as used herein, shall include all, loans, advances, debts, liabilities and obligations, howsoever arising (whether or not evidenced by any note or instrument and whether or not for the payment of money), direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising (collectively, as used herein, “Obligations”) of the Company now or hereafter existing in respect of Senior Debt (as defined herein) and any amendments, modifications, deferrals, renewals or extensions of any such Senior Debt, or of any notes or evidences of indebtedness heretofore or hereafter issued in evidence of or in exchange for any such Obligation, whether for principal, interest (including interest payable in respect of any such Obligations subsequent to the commencement of any proceeding against or with respect to the Company under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 *et seq.* (the “Bankruptcy Code”), or any provision of corresponding bankruptcy, insolvency or commercial reorganization legislation of any other jurisdiction, whether or not such interest is an allowed claim enforceable against the debtor, and whether or not the holder of such obligation would be otherwise entitled to receive dividends or payments with respect to any such interest or any such proceeding), premium (including Make-Whole Amount), if any, fees, expenses or otherwise. 

The term “Senior Debt”, as used herein, shall mean (i) all Senior Secured Debt and (ii) all unsecured Debt of the Company permitted to be incurred by the Company pursuant to the Mortgage Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture which is not subject to any subordination terms whether or not similar to those set forth in this instrument. 

The term “Subordinated Debt”, as used herein, shall mean all Obligations of the Company evidenced by this instrument owing to any Person now or hereafter existing hereunder (whether created directly or acquired by assignment or otherwise), whether for principal, interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any bankruptcy proceeding described in the definition of Senior Debt Obligations, whether or not such interest accrues after the filing of such petition for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code or is an allowed claim in such proceeding), fees, expenses or otherwise. 

^^^^^ 
On and after the Closing Date, no payment on account of principal, interest, fees, premium, expenses or otherwise on this Subordinated Debt shall be made by the Company in cash or otherwise unless (a) full payment of all amounts then due and payable on all Senior Debt Obligations has been made, (b) such payment would be permitted by the Indenture and any Senior Debt Document (as defined below) and (c) immediately after giving effect to such payment, there shall not exist any Default or Event of Default. Any such payment permitted pursuant to this paragraph is hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Payment”. For the purposes of these provisions, no Senior Debt Obligations shall be deemed to have been paid in full until the obligee of such Senior Debt Obligations shall have received payment in full in cash. 

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding up or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, then and in any such event all principal, premium and interest and all other amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Debt Obligations shall first be paid in full before the holders of the Subordinated Debt shall be entitled to retain any assets so paid or distributed in respect of the Subordinated Debt (whether for principal, premium, interest or otherwise), and upon any such dissolution or winding up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the holders of the Subordinated Debt would be entitled, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be paid *pro rata* among the holders of Senior Debt Obligations by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the holders of the Subordinated Debt if received by them. So long as any Senior Debt Obligations are outstanding, the holder of this instrument shall not commence, or join with any creditor other than the Trustee or the Senior Debt Parties (as hereinafter defined) in commencing, or directly or indirectly causing the Company to commence, or assist the Company in commencing, any proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence. 

The holder of this instrument hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers (without imposing any obligation on) each Person (each such Person a “Senior Debt Party” and collectively, the “Senior Debt Parties”) that has entered into an agreement, instrument, or other document evidencing or relating to any Senior Debt Obligation (each such agreement, instrument or other document, a “Senior Debt Document”) as a lender or creditor and such Senior Debt Party’s representatives, under the circumstances set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every such payment or distribution described therein and give acquittance therefor, to file claims and proofs of claims in any statutory or nonstatutory proceeding, to vote such Senior Debt Party’s ratable share of the full amount of the Subordinated Debt evidenced by this instrument in its sole discretion in connection with any resolution, arrangement, plan of reorganization, compromise, settlement or extension and to take all such other action (including, without limitation, the right to participate in any composition of creditors and the right to vote such Senior Debt Party’s ratable share of the full amount of the Subordinated Debt at creditors’ meetings for the election of trustees, acceptances of plans and otherwise), in the name of the holder of the Subordinated Debt evidenced by this instrument or otherwise, as such Senior Debt Party’s representatives may deem necessary or desirable for the enforcement of the subordination provisions of this instrument. The holder of this instrument shall execute and deliver to each Senior Debt Party and such holder’s representatives all such

further instruments confirming the foregoing authorization, and all such powers of attorney, proofs of claim, assignments of claim and other instruments, and shall take all such other action as may be reasonably requested by such holder or such holder’s representatives in order to enable such holder to enforce all claims upon or in respect of such holder’s ratable share of the Subordinated Debt evidenced by this instrument. 

The holder of this instrument shall not, without the prior written consent of the Senior Debt Parties, have any right to accelerate payment of, or institute any proceeding to enforce, the Subordinated Debt so long as any Senior Debt Obligations are outstanding, unless and until all Senior Debt Parties have accelerated payment thereof and commenced proceedings to enforce such Senior Debt Obligations. 

After the payment in full of all amounts due in respect of Senior Debt Obligations, the holder or holders of the Subordinated Debt shall be subrogated to the rights of the Senior Debt Parties to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to Senior Debt Obligations until the principal of, premium on, interest on and all other amounts due or to become due with respect to the Subordinated Debt shall be paid in full subject to the terms and conditions of the Subordinated Debt or of any agreement among the holders of the Subordinated Debt and other Subordinated Debt of the Company. 

If any payment (other than a Permitted Payment) or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by the holder of the Subordinated Debt in such capacity before all Senior Debt Obligations are paid in full, such payment or distribution will be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be immediately paid over *pro rata* among the Senior Debt Parties, for application to the payment in full of Senior Debt Obligations, until all Senior Debt Obligations shall have been paid in full. 

Nothing contained in this instrument is intended to or shall impair as between the Company, its creditors (other than the Senior Debt Parties) and the holders of the Subordinated Debt, the obligations of the Company to pay to the holders of the Subordinated Debt, as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or to affect the relative rights of the holders of the Subordinated Debt and creditors of the Company (other than the Senior Debt Parties). 

The Senior Debt Parties shall not be prejudiced in their rights to enforce the subordination contained herein in accordance with the terms hereof by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company. 

The holder of this instrument agrees to execute and deliver such further documents and to do such other acts and things as the Senior Debt Parties may reasonably request in order fully to effect the purposes of these subordination provisions. Each holder of this instrument by its acceptance hereof authorizes and directs the trustee or other representative, if any, of the Subordinated Debt represented by this instrument on its behalf to take such further action as may be necessary to effectuate the subordination as provided herein and appoints such trustee or other representative, if any, as its attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. 

^^^^^ 
The subordination effected by these provisions, and the rights of the Senior Debt Parties, shall not be affected by (i) any amendment of, or addition or supplement to, the Financing Agreements, any other Senior Debt Document, or any other document evidencing or securing Senior Debt Obligations, (ii) any exercise or non-exercise of any right, power or remedy under or in respect to the Financing Agreements, any other Senior Debt Document, or any other document evidencing or securing Senior Debt Obligations or (iii) any waiver, consent, release, indulgence, extension, renewal, modification, delay, or other action, inaction or omission, in respect of the Financing Agreements, any other Senior Debt Document, or any other document evidencing or securing Senior Debt Obligations; whether or not any holder of any Subordinated Debt shall have had notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing. 

No failure on the part of any Senior Debt Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor all any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by Law. 

The holder of this instrument and the Company each hereby waive promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Senior Debt Obligations and these terms of subordination and any requirement that the Trustee or any Senior Debt Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to take any action against the Company or any other Person or any Mortgaged Property. 

These terms of subordination shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Senior Debt Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Trustee or any Senior Debt Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 

The provisions of these terms of subordination constitute a continuing agreement and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full of the Senior Debt Obligations and the termination or expiration of all obligations to extend credit under the Senior Debt Documents, (ii) be binding upon the holder of this instrument, the Company and its successors, transferees and assignees and (iii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Trustee and each Senior Debt Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), each Senior Debt Party may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under all or any of the Senior Debt Documents to any other Person (to the extent permitted by the Senior Debt Documents), and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the rights in respect thereof granted to such Senior Debt Party herein or otherwise. 

This instrument shall be governed by and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
