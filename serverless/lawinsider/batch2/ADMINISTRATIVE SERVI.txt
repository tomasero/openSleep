**WHEREAS,** [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and [[Organization 1 Name]] contemplate that such an agreement for services will achieve certain operating economies and provide economic and other benefits to each of them; and

**WHEREAS,** [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and [[Organization 1 Name]] wish to assure that all charges for services and the use of equipment incurred hereunder are reasonable and are based on actual costs arrived at in a fair and equitable manner, and that estimated costs, whenever used, are adjusted periodically to bring them into alignment with actual costs;

**NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the premises and of the mutual promises set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and [[Organization 1 Name]] agree as follows:

^**PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES AND USE OF FACILITIES****.** Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this Agreement, [[Organization 1 Name]] agrees to the extent requested by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) to perform diligently and in a professional manner such services as set forth in this Agreement as [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) determines to be reasonably necessary in the conduct of its operations. In addition, [[Organization 1 Name]] agrees at all times to maintain sufficient trained personnel of the kind necessary to perform under this Agreement.

^^**CAPACITY OF PERSONNEL AND STATUS OF FACILITIES****.** Whenever [[Organization 1 Name]] utilizes its personnel to perform services for [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) pursuant to this Agreement, such personnel shall at all times remain employees of [[Organization 1 Name]] subject solely to its direction and control, and [[Organization 1 Name]] shall alone retain full liability to such employees for their welfare, salaries, fringe benefits, legally required employer contributions, and tax obligations.

^^**EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT IN RENDERING SERVICES****.** In providing any services hereunder which require the exercise of judgment by [[Organization 1 Name]], [[Organization 1 Name]] shall perform any such service in accordance with any standards and guidelines that [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) develops and communicates to [[Organization 1 Name]]. In performing any services hereunder, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall at all times act in a manner reasonably calculated to be in or not opposed to the best interests of [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

^^**CONTROL****.** The performance of services by [[Organization 1 Name]] for [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) pursuant to this Agreement shall in no way impair the absolute control of the business and operations of [[Organization 1 Name]] or [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) by their respective Boards of Directors. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall act hereunder so as to assure the separate operating identity of [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

^**SERVICES****.** The performance of [[Organization 1 Name]] under this Agreement with respect to the business and operation of [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) shall at all times be subject to the direction and control of the Board of Directors of [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

Subject to the foregoing and to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this Agreement, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall provide to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.), at [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.)’s request, human resources services including, but not limited to, the following: recruiting and maintaining appropriately trained and qualified personnel and equipment necessary for the performance of actuarial, financial, legal, administrative, and other operational support functions related to the maintenance and operation of insurance companies and business enterprises such as [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and its affiliates; payroll processing; employee benefit plan design and administration; compensation design and administration; and employee relations.

^**CHARGES AND PAYMENT****.** [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) agrees to reimburse [[Organization 1 Name]] for the cost of the services provided by [[Organization 1 Name]] to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) pursuant to this Agreement. The charge to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) for such services shall include all direct and directly allocable expenses, reasonably and equitably determined to be attributable to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) by [[Organization 1 Name]], plus a reasonable charge for direct overhead, the amount of such charge for overhead to be agreed upon by the parties from time to time. The allocable expenses and overhead charges shall include, without limitation: salaries; payroll taxes for

personnel performing services; expenses associated with offering employee benefit plans to personnel performing services, including periodic benefit plan contributions; license and registration fees; equipment and supplies; computer charges; consulting; accounting and legal fees; travel expenses; and all other charges, costs and expenses reasonably incurred in providing the services contemplated hereunder. The total fee shall consist of: (a) the reimbursement and charge for overhead, as described above (“Cost”), plus (b) only with respect to those services that are not “covered services” as defined in IRS Revenue Procedure 2007-13, a profit margin to be agreed upon by the parties from time to time, not to exceed fifteen percent of Cost (the “Profit Margin”). The Profit Margin shall be based upon market conditions, including rates charged in similar transactions between unrelated parties, in order to ensure an arm’s length standard, and any changes to the Profit Margin shall be agreed upon by the parties prior to services being rendered at the new Profit Margin.

On the Friday before each bi-weekly payroll date, [[Organization 1 Name]] will present a detailed written estimate of charges due hereunder for the prior two-week pay period to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.), and any charges estimated for the prior two-week pay period shall be paid by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) no later than the Tuesday following receipt of the written estimate. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, [[Organization 1 Name]] will present a detailed written statement (the “Monthly True-Up Statement”) to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) that reconciles any differences between the bi-weekly estimates and actual expenses for that month. Each Monthly True-Up Statement shall include charges not included in any previous Monthly True-Up Statement, and any balance payable or to be refunded as shown in the Monthly True-Up Statement shall be paid or refunded within the later of thirty (30) days following the end of the month to which the Monthly True-Up Statement applies or fifteen (15) days following receipt of the Monthly True-Up Statement by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

If [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) objects to the determination of charges in any Monthly True-Up Statement, it shall so advise [[Organization 1 Name]] within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of said determination. Unless the parties can reconcile any such objection, they shall agree to the selection of a firm of independent certified public accountants which shall determine the charges properly allocable to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and shall, within a reasonable time, submit such determination, together with the basis therefore, in writing to [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.), whereupon such determination shall be binding. The expenses of such a determination by a firm of independent certified public accountants shall be borne equally by [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

^**STANDARD OF CARE****.** The parties shall use that degree of ordinary care and reasonable diligence in the performance of services hereunder that an experienced and qualified provider of similar services under a similar services agreement would use acting in like circumstances and familiar with such matters and in accordance with such additional standards as may be adopted by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) from time to time and communicated to [[Organization 1 Name]], including industry standards and applicable laws and any contractual obligations or limitations binding on [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and made known to [[Organization 1 Name]]. Furthermore, the parties agree to maintain backup systems and contingency plans to assure that work stoppages, fires, riots, equipment, utility or transmission failures, shortage or damage, acts of God, or other similar occurrences do not jeopardize the integrity of the data maintained on behalf of the other party. Each party warrants it will maintain such systems in conformity with corporate and prudent business standards.

^**ACCOUNTING RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS****.** [[Organization 1 Name]] shall be responsible for maintaining full and accurate accounts and records of all services

rendered pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and such additional information as [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) may reasonably request for purposes of its internal bookkeeping and accounting operations. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall keep copies of such accounts and records available at its principal offices for audit, inspection, and copying by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and persons authorized by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) or any governmental agency having jurisdiction over [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) during all reasonable business hours. Such accounts and records shall be delivered upon a request for such accounts and records by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) or by any governmental agency having jurisdiction over [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

^**RECORDS AND AUDIT RIGHTS****.** All books, records, and files established and maintained by [[Organization 1 Name]] by reason of its performance under this Agreement which, absent this Agreement, would have been held by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.), shall be: (i) deemed the property of [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.); (ii) maintained in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and (iii) subject to examination at all times by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and persons authorized by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) or any governmental agency having jurisdiction over [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.).

With respect to documents which would otherwise be held by [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) and which may be created or obtained by [[Organization 1 Name]] in performing under this Agreement, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall deliver such documents to [[Organization 1 Name]] (U.S.) within thirty (30) days of their receipt or creation by [[Organization 1 Name]] except where continued custody of such original documents is necessary to perform hereunder.
