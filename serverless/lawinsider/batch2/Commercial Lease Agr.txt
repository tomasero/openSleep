If the Leased Premises or any part thereof or any appurtenance thereto is so damaged by fire, casualty or structural defects, such damage or defects not being the result of any act of negligence by Tenant or by any of Tenant's agents, employees or invitees, that the same cannot be used for Tenant's purposes, then Tenant shall have the right within ninety (90) days following damage to elect by notice to Landlord to terminate this Lease as of the date of such damage.

Rentals and other charges paid in advance for any such periods shall be credited on the next ensuing payments, if any, but if no further payments are to be made, any such advance payments shall be refunded to Tenant. The provisions of this paragraph extend not only to the matters aforesaid, but also to any occurrence which is beyond Tenant's reasonable control and which renders the Leased Premises, or any appurtenance thereto, inoperable or unfit for occupancy or use, in whole or in part, for Tenant's purposes.

**Default.**  
In the event of a default made by Tenant in the payment of rent when due to Landlord, Tenant shall have fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice thereof to cure such default. In the event of a default made by Tenant in any of the other covenants or conditions to be kept, observed and performed by Tenant, Tenant shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof to cure such default. In the event that the Tenant shall fail to cure any default within the time allowed under this paragraph, Landlord may declare the term of this Lease ended and terminated by giving Tenant written notice of such intention, and if possession of the Leased Premises is not surrendered, Landlord may reenter said premises. Landlord shall have, in addition to the remedy above provided, any other right or remedy available to Landlord on account of any Tenant default, either in law or equity. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages.

**Quiet Possession.**  
Landlord covenants and warrants that upon performance by Tenant of its obligations hereunder, Landlord will keep and maintain Tenant in exclusive, quiet, peaceable and undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the Leased Premises during the term of this Lease.

**Condemnation.**  
If any legally, constituted authority condemns the Building or such part thereof which shall make the Leased Premises unsuitable for leasing, this Lease shall cease when the public authority takes possession, and Landlord and Tenant shall account for rental as of that date. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of either party to recover compensation from the condemning authority for any loss or damage caused by the condemnation. Neither party shall have any rights in or to any award made to the other by the condemning authority.

**Subordination.**  
Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage, deed of trust or other lien presently existing or hereafter arising upon the Leased Premises, or upon the Building and to any renewals, refinancing and extensions thereof, but Tenant agrees that any such mortgagee shall have the right at any time to subordinate such mortgage, deed of trust or other lien to this Lease on such terms and subject to such conditions as such mortgagee may deem appropriate in its discretion. Landlord is hereby irrevocably vested with full power and authority to subordinate this Lease to any mortgage, deed of trust or other lien now existing or hereafter placed upon the Leased Premises of the Building. Tenant agrees that it will from time to time upon request by Landlord execute and deliver to such persons as Landlord shall request a statement in recordable form certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that the same is in full force and effect as so modified), stating the dates to which rent and other charges payable under this Lease have been paid, stating that Landlord is not in default hereunder (or if Tenant alleges a default stating the nature of such alleged default) and further stating such other matters as Landlord shall reasonably require.

**Security Deposit.**  
Landlord shall hold the Security Deposit without liability for interest and as security for the performance by Tenant of Tenant's covenants and obligations under this Lease, it being expressly understood that Tenant shall not consider the Security Deposit an advance payment of rent or a measure of Landlord's damages in case of default. Unless otherwise provided by law or regulation, Landlord may commingle the Security Deposit with Landlord's other funds. Landlord may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy, use the Security Deposit to the extent necessary to make good any arrearages of rent or to satisfy any other covenant or obligation of Tenant hereunder. Following any such application of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount so applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. If Tenant is not in default at the termination of this Lease, Landlord shall return the balance of the Security Deposit remaining after any such application to Tenant.

**Brokers.**  
Tenant represents that Tenant was not shown the Premises by any real estate broker or agent and that Tenant has not otherwise engaged in, any activity which could form the basis for a claim for real estate commission, brokerage fee, finder's fee or other similar charge, in connection with this Lease.

**Waiver.**  
No waiver of any default of Landlord or Tenant hereunder shall be implied from any omission to take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect any default other than the default specified in the express waiver and that only for the time and to the extent therein stated. One or more waivers by Landlord or Tenant shall not be construed as a waiver of a subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition.

**Memorandum of Lease.**  
The parties hereto contemplate that this Lease should not and shall not be filed for record, but in lieu thereof, at the request of either party, Landlord and Tenant shall execute a Memorandum of Lease to be recorded for the purpose of giving record notice of the appropriate provisions of this Lease.

**Headings.**  
The headings used in this Lease are for convenience of the parties only and shall not be considered in interpreting the meaning of any provision of this Lease.

**Successors.**  
The provisions of this Lease shall extend to and be binding upon Landlord and Tenant and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns.

**Consent.**  
Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent with respect to any matter for which Landlord's consent is required or desirable under this Lease.

**Performance.**  
If there is a default with respect to any of Landlord's covenants, warranties or representations under this Lease, and if the default continues more than fifteen (15) days after notice in writing from Tenant to Landlord specifying the default, Tenant may, at its option and without affecting any other remedy hereunder, cure such default and deduct the cost thereof from the next accruing installment or installments of rent payable hereunder until Tenant shall have been fully reimbursed for such expenditures, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the lesser of 5 percent (%) per annum or the then highest lawful rate. If this Lease terminates prior to Tenant's receiving full reimbursement, Landlord shall pay the un-reimbursed balance plus accrued interest to Tenant on demand.

**Compliance with Law.**  
Tenant and Landlord each shall comply with all laws, orders, ordinances and other public requirements now or hereafter affecting the Leased Premises.

**Final Agreement.**  
This Agreement terminates and supersedes all prior understandings or agreements on the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be modified only by a further writing that is duly executed by both parties.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Lease as of the day and year first above written.
