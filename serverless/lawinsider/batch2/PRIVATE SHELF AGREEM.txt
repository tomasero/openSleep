As of [[Date 1]]

[[Organization 2 Name]] (“**Prudential”**)

Each Prudential Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) which becomes bound by certain provisions of this Agreement as hereinafter provided

c/o [[Organization 3 Name]] Two Prudential Plaza, Suite 5600 Chicago, Illinois 60601

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, [[Organization 1 Name]], a Delaware corporation (herein called the “**Company”**), hereby agrees with you as set forth below. Reference is made to paragraph 10 hereof for definitions of capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein.

1.**AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE OF SHELF NOTES.** The Company will authorize the issue of its senior promissory notes (the “**Shelf Notes”**) in the aggregate principal amount of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] to be dated the date of issue thereof, to mature, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no less than 6 years and no more than 10 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in the Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to such Shelf Note delivered pursuant to paragraph 2E, and to be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto. The terms “**Shelf Note”, “Note”**, “**Shelf Notes”** and **“Notes”** as used herein shall include each Shelf Note delivered pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and each Shelf Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such Shelf Note pursuant to any such provision. Notes which have (i) the same final maturity, (ii) the same principal prepayment dates, (iii) the same principal prepayment amounts (as a percentage of the original principal amount of each Note), (iv) the same interest rate, (v) the same interest payment periods and (vi) the same date of issuance (which, in the case of a Note issued in exchange for another Note, shall be deemed for these purposes the date on which such Note’s ultimate predecessor Note was issued), are herein called a “**Series”** of Notes.

2.**PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHELF NOTES.**

**2A.**Facility.** Prudential is willing to consider, in its sole discretion and within limits which may be authorized for purchase by Prudential Affiliates from time to time, the purchase of Shelf Notes pursuant to this Agreement. The willingness of Prudential to consider such purchase of Shelf Notes is herein called the “**Facility”**. At any time, the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes stated in paragraph 1, minus the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes purchased and sold pursuant to this Agreement prior to such time, minus the aggregate principal amount of Accepted Notes (as hereinafter defined) which have not yet been purchased and sold hereunder prior to such time, is herein called the “**Available Facility Amount”** at such time. NOTWITHSTANDING THE WILLINGNESS OF PRUDENTIAL TO CONSIDER PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES BY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATES, THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO ON THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT NEITHER PRUDENTIAL NOR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCEPT OFFERS TO PURCHASE SHELF NOTES, OR TO QUOTE RATES, SPREADS OR OTHER TERMS WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES, AND THE FACILITY SHALL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY PRUDENTIAL OR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE.**

**2B.**Issuance Period.** Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement (or if the date of such anniversary is not a Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such anniversary), (ii) the 30th day after Prudential shall have given to the Company, or the Company shall have given to Prudential, a written notice stating that it elects to terminate the issuance and sale of Shelf Notes pursuant to this Agreement (or if such 30th day is not a Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such 30th day), (iii) the last Closing Day after which there is no Available Facility Amount, (iv) the termination of the Facility under paragraph 7A of this Agreement, and (v) the acceleration of any Note under paragraph 7A of this Agreement. The period during which Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement is herein called the “Issuance Period”**.

**2C.**Request for Purchase.** The Company may from time to time during the Issuance Period make requests for purchases of Shelf Notes (each such request being herein called a “Request for Purchase”**). Each Request for Purchase shall be made to Prudential by electronic mail (email), facsimile transmission or overnight delivery service, and shall (i) specify the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes covered thereby, which shall not be less than $[[USD Value 3: Number]] and not be greater than the Available Facility Amount at the time such Request for Purchase is made, (ii) specify the principal amounts, final maturities (which shall be no more than 12 years from the date of issuance), average life (which shall be no less than 6 years and no more than 10 years from the date of issuance), principal prepayment dates (if any) and amounts and interest payment periods (quarterly or semi-annually in arrears) of the Shelf Notes covered thereby, (iii) specify the use of proceeds of such Shelf Notes, (iv) specify the proposed day for the closing of the purchase and sale of such Shelf Notes, which shall be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than 10 days and not more than 25 days after the making of such Request for Purchase, (v) specify the number of the account and the name and address of the depository institution to which the purchase prices of such Shelf Notes are to be transferred on the Closing Day for such purchase and sale, (vi) certify that the representations and warranties contained in paragraph 8 are true on and as of the date of such Request for Purchase and that there exists on the date of such Request for Purchase no Event of Default or Default, and (vii) be substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto. Each Request for Purchase shall be in writing and shall be deemed made when received by Prudential.

**2D.****Rate Quotes.** Not later than five Business Days after the Company shall have given Prudential a Request for Purchase pursuant to paragraph 2C, Prudential shall either (i) provide to the Company by telephone, electronic mail (email) or facsimile transmission, in each case between 9:30 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. New York City local time (or such later time as Prudential may elect) interest rate quotes for the several principal amounts, maturities, principal prepayment schedules and interest payment periods of Shelf Notes specified in such Request for Purchase. Each quote shall represent the interest rate per annum payable on the outstanding principal balance of such Shelf Notes at which a Prudential Affiliate or Affiliates would be willing to purchase such Shelf Notes at [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the principal amount thereof or (ii) inform the Company that it will not be providing such interest rate quotes.

**2E.**Acceptance.** Within the Acceptance Window with respect to any interest rate quotes provided pursuant to paragraph 2D, the Company may, subject to paragraph 2F, elect to accept such interest rate quotes as to not less than $[[USD Value 4: Number]] aggregate principal amount of the Shelf Notes specified in the related Request for Purchase. Such election shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Company notifying Prudential by telephone or facsimile transmission within the Acceptance Window that the Company elects to accept such interest rate quotes, specifying the Shelf Notes (each such Shelf Note being herein called an “**Accepted Note”**) as to which such acceptance (herein called an “**Acceptance”**) relates. The day the Company notifies Prudential of an Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes is herein called the “**Acceptance Day”** for such Accepted Notes. Any interest rate quotes as to which Prudential does not receive an Acceptance within the Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes. Subject to paragraph 2F and the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company agrees to sell to a Prudential Affiliate or Affiliates, and Prudential agrees to cause the purchase by a Prudential Affiliate or Affiliates of, the Accepted Notes at [[Percentage 1]]% of the principal amount of such Notes. As soon as practicable following the Acceptance Day, the Company and each Prudential Affiliate which is to purchase any such Accepted Notes will execute a confirmation of such Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (herein called a “Confirmation of Acceptance”**). If the Company should fail to execute and return to Prudential within three Business Days following the Company’s receipt thereof a Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes, Prudential or any Prudential Affiliate may at its election at any time prior to Prudential’s receipt thereof cancel the closing with respect to such Accepted Notes by so notifying the Company in writing.

**2F.****Market Disruption.** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2E, if Prudential shall have provided interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph 2D and thereafter prior to the time an Acceptance with respect to such quotes shall have been notified to Prudential in accordance with paragraph 2E the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities or other financial instruments shall have closed or there shall have occurred a general suspension, material limitation, or significant disruption of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities or other financial instruments, then such interest rate quotes shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes. If the Company thereafter notifies Prudential of the Acceptance of any such interest rate quotes, such Acceptance shall be ineffective for all purposes of this Agreement, and Prudential shall promptly notify the Company that the provisions of this paragraph 2F are applicable with respect to such Acceptance.

**2G.**Facility Closings.** Not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City local time) on the Closing Day for any Accepted Notes, the Company will deliver to each Purchaser listed in the Confirmation of Acceptance relating thereto at the offices of [[Organization 3 Name]], [[Address 2: Address]], Attention: Law Department, or at such other place as Prudential may have directed, the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser in the form of one or more Notes in authorized denominations as such Purchaser may request for each Series of Accepted Notes to be purchased on the Closing Day, dated the Closing Day and registered in such Purchaser’s name (or in the name of its nominee), against payment of the purchase price thereof by transfer of immediately available funds for credit to the Company’s account specified in the Request for Purchase of such Notes. If the Company fails to tender to any Purchaser the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser on the scheduled Closing Day for such Accepted Notes as provided above in this paragraph 2G, or any of the conditions specified in paragraph 3 shall not have been fulfilled by the time required on such scheduled Closing Day, the Company shall, prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day notify Prudential (which notification shall be deemed received by each Purchaser) in writing whether (i) such closing is to be rescheduled (such rescheduled date to be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than one Business Day and not more than 10 Business Days after such scheduled Closing Day (the “Rescheduled Closing Day”**)) and certify to Prudential (which certification shall be for the benefit of each Purchaser) that the Company reasonably believes that it will be able to comply with the conditions set forth in paragraph 3 on such Rescheduled Closing Day and that the Company will pay the Delayed Delivery Fee in accordance with paragraph 2H(iii) or (ii) such closing is to be canceled. In the event that the Company shall fail to give such notice referred to in the preceding sentence, Prudential (on behalf of each Purchaser) may at its election, at any time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day, notify the Company in writing that such closing is to be canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary appearing in this Agreement, the Company may not elect to reschedule a closing with respect to any given Accepted Notes on more than one occasion, unless Prudential shall have otherwise consented in writing.

**2H.****Fees.**

**2H(i).**Structuring Fee.** At the time of the execution of this Agreement by the Company and Prudential, the Company will pay to each Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such Purchaser’s ratable portion (in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser) of a structuring fee (herein called the “Structuring Fee”**) in the aggregate amount for all Purchasers, of $[[USD Value 5: Number]]

**2H(ii).**Issuance Fee.** The Company will pay to each Purchaser in immediately available funds a fee (herein called the “Issuance Fee”**) on each Closing Day in an amount equal to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes sold to such Purchaser on such Closing Day, provided, however, that no Issuance Fee shall be due with respect to the initial issuance of any 

Shelf Notes pursuant to this Agreement if the Closing Day for such Shelf Notes is on or before [[Date 2: Date]].

**2H(iii).**Delayed Delivery Fee.** If the closing of the purchase and sale of any Accepted Note is delayed for any reason beyond the 42nd day following the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note, the Company will pay to the Purchaser which shall have agreed to purchase such Accepted Note (a) on the Cancellation Date or actual closing date of such purchase and sale and (b) if earlier, the next Business Day following 90 days after the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note and on each Business Day following 90 days after the prior payment hereunder, a fee (herein called the “Delayed Delivery Fee”**) calculated as follows:

\centered (BEY  MMY) X DTS/360 X PA

where **“BEY”** means Bond Equivalent Yield, i.e., the bond equivalent yield per annum of such Accepted Note; **“MMY”** means Money Market Yield, i.e., the yield per annum on a commercial paper investment of the highest quality selected by Prudential and having a maturity date or dates the same as, or closest to, the Rescheduled Closing Day or Rescheduled Closing Days for such Accepted Note (a new alternative investment being selected by Prudential each time such closing is delayed); **“DTS”** means Days to Settlement, i.e., the number of actual days elapsed from and including the 42nd day after the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note (in the case of the first such payment with respect to such Accepted Note) or from and including the date of the next preceding payment (in the case of any subsequent Delayed Delivery Fee payment with respect to such Accepted Note) to but excluding the date of such payment; and **“PA”** means Principal Amount, i.e., the principal amount of the Accepted Note for which such calculation is being made. In no case shall the Delayed Delivery Fee be less than zero. Nothing contained herein shall obligate any Purchaser to purchase any Accepted Note on any day other than the Closing Day for such Accepted Note, as the same may be rescheduled from time to time in compliance with paragraph 2G.

**2H(iv).**Cancellation Fee.** If the Company at any time notifies Prudential in writing that the Company is canceling the closing of the purchase and sale of any Accepted Note, or if Prudential notifies the Company in writing under the circumstances set forth in the last sentence of paragraph 2E or the penultimate sentence of paragraph 2G that the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note is to be canceled, or if the closing of the purchase and sale of such Accepted Note is not consummated on or prior to the last day of the Issuance Period (the date of any such notification or the last day of the Issuance Period, as the case may be, being herein called the “**Cancellation Date”**), the Company will pay to the Purchaser which shall have agreed to purchase such Accepted Note in immediately available funds an amount (the “Cancellation Fee”**) calculated as follows:

\centered [[Organization 4 Name]]

where **“PI”** means Price Increase, i.e., the quotient (expressed in decimals) obtained by dividing (a) the excess of the ask price (as determined by Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Note(s) on the Cancellation Date over the bid price (as determined by Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Notes(s) on the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note by (b) such bid price; and **“PA”** has the meaning ascribed to it in paragraph 2H(iii). The foregoing bid and ask prices shall be as reported on the [[Organization 5 Name]] service provided by [[Organization 6 Name]] (or, if such data for any reason ceases to be available through [[Organization 5 Name]], any publicly available source of similar market data). Each price shall be based on a U.S. Treasury security having a par value of $100.00 and shall be rounded to the second decimal place. In no case shall the Cancellation Fee be less than zero.

3.**CONDITIONS OF CLOSING.** Each Purchaser’s obligation to purchase and pay for the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser hereunder on any Closing Day is subject to the satisfaction, on or before such Closing Day, of the following conditions:

**3A.****Certain Documents.** Such Purchaser shall have received original counterparts or, if satisfactory to such Purchaser, certified or other copies of all of the following, each duly executed and delivered by the party or parties thereto, in form and substance satisfactory to such Purchaser dated the date of the applicable Closing Day unless otherwise indicated, and, on the applicable Closing Day, in full force and effect with no event having occurred and being then continuing that would constitute a default thereunder or constitute or provide the basis for the termination thereof:

^^^a certificate of corporate good standing for the Company from the Secretary of State of Delaware and of each state in which the Company is required to be qualified to transact business as a foreign organization, in each case dated as of a recent date except to the extent that failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and

The Company, by its execution hereof, hereby requests and authorizes such special counsel to render such opinions and to allow such Purchaser to rely on such opinions, agrees that the issuance and sale of any Notes will constitute a reconfirmation of such request and authorization, and understands and agrees that each Purchaser receiving such an opinion will and is hereby authorized to rely on such opinion.

**3D.****Representations and Warranties; No Default; Satisfaction of Conditions.** The representations and warranties contained in paragraph 8 shall be true on and as of such Closing Day, both before and immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes to be issued on such Closing Day and to the consummation of any other transactions contemplated hereby; there shall exist on such Closing Day no Event of Default or Default, both before and immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes to be issued on such Closing Day and to the consummation of any other transactions contemplated hereby; the Company shall have performed all agreements and satisfied all conditions required under this Agreement to be performed or satisfied on or before such Closing Day; and the Company shall have delivered to such Purchaser an Officer’s Certificate, dated such Closing Day, to each such effect.

**3E.****Purchase Permitted by Applicable Laws.** The purchase of and payment for the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser on such Closing Day on the terms and conditions herein provided (including the use of the proceeds of such Notes by the Company) shall not violate any applicable law or governmental regulation (including, without limitation, Section 5 of the Securities Act or Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and shall not subject such Purchaser to any tax, penalty, liability or other onerous condition under or pursuant to any applicable law or governmental regulation, and such Purchaser shall have received such certificates or other evidence as it may request to establish compliance with this condition. All necessary authorizations, consents, approvals, exceptions or other actions by or notices to or filings with any court or administrative or governmental body or other Person required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Notes to be issued on such Closing Day or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall have been issued or made, shall be final and in full force and effect and shall be in form and substance satisfactory to such Purchaser.

4.**PREPAYMENTS.** Any Shelf Notes shall be subject to prepayment only with respect to the required prepayments specified in paragraph 4A and paragraph 4E, the optional prepayments permitted by paragraph 4B, and upon acceleration pursuant to paragraph 7A.

**4A.****Required Prepayments.** Each Series of Shelf Notes shall be subject to required prepayments, if any, set forth in the Notes of such Series.

**4B.****Optional Prepayment With Yield-Maintenance Amount.** The Notes of each Series shall be subject to prepayment, in whole at any time or from time to time in part (in integral multiples of $[[USD Value 6: Number]] and in a minimum amount of $[[USD Value 7: Number]] on any one occurrence), at the option of the Company, at [[Percentage 1]]% of the principal amount so prepaid plus interest thereon to the prepayment date and the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect to each such Note. Any partial prepayment of a Series of Notes pursuant to this paragraph 4B shall be applied in satisfaction of required payments of principal thereof (including the required payment of principal due upon the maturity thereof) in inverse order of their scheduled due dates.

**4C.****Notice of Optional Prepayment.** The Company shall give the holder of each Note of a Series to be prepaid pursuant to paragraph 4B irrevocable written notice of such prepayment not less than 30 days prior to the prepayment date (which shall be a Business Day), specifying such prepayment date and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such Series, and the Notes of such Series held by such holder, to be prepaid on such date, and stating that such prepayment is to be made pursuant to paragraph 4B. Notice of prepayment having been given as aforesaid, the principal amount of the Notes specified in such notice, together with interest thereon to the prepayment date and together with the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect thereto, shall become due and payable on such prepayment date. The Company shall, on or before the day on which it gives written notice of any prepayment pursuant to paragraph 4B, give telephonic notice of the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid and the prepayment date to each Significant Holder which shall have designated a recipient of such notices in the Purchaser Schedule attached hereto or the applicable Confirmation of Acceptance or by notice in writing to the Company.

**4D.****Application of Prepayments.** In the case of each prepayment of less than the entire outstanding principal amount of all Notes of any Series pursuant to paragraphs 4A or 4B, the principal amount so prepaid shall be allocated pro rata to all Notes of such Series at the time outstanding in proportion to the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof.

**4E.****Offer to Prepay Notes in the Event of a Change of Control.**

**4E(1).****Notice of Change of Control.** The Company will, at least 30 days prior to any impending Change of Control, or if later promptly after the first public announcement of any impending Change of Control, give written notice of such Change of Control to each holder of the Notes. Such notice shall contain and constitute an offer to prepay the Notes as described in paragraph 4E(3) and shall be accompanied by the certificate described in paragraph 4E(6).

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Notes has been, or in the case of the Notes at the time of issuance will be, duly authorized by all requisite corporate action, and this Agreement and the Notes have been, or in the case of the Notes at the time of issuance will be, duly executed and delivered by authorized officers of the Company and are valid obligations of the Company, legally binding upon and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

**8B.****Financial Statements.** The Company has furnished to Prudential and will furnish to each Purchaser of any Note the following financial statements, identified by a principal financial officer of the Company: (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at [[Date 3: Date]] of each of the three fiscal years of the Company most recently completed prior to the date as of which this representation is made or repeated to such Purchaser (other than fiscal years completed within 90 days prior to such date for which audited financial statements have not been released) and consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each such year, all reported on by [[Organization 8 Name]] (or such other nationally recognized accounting firm as may be reasonably acceptable to Prudential and the Required Holder(s)) and (ii) consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of the quarterly period (if any) most recently completed prior to such date and after the end of such fiscal year (other than quarterly periods completed within 45 days prior to such date for which financial statements have not been released) and consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each such quarterly period and for the comparable quarterly period in the preceding fiscal year. The balance sheets fairly present the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and the statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows fairly present the results of the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods indicated. There has been no material adverse change in the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole since the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which such financial statements had been furnished to Prudential at the time of the execution of this Agreement by Prudential (in the case of the making of this representation at the time of the execution of this Agreement), or, in the case of the making of this representation at the time of the issuance of a Series of Shelf Notes, since the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this paragraph 8B had been provided to Prudential prior to the time Prudential provided the interest rate quote to the Company pursuant to paragraph 2D with respect to such Series of Shelf Notes.

All leases necessary in any material respect for the conduct of the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect.

**8F.****Taxes.** The Company has, and each of its Subsidiaries has, filed all Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns that are required to be filed, and each has paid all taxes as shown on such returns and on all assessments received by it to the extent that such taxes have become due, except such taxes as are being actively contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

**8G.****Conflicting Agreements and Other Matters.** The Company has disclosed to Prudential and the Required Holder(s) all agreements, instruments, and corporate or other restrictions to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to the Company, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Margin stock does not constitute more than [[Percentage 4]]% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any present intention that margin stock will constitute more than [[Percentage 4]]% of the value of such assets. The Company is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or any Note to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect.

**8J.****ERISA.** No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan).

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes will be exempt from or will not involve any transaction which is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA and will not involve any transaction in connection with which a penalty could be imposed under section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code. The representation by the Company in the next preceding sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of each Purchaser’s representation in paragraph 9B.

**8K.****Governmental Consent.** Neither the nature of the Company or of any Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or governmental body (other than routine filings after the Closing Day for any Notes with the 

Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue Sky authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes or fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes.

Each holder of any Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent authorized by this paragraph 11D, whether or not such Note shall have been marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may bear a notation referring to any such consent. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of any Note. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no negotiations or discussions in which Prudential or any holder of any Note may engage regarding any possible amendments, consents or waivers with respect to this Agreement or the Notes shall constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, any term of this Agreement or any Note or any rights of Prudential or any such holder under this Agreement or the Notes.

The Company shall keep at its principal office a register in which the Company shall provide for the registration of Notes and of transfers of Notes. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the principal office of the Company, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of a like aggregate principal amount, registered in the name of such transferee or transferees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall be in existence, the Company shall have the right to consent to any transfer of any Note (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that to the extent that the Company shall not have the right to consent to the transfer of the lenders’ rights and obligations under the Company’s primary bank facility or of any promissory notes privately placed by the Company except during the continuance of an event of default thereunder, then the Company shall notify Prudential and the holders of the Notes thereof and, at the option of the Required Holder(s), the foregoing right to consent to any transfer of any Note hereunder shall be suspended until the Company shall again have such right to consent under its primary bank facility and all private placements of promissory notes. At the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the principal office of the Company. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver the Notes which the holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed, by the holder of such Note or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing. Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that neither gain nor loss of interest shall result from any such transfer or exchange. Upon receipt of written notice from the holder of any Note of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Note and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of such holder’s unsecured indemnity agreement, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, the Company will make and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.

**11F. Persons Deemed Owners; Participations.** Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, interest on and any Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the Company shall not be affected by notice to the contrary. Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any Note may from time to time grant participations in all or any part of such Note to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder in its sole and absolute discretion.

**11G. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire Agreement.** All representations and warranties contained herein or made in writing by or on behalf of the Company in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the transfer by any Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any Transferee. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement and understanding between the Purchasers and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.

**11H. Successors and Assigns.** All covenants and other agreements in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto (including, without limitation, any Transferee) whether so expressed or not.

**11I.
