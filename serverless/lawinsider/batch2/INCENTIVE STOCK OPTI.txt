^If the Optionholder’s employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary is voluntarily terminated by the Optionholder, then the option shall lapse on the date of such termination of employment; provided, however, that if the Optionholder (A) terminates for “Good Reason” (as such term is defined in an employment or similar agreement applicable to the Optionholder) following a Change in Control or (B) terminates on or after reaching age 65, this Option may be exercised, to the

^^^^^ 
extent that the Optionholder was entitled to do so at the date of termination of employment, in whole at any time, or from time to time in part, within three months after the date of such termination, but in no event later than the expiration date specified in Paragraph 2(a) hereof.
^Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Optionholder’s employment termination of employment is a Termination or Dismissal for Cause, all rights to exercise this Option shall lapse on the date of such termination of employment.

If there shall be any other change in the number or kind of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, or of any stock or other securities into which such Common Stock shall have been changed, or for which it shall have been exchanged, and if a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall, in its sole discretion, determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment to the terms of this Option, then such adjustment shall be made in accordance with such determination. Any adjustment so made shall be final and binding upon the Optionholder.
^^No Rights as Shareholder. The Optionholder shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to this Option prior to the date of issuance of a certificate or certificates for such shares.
^^No Right To Continued Employment.

^^Compliance with Law and Regulations. This Option and the obligation of the Corporation to sell and deliver shares hereunder shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required.

^^^^^ 
^^Harmful Activity**.** Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Optionholder shall engage in any “harmful activity” while employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary or during the six-month period thereafter, then (i) this Option, to the extent then unexercised and whether vested or unvested, shall immediately be forfeited and canceled and (ii) any Profits realized upon the exercise of this Option shall inure to the Corporation.

Consistent with the provisions of the Plan, the determination by the Committee as to whether the Optionholder engaged in “harmful activity” while employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary or during the six-month period thereafter shall be final and conclusive, unless otherwise determined by a majority of disinterested members of the Board.

^Solicit or hire any employees of the Corporation or a Subsidiary or induce any of such employees to terminate their employment relationship with the Corporation or a Subsidiary. 

^Solicit, induce, or attempt to solicit or induce any customer, supplier, or other entity doing business with the Corporation of a Subsidiary to cease doing business with the Corporation or a Subsidiary or, in the case of a customer, to place agribusiness insurance, as that term is commonly understood in the industry, with any competitor of the Corporation or a Subsidiary. For purposes of the foregoing provision, the term “customer” shall mean a business that the Corporation or a Subsidiary insures on the date that the Optionholder’s employment terminates (or has insured during the previous twelve months) and a broker who has placed business with the Corporation or a Subsidiary on the date that the Optionholder’s employment terminates but only with respect to those clients of the broker for which the broker has placed business with the Corporation or a Subsidiary in the 12-month period preceding the date that the Optionholder’s employment terminates.

^Directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, render services for (as a consultant or an adviser), or accept any employment with, within a 50-mile radius of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, any other property and casualty insurance or reinsurance line of business to the extent that such ownership, management, operating, rendering of services, or employment (and the activities necessarily incident thereto) have, or could reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s or a Subsidiary’s business insurance business. 

^For any reason, in any fashion, form or manner, either directly or indirectly, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity, in any manner whatsoever, any confidential information or trade secrets concerning the business of the Corporation or a Subsidiary, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any customer lists or other customer identifying information, the techniques, methods or systems of the Corporation’s or a Subsidiary’s operations or management, any information regarding their respective financial matters, or any other material information concerning the business of the Corporation or a Subsidiary, their manner of operation, plan, or other material data. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to (i) information that is public knowledge other than as result of Optionholder’s authorized disclosure; (ii) information disseminated by the Corporation or a Subsidiary to third parties in the ordinary course of business; (iii) information lawfully received by the Optionholder from a third party who, based upon inquiry by the Optionholder, is not bound by a confidential relationship to the Corporation or a Subsidiary; or (iv) information disclosed under a requirement of law or as directed by applicable legal authority having jurisdiction over the Optionholder. 

^**Investment Representation**  
The Corporation may require the Optionholder to furnish to the Corporation, prior to the issuance of any shares upon the exercise of all or any part of this Option, an agreement (in such form as the Corporation may specify) in which the Optionholder represents that the shares acquired upon exercise are being acquired for investment and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof.
