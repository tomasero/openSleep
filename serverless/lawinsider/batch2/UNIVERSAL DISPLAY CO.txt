This EQUITY RETENTION AGREEMENT (this “**Agreement**”), effective as of [[Date 1: Date]] (the “**Date of Grant**”), is delivered by [[Organization 1 Name]] (the “**Company**”), to [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]] (the “**Grantee**”).

\centered **RECITALS**

[[Organization 1 Name]] Equity Compensation Plan (the “**Plan**”) provides for the grant of Stock Awards in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “**Committee**”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to make a significant Stock Award to the Grantee, subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement, as an inducement for the Grantee to:

·   Devote substantial time and attention to promotion and development of the Company at a time that is important for the future success of the Company;

·   Maintain a significant long-term ownership interest in the Company;

·   Continue in employment in order to ensure continuity of leadership and vision for the Company; and thereby

·   Increase shareholder value.

The Committee has determined that the Stock Award is reasonable and appropriate compensation for the services to be provided by the Grantee to the Company. References in this Agreement to capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings given to those terms in the Plan.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

^**Stock Award**. As approved by the Committee, the Company hereby grants to the Grantee [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of common stock of the Company, subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth below and in the Plan (the “**Stock Award**”).

^**Vesting and Restriction on Disposition of the Stock Award**.

^^The Stock Award shall become vested according to the following schedule, if the Grantee continues to be employed by the Company from the Date of Grant until the applicable vesting date.

The vesting of the Stock Award shall be cumulative, but shall not exceed [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the Stock Award.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stock Award shall vest in accordance with the terms of the Grantee’s Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement dated [[Date 2: Date]], between the Company and the Grantee (the “**Change in Control Agreement**”) in the event of a Change in Control, as defined in the Change in Control Agreement (a “**Change in Control**”).

^^If the Grantee ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason before the Stock Award is fully vested, the shares of the Stock Award that are not then vested shall be forfeited and must be immediately returned to the Company. The Stock Award (whether or not vested) may also be forfeited under the circumstances described in Section 4 below.

^^In no event may any unvested shares of the Stock Award be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered by the Grantee before the shares vest. After shares of the Stock Award vest, the vested shares (net of any applicable tax withholding) may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered by the Grantee until the fifth anniversary of the of vesting of said shares, except in the event of the Grantee’s death or a Change in Control. With respect to each share subject to the Stock Award, the “**Restriction Period**” is the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the fir st to occur of the fifth anniversary of the date of vesting of such share, the Grantee’s death or a Change in Control. Any attempt to assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the shares contrary to the provisions hereof, and the levy of any execution, attachment or similar process upon such shares, shall be null, void and without effect.

^**Issuance of Certificates**.  
^^Stock certificates representing the Stock Award, with appropriate legends reflecting the restrictions under this Agreement, may be issued by the Company to the Grantee or may be held in escrow by the Company during the Restriction Period, as determined by the Committee. When the Grantee obtains a vested right to shares of the Stock Award, the Grantee shall have the right to receive a certificate representing the vested shares (net of any applicable tax withholding), with appropriate legends reflecting the restrictions under this Agreement. During the Restriction Period, the Grantee shall receive any cash dividends with respect to the shares of the Stock Award, may vote the shares of the Stock Award and may p articipate in any distribution pursuant to a plan of dissolution or complete liquidation of the Company. In the event of a dividend or distribution payable in stock or other property or a reclassification, split up or similar event during the Restriction Period, the shares or other property issued or declared
