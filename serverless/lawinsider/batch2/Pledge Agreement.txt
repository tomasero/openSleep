^^**Attorney-in-Fact****.** The Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Secured Party as its attorney-in-fact to do (but the Secured Party shall not be obligated to and shall not incur any liability to the Pledgor or any third party for failure to do) any act that the Pledgor is obligated by this Agreement to do, and (subject to Section 6.1 below) to exercise such rights and powers as the Pledgor might exercise with respect to the Pledged Collateral, including without limitation, the right to:

It is further agreed and understood between the parties hereto that such care as the Secured Party gives to the safekeeping of its own property of like kind constitutes reasonable care of the Pledged Collateral when in the Secured Party’s possession; provided, however, that the Secured Party will not be required to make any presentment, demand, or protest, or give any notice and need not take any action to preserve any rights against any prior party or any other person in connection with the Secured Obligations or with respect to the Pledged Collateral.

^^**Irrevocable Interests****.** All the foregoing powers authorized in this Section 5, being coupled with an interest, are irrevocable so long as any of the Secured Obligations are outstanding.

^TRANSFER, VOTING, DIVIDENDS, ETC.

^^**Prior to Event of Default****.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, so long as no Event of Default (as defined herein) has occurred and is continuing:

^^The Pledgor is entitled to exercise all voting powers pertaining to all shares of stock and other securities constituting the Pledged Collateral for all purposes not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;

^^The Pledgor is entitled to receive and retain all dividends (other than shares of stock or liquidating dividends) and all interest payments payable in respect of the Pledged Collateral; provided, that such dividends or interest payments are permitted by the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and provided, further, however, that all shares of stock or property representing shares of stock or liquidating dividends or a distribution or return of capital upon or in respect of the shares of stock constituting the Pledged Collateral or resulting from a split-up, revision, or reclassification of the Pledged Collateral or received in exchange therefor, as a result of a merger, consolidation, or otherwise, must be paid or transferred directly to the Secured Party immediately upon receipt thereof by the Pledgor and be retained by the Secured Party as Pledged Collateral hereunder; and

^^**During Event of Default****.** If any Event of Default (as defined herein) has occurred and while the same is continuing:

^^The Secured Party or its nominee or nominees may, if the Secured Party so elects by written notice to the Pledgor, have the sole and exclusive right to exercise all voting powers pertaining to the shares of stock constituting Pledged Collateral, and may exercise such powers in such manner as the Secured Party may elect, and the Pledgor hereby grants the Secured Party an irrevocable proxy, coupled with an interest, to vote such shares of stock; provided, however, that such proxy will terminate upon termination of the Secured Party’s security interest in the Pledged Collateral; and

^^All dividends and other distributions and profits made upon or in respect of the Pledged Collateral and all interest payments must be paid directly to and be retained by the Secured Party as Pledged Collateral hereunder (or applied to the Secured Obligations, consistent with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement).

^DEFAULT AND REMEDIES  
^^**Events of Default****.** Any “Event of Default” as defined in the Credit Agreement shall be an “Event of Default” hereunder.

^^**Remedies upon Default****.** If an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(j) of the Credit Agreement occurs with respect to the Pledgor, then to the extent permitted by applicable law, all Secured Obligations shall become automatically due and payable by the Pledgor, without any action by the Secured Party or notice of any kind. In addition, or if any other Event of Default exists, the Secured Party may in its discretion do any one or more of the following from time to time (upon such notice to the Pledgor as may be required by applicable law after giving effect to the agreements and waivers contained herein):

^^declare any Secured Obligations immediately due and payable, whereupon they shall be due and payable without diligence, presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, including notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration, all of which are hereby waived by the Pledgor to the fullest extent permitted by law;

^^settle, compromise, or release, on terms acceptable to the Secured Party, in whole or in part, any amounts owing on the Pledged Collateral, and to extend the time of payment, in the Secured Party’s name or in the name of the Pledgor, in respect thereof;

^^apply to the payment of the Secured Obligations, or collect the Pledged Collateral, notwithstanding any forfeiture of interest or loss of other rights of the Pledgor against any obligor on the Pledged Collateral resulting from such action;

^^sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral in accordance with applicable law, either at public or private sale, on any broker’s board or securities exchange, in lots or in bulk, for cash, on credit, or otherwise, with or without representations or warranties, and upon such terms as are acceptable to the Secured Party; and

^^exercise any other default rights or remedies afforded under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement, by law, at equity or otherwise, including the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Illinois as in effect from time to time.

^^**Application of Proceeds****.** The net cash proceeds resulting from the collection, liquidation, sale, or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral will be applied first to the expenses (including all attorneys’ fees) of holding, storing, preparing for sale, selling, collecting, liquidating, and the like, including any brokerage commissions and stamp or transfer taxes, and then to the satisfaction of all Secured Obligations, application as to any particular obligation or indebtedness or against principal or interest to be in the Secured Party’s absolute discretion.

^^**Securities Act****.** If by reason of any prohibition contained in the Securities Act, as now or hereafter in effect, or in applicable Illinois or other state securities laws, as now or hereafter in effect, or in any rules or regulations pertaining to any of the foregoing laws, the Secured Party believes in its sole judgment that it is compelled to resort to one or more private sales of shares of stock constituting Pledged Collateral to a single purchaser or a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, the Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that private sales of such Pledged Collateral may be held notwithstanding that such sales may be at prices and on other terms less favorable to the Pledgor than if such Pledged Collateral were sold at public sale. The Pledgor further agrees that the Secured Party has no obligation to delay the sale of any such Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit registration of the Pledged Collateral, even if the issuer thereof would, or should, agree to register such Pledged Collateral for public sale under applicable securities laws. The Pledgor specifically agrees that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a “commercially reasonable” manner.

^^**Duty of Secured Party****.** The Secured Party is not under any duty or obligation whatsoever to collect any dividends, interest, profits, or other payments due or accruing in respect of the Pledged Collateral or to take any action to preserve rights in connection with any Pledged Collateral, including without limitation, making or giving any presentment, demands for performance, notices of non-performance, protests, notices of protest, or notices of dishonor in connection with any Pledged Collateral.

^^**Return; Acquittance****.** The Secured Party may deliver any Pledged Collateral to the Pledgor at any time and the receipt thereof by the Pledgor will be a complete and full acquittance in respect of the Pledged Collateral so delivered, and the Secured Party will thereafter be discharged from any liability or responsibility therefor.

^^**Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver**.  
7.7.1. **Cumulative Rights**. All covenants, conditions, provisions, warranties, guaranties, indemnities, and other undertakings of the Pledgor contained in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not in derogation or substitution of each other. In particular, the rights and remedies of the Secured Party are cumulative, may be exercised at any time and from time to time, concurrently or in any order, and shall not be exclusive of any other rights or remedies that the Secured Party may have, whether under any agreement, by law, at equity, or otherwise.

7.7.2. **Waivers**. The failure or delay of the Secured Party to require strict performance by the Pledgor with any terms of the Loan Documents, or to exercise any rights or remedies with respect to Pledged Collateral or otherwise, shall not operate as a waiver thereof nor as establishment of a course of dealing. All rights and remedies shall continue in full force and effect until all of the Secured Obligations, both for principal and interest, have been fully paid and satisfied and all agreements of the Secured Party to extend credit to or for the account of the Pledgor have expired or otherwise have been terminated. No modification of any terms of any Loan Documents (including any waiver thereof) shall be effective, unless such modification is specifically provided in a writing directed to the Pledgor and executed by the Secured Party, and such modification shall be applicable only to the matter specified. No waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall constitute a waiver of any other Default or Event of Default that may exist at such time, unless expressly stated. If the Secured Party accepts performance by the Pledgor under any Loan Document in a manner other than that specified therein, or during any Default or Event of Default, or if the Secured Party shall delay or exercise any right or remedy under any Loan Document, such acceptance, delay, or exercise shall not operate to waive any Default or Event of Default nor to preclude exercise of any other right or remedy.
