This Warrant is issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement, dated [[Date 2: Date]], executed by and between the Investor and the Company (the “Exchange Agreement”). 

^TERM. Subject to the terms hereof, the purchase right represented by this Warrant is exercisable, in whole, at any time from and after the Grant Date and at or prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the date five (5) years following the Grant Date (the “Expiration Date”). The number of Shares, type of security and Exercise Price (as that term is defined in Section 2 hereof) are subject to adjustment as provided herein, and all references to “Exercise Price” herein shall be deemed to include any such adjustment or series of adjustments. Terms used

^^^^^ 
herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning as set forth in the Exchange Agreement.

^NUMBER OF SHARES AND EXERCISE PRICE. Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Investor is entitled, upon surrender of this Warrant prior to the Expiration Date, to purchase from the Company,  shares of Common Stock. The purchase price for the shares of the Common Stock purchased pursuant to this Warrant shall be equal to the lesser of (i) $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share, (ii) $[[USD Value 2: Number]] per share, (iii) in the event that the Company consummates a public offering other than pursuant to an employee benefit plan of the Company, including an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission notwithstanding that such registered offering might be deemed a private offering under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635 (a “Public Offering”), the price per share for shares of Common Stock in any such Public Offering, or (iv) in the event that the Company consummates a private placement of shares of Common Stock in exchange exclusively for cash consideration pursuant to Regulation D, the Regulation D private placement offering price per share for shares of Common Stock in any such private placement (“Exercise Price”)

^METHOD OF EXERCISE. The purchase right represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the Investor, in whole or in part and from time to time, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise form attached hereto as Exhibit A duly executed) at the principal office of the Company accompanied by payment to the Company, by certified check, or wire transfer payable to the Company, in an amount equal to the then applicable Exercise Price per share multiplied by the number of Shares then being purchased. Thereupon, the Investor, as the holder of this Warrant, shall be entitled to receive from the Company a stock certificate representing the number of Shares so purchased which shall be delivered to the Investor as soon as possible and in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, surrendered Warrant and proper payment, and a new warrant in substantially identical form and dated as of such date of exercise shall be issued to the Investor for the purchase of that number of Shares equal to the difference, if any, between the number of Shares subject to this Warrant and the number of Shares as to which this Warrant is so exercised. The Investor shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of, the Shares represented thereby (and such Shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the close of business on the date or dates upon which this Warrant is exercised.

^STOCK FULLY PAID: RESERVATION OF SHARES. The Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be fully paid and non assessable, and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. During the period within which the rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized, subject to shareholder approval, if required by applicable law, and reserved for the purpose of issuance upon exercise of the purchase rights

^^^^^ 
evidenced by this Warrant, a sufficient number of Shares to provide for the exercise of the right represented by this Warrant.

^ADJUSTMENT OF WARRANT PRICE AND NUMBER OF SHARES. The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as follows:

^^Reclassification or Merger. If at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired, in case of any reclassification, change or conversion of securities of the class issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or in case of any merger of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a merger with another corporation in which the Company is a continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant), or in case of any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Company, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute a new Warrant (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Investor) providing that the Investor shall have the right to exercise such new Warrant and upon such exercise to receive, in lieu of each share of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification, change or merger by a holder of one share of Common Stock. Such new Warrant shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Paragraph 5. The provisions of this subparagraph (a) shall similarly apply to successive reclassification, changes, mergers and transfers.

^^Subdivisions or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired shall subdivide or combine its Common Stock, the number of Shares issuable upon exercise hereof, shall be proportionally adjusted and the Exchange Price shall be adjusted so that the aggregate exercise price of this Warrant shall at all time remains equal.

^^Common Stock Dividends. If the Company at any time while this Warrant is outstanding and unexpired shall pay a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock (except any distribution specifically provided for in the foregoing subparagraphs (a) and (b)), then the Exercise Price shall be adjusted, from and after the date of determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, to that price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such date of determination by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the total

^^^^^ 
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution and the number of Shares subject to this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted.

^^No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Paragraph 5 and in the taking of all such action as maybe necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Investor against impairment.

^NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS. Whenever the Exercise Price shall be adjusted pursuant to the provisions hereof, the Company shall within thirty (30) days of such adjustment deliver a certificate signed by its chief financial officer to the Investor setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated, and the Exercise Price after giving effect to such adjustment.

^FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional Shares of Common Stock will be issued in connection with any exercise hereunder, but in lieu of such fractional Shares the Company shall make a cash payment equal to the excess of the average daily closing price of the Company’s common stock for the twenty (20) business days prior to the exercise date for such fractional shares above the Warrant Price for such fractional share.

^TRANSFERS AND EXCHANGES. This Warrant shall be transferable by the Investor provided that the Investor in connection with such transfer delivers to the Company an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that registration is not required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any applicable state securities laws.

^RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDERS. The Investor, as holder of this Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of Common Stock, or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof for any purpose, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the Investor, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until this Warrant shall have been exercised and the Shares purchasable upon the exercise hereof shall have become deliverable, as provided herein.
