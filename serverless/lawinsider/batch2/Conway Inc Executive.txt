Employees who first become Executives, through hire or promotion, during a calendar year, and who as a result of such hire or promotion become eligible to participate in the XIP, shall commence participation on the date that they become an Executive. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5, a Participant who ceases to serve as an Executive during a calendar year shall no longer be eligible to participate in this XIP effective on the date that he or she ceases to serve as an Executive.

^**Establishment of Awards****.**

^^Awards. For each calendar year during the term of this XIP, each Executive who is a Participant during that calendar year shall receive an Award hereunder, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof.

^^Incentive Performance Goals. For each calendar year, and not later than ninety (90) days following the commencement of that calendar year, the Committee shall, for each of the Participants who are Designated Executives during that calendar year, and the CEO shall, for each of the other Participants, establish one or more Incentive Performance Goal(s) to apply to the Participant’s Award.

The terms and conditions applicable to Participants for a

calendar year need not be identical, even within Business Units. The percentage goal weights for the Incentive Performance Goals assigned to a Participant shall add to [[Percentage 2: Number]]%.

Incentive Performance Goals established under this XIP may include any goal that falls within the definition of Performance Goal in the EIP. Subject to the requirement set forth in the preceding sentence, possible Incentive Performance Goals may include, but are not limited to, the following:

·   earnings before interest and taxes

·   other profit measures

·   cash flow

·   sales or revenues

·   return on equity, assets, capital or investment

Each Incentive Performance Goal may be determined with respect to the Company or a Business Unit on a consolidated or unconsolidated basis.

^^Participation Percentage. Unless otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator, each Participant’s Participation Percentage for each calendar year shall be the Participation Percentage applicable to Executives in the executive level salary grade to which the Participant is assigned at the time the Plan Administrator establishes Incentive Performance Goals for the calendar year. Executives who become Participants in this XIP during the year as provided in Section 3 shall have the same Participation Percentage as other Participants in the same

salary grade level. For Participants who are promoted during a calendar year to a salary grade which has been assigned a higher or lower Participation Percentage, such Participant’s Award Payout shall be determined based on the respective amounts of Annual Compensation earned while each Participation Percentage was applicable to such Participant.

^^Percentage Achievement. For each calendar year, for each Incentive Performance Goal, the Plan Administrator shall set a Minimum Payment Goal, a Target Payment Goal, and a Maximum Payment Goal and may set intermediate levels and assign intermediate percentage factors to such levels. If the achievement of that Incentive Performance Goal is at or below the Minimum Payment Goal, the percentage achievement shall be zero, and no Award Payout shall be earned or paid with respect to that Incentive Performance Goal. If the achievement of that Incentive Performance Goal is between levels, the percentage achievement shall be earned ratably, determined by straight line interpolation, for accomplishment between the next lower level and the next higher level. If the achievement is above the Maximum Payment Goal, the percentage achievement shall equal [[Percentage 1]]%. In no event shall any Participant’s total Award Payout (based on all applicable Incentive Performance Goals), exceed an amount equal to [[Percentage 1]]% of the product of the Participant’s Annual Compensation times the Participant’s Participation Percentage.

^^Transfers between Business Units Subject to XIP. If a Participant transfers from one Business Unit to another Business Unit during a calendar year, the Participant’s Award Payout shall be based in part on the performance of each Business Unit that employs the Participant during that calendar year. The Award Payout shall be determined by taking into account, for each such Business Unit, (i) the Annual Compensation earned while employed by that Business Unit; (ii) the achievement of the Incentive Performance Goals applicable to Awards made to Executives employed by that Business Unit, and (iii) the Participation Percentage applicable to Participant while employed by the Business Unit, and the total Award Payout shall be equal to the sum of the Award Payouts determined with respect to each Business Unit..

^**Vesting****.**   
Subject to the following exceptions, no Participant shall receive an Award Payout under the XIP unless on the date that the payment is actually made the Participant is then currently (i) employed by the Company or an Affiliate and (ii) a Participant.

^^Exception 1. A Participant who is employed by the Company or an Affiliate through [[Date 3: Date]] of a calendar year but who subsequently leaves that employment or otherwise becomes ineligible after [[Date 3]] but before the sole or final payment is made relating to that calendar year, as provided in Section 7, shall be entitled to receive an Award Payout with respect to such calendar year, unless the Participant is Terminated for Cause prior to the date that Award Payouts are made to Participants..

^^Exception 2. A payment based on the Annual Compensation earned while a Participant was eligible to participate in the calendar year will be made, as provided in Section 7, to (i) a Participant who terminates their employment after reaching age 55 with at least 10 years of service (which shall be considered “retirement” for purposes of this XIP), (ii) the heirs, legatees, administrators or executors of a Participant who dies during the calendar year and who, at the time of death, was a Participant, (iii) a Participant who is placed on an approved leave during the calendar year, and (iv) a Participant who ceases to serve as an Executive during the calendar year but remains an Active Regular Employee; in each case unless the Participant is Terminated for Cause prior to the date that Award Payouts are made to Participants.

In case of doubt, the Plan Administrator shall determine whether or not cause exists, in its sole discretion, using whatever standard it deems appropriate.

^**Amount of Award Payout**.   
Award Payouts. Subject to the other provisions of this XIP, a Participant’s Award Payout for a calendar year shall be equal to the sum of the products of, for each assigned Incentive Performance Goal:

^^the Participant’s Annual Compensation, multiplied by

^^the Participant’s Participation Percentage, multiplied by

^^the percentage achievement of the Incentive Performance Goal, multiplied by

^^the percentage goal weight for the Incentive Performance Goal.

^**Payment of Award****.**

^^Payment. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 7, the Award Payout with respect to a calendar year shall be paid in cash to each Participant as soon as administratively practicable following completion of the annual audit of the Company’s financial statements for that calendar year by the Company’s outside auditors and, for Participants who are Covered Employees, after written certification by the Committee that the Incentive Performance Goal and other material terms of the Award for the calendar year have been satisfied, and the amount of the Award Payout has been finally determined, but in no event later than [[Date 4: Date]] of the following calendar year. Participants who retire during the calendar year and who, pursuant to Section 5 above, are entitled to receive Award Payouts for that calendar year will receive the payouts at the same time as other Participants receive their Award Payouts.

With respect to the foregoing Committee certification requirement, approved written minutes of the Committee meeting in which the certification is made shall be treated as written certification.

^^Death. In the event of a Participant's death, the Award Payout payable in paragraph (a) above with respect to a Participant for a calendar year shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary. "Beneficiary" means the person or persons designated by the Participant pursuant to a beneficiary designation form properly completed and delivered to the Senior Vice President of Human Resources of the Company. If no such beneficiary designation form is in effect, then the Beneficiary shall be the beneficiary designated by Participant under the Con-way Retirement Savings Plan. In the event the Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary under such plan, then the Participant’s Beneficiary will be the Participant’s estate.

^^Adjustments. In the event that the Committee determines that (i) the Award Payout payable to one or more Participants for a calendar year has been or is likely to be materially affected as a result of events or circumstances that were unanticipated at the beginning of the calendar year and/or extraordinary in nature and (ii) the goals of the XIP would be frustrated if adjustments were not made to such Award Payouts, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may make such adjustments applicable to the Performance Goals or to such Award Payouts as it deems appropriate, which adjustments may have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of the Award Payouts otherwise payable pursuant to the XIP; **provided, however**, that if the Committee intends that the deduction for payment of an Award to a Covered Employee not be limited or eliminated by application of Section 162(m) of the Code, then the Committee shall not make any such adjustment which would increase the payment with respect to such Award unless such adjustment is not inconsistent with Section 162(m) of the Code.

^^Clawback Provision. In the event that the financial statements of the Company or a Business Unit are restated following the payment of an Award and that restatement would have changed the Award Payout, the following repayment terms apply to those executives who were Section 16 Officers at the time the payment was made:

^^^In the event a financial statement restatement is required within one year following a payment as a result of errors or omissions, the executives will be required to repay any amounts that are deemed to have been overpaid based on that restatement.

^^^In the event a financial statement restatement is required at any time as a result of fraudulent activities, the executives will be required to repay any amounts that are deemed to have been overpaid based on that restatement for an unlimited period of time.

^**Amendment; Termination****.**   
^^Amendment and Termination. Subject to and consistent with the requirements of Section 12 of the EIP, the Committee may amend the XIP at any time by notice to the Participants. No amendment shall reduce a Participant’s right to receive Award Payout finally awarded but unpaid to such Participant at the time of amendment or termination. No Award shall be granted after the XIP’s termination.

^^Automatic Termination. The XIP will automatically terminate when the EIP expires or is terminated, and the Committee may terminate the XIP at any earlier time. Notwithstanding the termination of the XIP, the Award Payouts for each calendar year then in progress shall be calculated, and be payable, following the completion of each such calendar year, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5 and 6.

^**Code Section 409A Compliance****.** It is intended that the Awards are either exempt from the requirements of Code section 409A and regulatory guidance issued thereunder or will satisfy such requirements (in form and operation) so that Award Payouts shall not be included in income under Code section 409A and the XIP will be interpreted and construed in a manner that is consistent with such intent.

^**Effective Date.** The effective date of this XIP (“Effective Date”) is [[Date 5: Date]].
