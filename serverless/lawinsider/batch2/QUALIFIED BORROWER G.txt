WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, a Qualified Borrower may request that the Banks make one or more loans (each, a “Loan”) to the Qualified Borrower, to be guaranteed by Guarantor by this Guaranty and to be evidenced by Qualified Borrower Notes (collectively, the “Note”), payable by the Qualified Borrower to the order of the Banks. 

WHEREAS, this Guaranty is the “Qualified Borrower Guaranty” referred to in the Credit Agreement; 

WHEREAS, in order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to make one or more Loans to one or more Qualified Borrowers, and to satisfy one of the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement with respect thereto, the Guarantor has agreed to enter into this Guaranty. 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the direct and indirect benefits to be derived from the making of the Loans by the Banks to Qualified Borrowers, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows: 

^Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely, and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all obligations of each and every Qualified Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Note (whether executed and delivered simultaneously herewith or subsequently), or under any of the other Loan Documents (such obligations, whenever arising, being the “Guaranteed Obligations”), and any and all reasonable costs and 

^^^^^ 
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent in enforcing its rights under this Guaranty. 

^It is agreed that the obligations of Guarantor hereunder are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent against the relevant Qualified Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in such Qualified Borrower’s financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent against such Qualified Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor hereby agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent has specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Banks would not make Loans and the Fronting Bank would not issue Letters of Credit on behalf of any Qualified Borrower. 

^Guarantor hereby waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, set-off or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding in law, equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by the relevant Qualified Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor’s right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor’s right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or 

^^^^^ 
proceeding. Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses of any kind against the Administrative Agent, the Banks or the Fronting Bank. 

^The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between any Qualified Borrower and the Administrative Agent the obligations of such Qualified Borrower under the Loan Documents. 

^This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of Guarantor: 

^^any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or 

^^any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to any Qualified Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or 

^^any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or 

^^any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or 

^^any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or 

^^the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or 

^^any Qualified Borrower’s or the Guarantor’s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of any Qualified Borrower’s or Guarantor’s assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the 

^^^^^ 
commencement of other similar proceedings affecting any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or Guarantor’s liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or 

^^any improper disposition by any Qualified Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to honor any request made by any Qualified Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to see the proper disposition by such Qualified Borrower of such proceeds. 

^^Guarantor hereby agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from any Qualified Borrower under any of the Notes or other Loan Documents or Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor), then Guarantor’s obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by the Administrative Agent, and Guarantor’s obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment to the Administrative Agent had never been made. 

^^Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, the Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (ii) hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; and (iii) from and after an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) subordinates any liability or indebtedness of any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor to the obligations of each Qualified Borrower under the Loan Documents. 

^Guarantor hereby represents, warrants and covenants on its own behalf to the Administrative Agent with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent is relying upon the same, as follows: 

^^Guarantor will be familiar with the financial condition of each Qualified Borrower; 

^^Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into this Guaranty;

The foregoing representations and warranties shall be deemed to be made as of the date hereof and as the date of the making any Loan or the issuance of any Letter of Credit to or for the account on any Qualified Borrower.
