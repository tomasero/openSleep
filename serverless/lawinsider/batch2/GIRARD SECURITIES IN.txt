Such financial advisory services to the Company will include: (i) evaluating and advising on a continuing basis following the IPO, the Company’s financial condition and capital structure, and (ii) assisting and advising the Company in connection with proposed corporate acquisitions as well as future debt and equity financings to finance such acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. The purpose of this letter agreement is to memorialize the terms of our engagement by the Company.

We agree that all nonpublic information obtained by us in connection with our engagement will be held by us in strict confidence and will be used by us solely for the purpose of performing our obligations relating to our engagement. 

We do not assume any responsibility for, or with respect to, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information and data supplied to us by the Company or its representatives. In addition, the Company acknowledges that we will assume, without independent verification, that all information supplied to us with respect to the Company will be true, correct and complete in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statements of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the information supplied to us not misleading.
