^^The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Roth, its affiliates, directors and officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls Roth within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which Roth or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, including the information deemed to be a part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness and at any subsequent time pursuant to Rules 430A and 430B of the Rules and Regulations, the Time of Sale Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto (including any documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any materials or information provided to Investors by, or with the written approval of, the Company in connection with the marketing of the Offering of the Securities, including any roadshow or investor presentations (whether in person or electronically) (“Marketing Materials”), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (ii) in whole or in part, any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein, or (iii) in whole or in part, any failure of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or under applicable law, and will reimburse Roth for any documented, out of pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with evaluating, investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; *provided, however*, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Marketing Materials, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by Roth specifically for use in the preparation thereof, and *provided*, *further*, that such indemnity with respect to any Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or Marketing Materials shall not inure to the benefit of Roth (or any person controlling Roth) if such loss, claim, damage or liability (i) results from a failure by Roth to send or give a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to such person, if Roth was furnished a copy thereof for such purpose by the Company, at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person and such delivery is required by the Act. 

^^Roth will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Roth), insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Marketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Marketing Materials, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by Roth specifically for use in the preparation thereof, and will reimburse the Company for any documented, out of pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with evaluating, investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. 

^^Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b), above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent such indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of the indemnifying party’s election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable, documented, out of pocket costs of investigation; *provided*, *however*, that if (i) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (ii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on the reasonable advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), or (iii) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ a single counsel to represent it in any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 8, in which event the reasonable, documented, out of pocket fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party or parties and reimbursed to the indemnified party as incurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, in no event shall an indemnifying party be required to pay fees and expenses for more than one firm of attorneys (and local counsel) representing all indemnified parties. 

The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (not to be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is a party or could be named and indemnity was or would be sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability for claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 

^^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b), above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and Roth, on the other hand, from the Offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and Roth, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and Roth, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total placement agent fees received by Roth, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities set forth on such cover. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or Roth and the parties’ relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and Roth agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim that is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection (d), Roth shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of Roth’s placement agent fees actually received by Roth from the Offering of the Securities. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

^^The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and the benefits of such obligations shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls Roth within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act; and the obligations of Roth under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that Roth may otherwise have and the benefits of such obligations shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to the Company, and its officers, directors and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. 

^^For purposes of this Agreement, Roth confirms, and the Company acknowledges, that there is no information concerning Roth furnished in writing to the Company by Roth specifically for preparation of or inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, other than the statements regarding Roth set forth in the “Plan of Distribution” section of the Final Prospectus and Time of Sale Disclosure Package, only insofar as such statement relate to the amount of selling concession and related activities that may be undertaken by Roth. 

^Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties, and agreements of the Company herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto including, but not limited to, the agreements of Roth and the Company contained in Section 1(b), Section 6(h) and Section 8 hereof, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Roth or any controlling person thereof, or the Company or any of its officers, directors, or controlling persons, and shall survive delivery of, and payment for, the Securities to and by Roth hereunder.

Any party to this Agreement may change such address for notices by sending to the parties to this Agreement written notice of a new address for such purpose.

Except as indicated above, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give to any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. 

^Absence of Fiduciary Relationship. The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Roth has been retained solely to act as placement agent in connection with the sale of the Securities and that no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Company and Roth has been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, irrespective of whether Roth has advised or is advising the Company on other matters; (b) the price and other terms of the Securities set forth in this Agreement were established by Roth and the Investors following discussions and arms-length negotiations and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (c) it has been advised that Roth and its affiliates are engaged in a broad range of transactions that may involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that Roth has no obligation to disclose such interest and transactions to the Company by virtue of any fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship; (d) it has been advised that Roth is acting, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, solely for the benefit of Roth, and not on behalf of the Company. 

^No Limitations. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of Roth or its affiliates to (a) trade in the Company’s or any other company’s securities or publish research on the Company or any other company, subject to applicable law, or (b) pursue or engage in investment banking, financial advisory or other business relationships with entities that may be engaged in or contemplate engaging in, or acquiring or disposing of, businesses that are similar to or competitive with the business of the Company. 

^Amendments and Waivers. No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. The failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver be deemed or constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. 

^Partial Unenforceability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section, paragraph, clause or provision. 

^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission and electronic mail attaching a portable document file (.pdf)) in one or more counterparts and, if executed and delivered in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
