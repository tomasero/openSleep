^ \centered SECTION 1. PURPOSE AND TERM 

^^ \centered 1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this Income Security Plan (this “Plan”) is to provide income security protection to certain executives of [[Organization 1 Name]] (the “Company”) in order to (a) ensure that such executives make good corporate decisions with respect to a possible Change in Control (as defined in Section 2.1) of the Company, even if such a Change in Control may have adverse personal consequences (such as the loss of the executive’s employment with the Company), (b) maximize stockholder value by keeping such executives engaged during periods of uncertainty relating to a possible Change in Control, and (c) provide such executives with the ability to transition to new employment if their employment with the Company is terminated as a result of a Change in Control. 

^^ \centered 1.2 Type of Plan. This Plan is a severance pay plan maintained primarily for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated individuals within the meaning of ERISA (as defined in Section 2.1). This Plan will be administered and interpreted (i) in a manner consistent with such intent and (ii) in accordance with Section 409A of the Code (as defined in Section 2.1) and other applicable Tax (as defined in Section 2.1) laws and regulations, including, without limitation, any regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its officers, directors, agents or affiliates will be obligated, directly or indirectly, to any Participant for any Taxes that may be imposed on such Participant (a) on account of any amounts due or paid under this Plan (except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 6) or (b) on account of any failure to comply with any provision of the Code.

^^^ \centered (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, a Participant will be entitled to receive from the Company any Unpaid Compensation and the Severance Benefits described in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 (as applicable) if (i) during the term of this Plan, a Change in Control occurs and (ii) within 36 months thereafter, the Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or voluntarily by the Participant for Good Reason, in the latter case within two years after the circumstances comprising Good Reason first arise. The termination of a Participant’s employment that entitles the Participant to Severance Benefits pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) is referred to in this Plan as a “Post-Change in Control Qualifying Termination.” A “Post-Change in Control Qualifying Termination” will not include a termination of a Participant’s employment by reason of death or Disability, the Company’s termination of a    


^^^ \centered Participant’s employment for Cause or a Participant’s voluntary termination without Good Reason. 

^^^ \centered (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, a Participant will also be entitled to receive from the Company any Unpaid Compensation and the Severance Benefits described in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 (as applicable) if (i) during the term of this Plan, a Change Event and a Change in Control occur and (ii) within 12 months after such Change Event and no more than 12 months prior to such Change in Control, such Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or voluntarily by the Participant for Good Reason, in the latter case within two years after the circumstances comprising Good Reason first arise; provided, however, that the Participant will only be entitled to receive such Severance Benefits if the Participant can demonstrate that such termination by the Company or event constituting Good Reason (A) occurred at the specific request of a third party with which the Company had entered into negotiations or an agreement regarding a subsequent Change in Control or (B) otherwise occurred in connection with (or in anticipation of) such Change in Control. The termination of a Participant’s employment that entitles the Participant to Severance Benefits pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) is referred to in this Plan as a “Pre-Change in Control Qualifying Termination.” A “Pre-Change in Control Qualifying Termination” will not include a termination of a Participant’s employment by reason of death or Disability, the Company’s termination of a Participant’s employment for Cause or a Participant’s voluntary termination without Good Reason. 

^^^ \centered (c) Any Unpaid Compensation will be paid in cash to a Participant in a single lump sum within 30 days after the date of the Qualifying Termination of such Participant. 

^^ \centered 3.2 Severance Benefits for Tier 1 Participants and Tier 2 Participants. In the event the Company is obligated to provide Severance Benefits to any Participant pursuant to Section 3.1, such Participant will receive the following with payment as provided in this Section 3 unless the Participant has validly and effectively elected deferral of any such payment or award under another plan (in which case the payment or award would be made under the terms of the other plan): 

^^^ \centered (a) The cash amount such Participant would receive under the Annual Incentive Plan in effect for the fiscal year in which such Participant’s Qualifying Termination occurs. If such Qualifying Termination occurs within the first three quarters of any fiscal year, such cash amount will be determined based on the assumption that the Target Level of performance under such Annual Incentive Plan had been achieved. If the Qualifying Termination occurs in the fourth quarter of any fiscal year, such cash amount will be determined based on projected actual performance (unless Target Level performance would result in a larger cash payment, in which event the amount of the cash payment will be determined based on the assumption that Target Level performance had been achieved). In each case, the cash amount will be adjusted on a pro rata basis to reflect the number of days the Participant was actually employed during such fiscal year. 

^^^ \centered (b) The cash amount such Participant would receive under any Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan in effect at the time such Participant’s Qualifying Termination occurs,     


^^^ \centered assuming the Target Level of performance under such Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan had been achieved. 

^^^ \centered (c) Any Stock Awards of the Participant (other than Performance Vesting Stock Awards) will become immediately vested and payable in full in the form of stock on the date of a Qualifying Termination of the Participant and will be paid, distributed or transferred to the Participant in accordance with their terms. 

^^^ \centered (d) Any Performance Vesting Stock Awards of the Participant will become immediately vested and payable in the form of stock on the date of a Qualifying Termination of such Participant, assuming the Target Level of performance under such Performance Vesting Stock Award had been achieved and will be paid, distributed or transferred to the Participant in accordance with their terms. 

^^^ \centered (e) A cash amount, determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, with a value equal to any Perquisites that would have been provided to the Participant for a period of one year following the Qualifying Termination of such Participant. 

^^ \centered 3.3 Severance Benefits for Tier 1 Participants. In the event the Company is obligated to provide Severance Benefits to any Tier 1 Participant pursuant to Section 3.1, such Tier 1 Participant will receive (in addition to the Severance Benefits described in Section 3.2) the following: 

^^^ \centered (a) A cash amount equal to the sum of: (i) three times the Tier 1 Participant’s Annual Base Salary in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination, plus (ii) three times the Tier 1 Participant’s then current bonus opportunity established under any Annual Incentive Plan, assuming the Target Level of performance under such Annual Incentive Plan had been achieved. 

^^^ \centered (b) A cash amount equal to three times the maximum match (determined on an annual basis) the Tier 1 Participant would have received under any Qualified 401(k) Plan for the calendar year in which such Tier 1 Participant’s Qualifying Termination occurs, assuming such Tier 1 Participant had (i) earned “recognized compensation” during such calendar year equal to or greater than the maximum dollar amount permitted under the Code and (ii) deferred into the Qualified 401(k) Plan such maximum dollar amount for the calendar year. 

^^^ \centered (c) A cash amount, determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, with a value equal to the benefits that would have been provided to the Participant for a period of three years after the date of such Participant’s Qualifying Termination under the Group Health Plan. 

^^^ \centered (d) An additional supplemental retirement benefit equal to the increase to the Tier 1 Participant’s benefit under any SERP that would have occurred if the amount of such Tier 1 Participant’s benefit payable under the SERP was determined based on the assumption that the Tier 1 Participant had been continuously employed by the Company for the three-year period following the date of such Tier 1 Participant’s Qualifying Termination (with respect to both the Tier 1 Participant’s age and years of service);     


^^^ \centered provided, however, that neither the time nor the form of payment of such Tier 1 Participant’s benefit under the SERP will be affected by such additional age and service credit, and such supplemental retirement benefit will be paid at the time and in the form the benefit under the SERP is paid. In determining the amount of such additional supplemental retirement benefit, a Tier 1 Participant’s “recognized compensation” will be deemed to include his or her Annual Base Salary and any payments received by the Tier 1 Participant pursuant to any Annual Incentive Plan during the year preceding his or her Qualifying Termination. 

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) - (d) of this Section 3.3, the multiplier or period of years used to determine the benefits in each such subsection (i.e., three) shall be reduced two tenths (0.2) effective on each of the fifth through ninth anniversaries of the date the Tier 1 Participant was appointed to his or her then-current position, provided that the Tier 1 Participant has not experienced a Qualifying Termination prior to any such anniversary, so that the multiplier or period of years shall be two effective on the ninth such anniversary. If a Tier 1 Participant is appointed to a new position in which he or she remains or again becomes a Tier 1 Participant, the multiplier or period of years under subsections (a)  (d) shall be restored to three, subject to the future application of this subsection (e) based on the anniversaries of the Tier 1 Participant’s appointment to his or her new position.

^^ \centered 3.4 Severance Benefits for Tier 2 Participants. In the event the Company is obligated to provide Severance Benefits to any Tier 2 Participant pursuant to Section 3.1, such Tier 2 Participant will receive (in addition to the Severance Benefits described in Section 3.2) the following: 

^^^ \centered (a) A cash amount equal to the sum of: (i) two times the Tier 2 Participant’s Annual Base Salary in effect on the date of his or her Qualifying Termination, plus (ii) two times the Tier 2 Participant’s then current bonus opportunity established under any Annual Incentive Plan, assuming the Target Level of performance under such Annual Incentive Plan had been achieved. 

^^^ \centered (b) A cash amount equal to two times the maximum match (determined on an annual basis) the Tier 2 Participant could have received under any Qualified 401(k) Plan for the calendar year in which such Tier 2 Participant’s Qualifying Termination occurs, assuming such Tier 2 Participant had (i) earned “recognized compensation” during such calendar year equal to or greater than the maximum dollar amount permitted under the Code and (ii) deferred into the Qualified 401(k) Plan such maximum dollar amount for the calendar year. 

^^^ \centered (c) A cash amount, determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, with a value equal to the benefits that would have been provided to the Participant for a period of two years after the date of such Participant’s Qualifying Termination under the Group Health Plan. 

^^^ \centered (d) An additional supplemental retirement benefit equal to the increase to the Tier 2 Participant’s benefit under any SERP that would have occurred if the amount of     


^^^ \centered such Tier 2 Participant’s benefit payable under the SERP was determined based on the assumption that the Tier 2 Participant had been continuously employed by the Company for the two-year period following the date of such Tier 2 Participant’s Qualifying Termination (with respect to both the Tier 2 Participant’s age and years of service); provided, however, that neither the time nor the form of payment of such Tier 2 Participant’s benefit under the SERP will be affected by such additional age and service credit, and such supplemental retirement benefit will be paid at the time and in the form the benefit under the SERP is paid. In determining the amount of such additional supplemental retirement benefit, a Tier 2 Participant’s “recognized compensation” will be deemed to include his or her Annual Base Salary and any payments received by the Tier 2 Participant pursuant to any Annual Incentive Plan during the year preceding his or her Qualifying Termination. 

^^ \centered 3.5 Termination Due to Disability or Death. Following a Change in Control, if a Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated due to Disability or death, the Company will pay any Unpaid Compensation through the date of such termination to the Participant or his or her designated beneficiaries (or, if there are no such designated beneficiaries, to the Participant’s estate), respectively. The payment of any other amounts or benefits to the Participant or his or her beneficiaries or estate will be determined in accordance with any Annual Incentive Plan, Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan, Equity Incentive Plan, the Company’s retirement, disability, insurance and survivors’ benefits plans and programs and other applicable plans and programs of the Company then in effect. 

^^ \centered 3.6 Termination for Cause or by the Participant Without Good Reason. Following a Change in Control, if a Participant’s employment with the Company is terminated either by the Company for Cause or voluntarily by such Participant without Good Reason, the Company will pay the Participant (a) any Unpaid Compensation through the date of such termination, plus (b) all other amounts to which the Participant is entitled under any compensation plans of the Company, at the time such payments are due. The Company will have no further obligations to such Participant under this Plan. 

^^ \centered 3.7 Notice of Termination. Any termination of a Participant’s employment by the Company for Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason will be communicated by Notice of Termination to such Participant or the Committee, as the case may be. 

^^ \centered 3.8 Payment of Severance Benefits. The Severance Benefits described in Sections 3.2(a), (b) and (e), Sections 3.3(a), (b) and (c) and Sections 3.4(a), (b) and (c) will be paid in cash to a Participant in a single lump sum not later than the 15th day of the third calendar month following the date of the Qualifying Termination of such Participant (or, if such Participant dies before payment is made, to the Participant’s designated beneficiaries or estate not later than the 15th day of the third calendar month after the date of such Participant’s Qualifying Termination); provided, however, that no payment shall be made, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any Severance Benefits, unless the Participant has executed and not revoked the Settlement Agreement and General Release of Claims described in Section 4.1, and the period for such revocation has expired, before such payment is made or would otherwise be required.    


^ \centered SECTION 4. RELEASE AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS 

^^ \centered 4.1 Release. The Severance Benefits are in consideration of a Participant’s release of all claims against the Company pursuant to an agreement with terms substantially similar to the terms of the Separation Agreement and General Release of Claims set forth as Exhibit A to this Plan (the “Release”). If a Participant does not execute the Release or if he or she effectively revokes it, the Participant will not be entitled to any Severance Benefits. 

^^ \centered 4.2 Restrictive Covenants. The Company’s obligation to provide the Severance Benefits to a Participant will be conditioned on the Participant’s continuing compliance with the confidentiality and non-disparagement, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants set forth in the Release.

^ \centered SECTION 5. TRUST 

^^ \centered 5.1 Establishment of Trust. At any time but in no event later than the date of a Change in Control, the Company will establish a trust fund (the “Trust”) for the benefit of the Participants to secure the Severance Benefits to be provided under this Plan. The Company will fund the Trust with cash or with a letter of credit not later than such date of the Change in Control, or such earlier date if authorized by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations owed by the Company under this Plan are unfunded and unsecured liabilities of the Company. In the event of the Company’s insolvency or bankruptcy, the assets of the Trust will be treated like other corporate assets of the Company and will be subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. Claims for benefits under this Plan will be treated like any other claim by the Company’s unsecured creditors, with no special preference for Participants. 

^^ \centered 5.2 Trust Assets. Interest earned on amounts deposited by the Company into the Trust will be for the account of the Company, and, after payment of all cash Severance Benefits to the Participants under this Plan, any surplus amount held in the Trust will be retained by the Company. In the event any Participant who is eligible for Severance Benefits becomes subject to Taxes on the full amount held in the Trust for such Participant’s benefit, the Company will directly pay any such taxes due from the Trust. 

^ \centered SECTION 6. EXCISE TAXES 

^^^ \centered 6.1 Limitation for Excess Parachute Payments. 

^^^ \centered (a) In the event a Participant becomes entitled to receive payments of Severance Benefits under the Plan, the Company will cause an independent accounting or other qualified firm (the “Tax Advisor”) promptly to review, at the Company’s sole expense, the applicability of Section 4999 of the Code to those payments. The Tax Advisor will determine whether the payment of Severance Benefits or any other amounts by the Company to a Participant or for a Participant’s benefit (whether paid or payable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise) (the “Total Payments”), would be subject     

^^^ \centered to the excise Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, and any interest or penalties with respect to such excise Tax (the excise Tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are collectively referred to herein as the “Excise Tax”). 

^^^ \centered (b) If the Tax Advisor determines that Total Payments to any Participant would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the aggregate present value of Severance Benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the aggregate present value of the Total Payments (determined in each case pursuant to Section 280G of the Code and applicable regulations promulgated thereunder) does not exceed the greatest amount that could be paid to the Participant such that the receipt of payments under this Plan would not give rise to any Excise Tax. In the event that a cutback described in this Section 6.1(b) is required, amounts payable to the Participant in cash shall be reduced first, followed by a reduction of other benefits, as determined by the Tax Advisor. The Tax Advisor shall make a final determination as to whether a reduction in the aggregate present value of the Total Payments to the Participant is required pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) not later than the latest date provided in Section 3.8 of this Plan for payment of Severance Benefits. 

^^^ \centered (c) A Participant will in good faith cooperate with the Tax Advisor in making the determination of whether a reduction to Severance Benefits is required (including, without limitation, providing the Tax Advisor with information or documentation as reasonably requested by the Tax Advisor). 

^^^ \centered (d) Any determination by the Tax Advisor regarding whether a reduction to Severance Benefits is required will be conclusive and binding upon the Participant and the Company for all purposes. 

^ \centered SECTION 7. CLAIMS PROCEDURE 

^^ \centered 7.1 Original Claim. Any Participant, former Participant, or beneficiary of such Participant or former Participant, if he or she so desires, may file with the Committee a written claim for Severance Benefits under this Plan.

^^General Rules. The following general rules will apply to all claims for Severance Benefits:

^^^ \centered (a) No inquiry or question from a Participant regarding Severance Benefits will be deemed to be a claim or request for review of a denied claim, unless made in accordance with the procedures described in Section 7.1. The Committee may require that any claim for benefits be filed on forms to be furnished to the claimant upon request; 

^^^ \centered (b) All decisions on claims and requests for review of denied claims will be made by the Committee;

^^^ \centered (e) The decision of the Committee on a claim or request for review of a denied claim will be provided to the claimant in writing. If a decision or notice is not received by a claimant within the time specified, the claim or request for a review of a denied claim will be deemed to have been denied; and 

^^^ \centered (f) Prior to filing a claim or request for review of a denied claim, the claimant or his or her lawyer or other representative will have a reasonable opportunity to review a copy of this Plan and all other pertinent documents in the possession of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company will have no obligation to make any payment to any Participant under this Plan to the extent (but only to the extent) that such payment is prohibited by the terms of any final order of a federal or state court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction. Such

^^^ \centered (b) A Participant will not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the Severance Benefits the Company is required to provide under this Plan, and the obtaining of any such other employment will in no event effect any reduction of the Company’s obligations to provide Severance Benefits under this Plan.

The Company will require any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, reorganization, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation or otherwise) to expressly assume and agree to perform this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. Regardless of whether such an agreement to such express assumption is obtained, this Plan will be binding upon any successor in accordance with the operation of law, and such successor will be deemed to be the “Company” for purposes of this Plan. 

^^ \centered 9.2 Assignment by the Participant. This Plan will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant’s personal or legal representatives or designated beneficiaries. If the Participant dies while any amount would still be payable to such Participant had he or she continued to live, all such amounts will be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to such Participant’s designated (or, if there are no such designated beneficiaries, to the Participant’s estate).

^^^ \centered (b) This Plan completely supersedes any and all prior change in control severance agreements, understandings or plans (including, without limitation, the Income Security Plan, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date), oral or written, entered into between the Company and a Participant. 

^^ \centered 10.4 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications hereunder will be sufficient if in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand or if sent by registered or certified mail to the Participant at the last address he or she has filed in writing with the Company, or, in the case of the Company, at its principal executive offices.

WHEREAS, ATK has expended significant time and resources on technology, research, and development through which it has developed products, processes, technologies and services that are valuable, special and unique assets of ATK’s business, which [employee name] acknowledges constitute confidential, proprietary and trade secret information belonging to ATK.

WHEREAS, the disclosure to or use by third parties of any of ATK’s confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information, or [employee name]’s unauthorized use of such information, would seriously harm ATK’s business and cause monetary loss that would be difficult, if not impossible, to measure.
