Ladies and Gentlemen:  

[[Organization 1 Name]], LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule A annexed hereto (the “Underwriters”), for whom [[Organization 2 Name]], [[Organization 3 Name]] and [[Organization 4 Name]] [[Representatives]] are acting as representatives (the “Representatives”), an aggregate of 4,000,000 common units (the “Firm Units”) representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the “Common Units”). In addition, the Partnership proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 Common Units (the “Additional Units”), solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments. The Firm Units and the Additional Units are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Units.” The Units are described in the Prospectus, which is referred to below. 

This agreement (the “Agreement”) is to confirm the agreement among the Partnership, Western Gas Holdings, a Delaware limited liability company (the “General Partner”), Western Gas Operating, a Delaware limited liability company (“Operating GP”), and [[Organization 5 Name]], a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership,” and together with the Partnership, the General Partner and the Operating GP, the “Western Gas Parties”), on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, concerning the purchase of the Units from the Partnership by the Underwriters. 

The Western Gas Parties and the Underwriters agree as follows: 

^Sale and Purchase. Upon the basis of the representations and warranties and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the respective Underwriters, the General Partner agrees to cause the Partnership to issue and sell to the respective Underwriters and each of the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Partnership, the number of Firm Units set forth opposite the name of such 

^^^^^ 
Underwriter in Schedule A attached hereto, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 8 hereof, in each case at a purchase price of $21.35 per Unit. 

In addition, upon the basis of the representations and warranties and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in the event that the Underwriters sell more Common Units in the Offering than the number of Firm Units, the Partnership hereby grants to the several Underwriters the option (the “Over-Allotment Option”) to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Partnership, ratably in accordance with the number of Firm Units to be purchased by each of them, all or a portion of the Additional Units at the same purchase price per Unit to be paid by the Underwriters to the Partnership for the Firm Units. The Over-Allotment Option may be exercised by the Representatives on behalf of the several Underwriters at any time and from time to time on or before the thirtieth day following the date of the Prospectus, by written notice to the Partnership. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Additional Units as to which the Over-Allotment Option is being exercised and the date and time when the Additional Units are to be delivered (any such date and time being referred to herein as an “additional time of purchase”); provided, however, that no additional time of purchase shall be earlier than the time of purchase (as defined in Section 2 hereof) nor, if the additional time of purchase is after the time of purchase, earlier than the second business day after the date on which the Over-Allotment Option shall have been exercised nor later than the tenth business day after the date on which the Over-Allotment Option shall have been exercised. The number of Additional Units to be sold to each Underwriter shall be the number that bears the same proportion to the aggregate number of Additional Units being purchased as the number of Firm Units set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule A attached hereto bears to the aggregate number of Firm Units, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives may determine are necessary to eliminate fractional Units and subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 8 hereof. 

^Payment and Delivery. Payment of the purchase price for the Firm Units shall be made to the Partnership by Federal Funds wire transfer against electronic delivery of the Firm Units in book-entry form to the Representatives through the facilities of [[Organization 6 Name]] (“DTC”) for the respective accounts of the Underwriters. Such payment and delivery shall be made at 9:00 A.M., Houston, Texas time, on [[Date 2: Date]] (the “Closing Date”) (unless another time shall be agreed to by the Representatives and the Partnership or unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 hereof). The time at which such payment and delivery are to be made is sometimes referred to herein as the “time of purchase.” Delivery of the Firm Units shall be made in book-entry form through the Full Fast Program of the facilities of [[Organization 6 Name]] (“DTC”) unless the Underwriters shall otherwise instruct. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of the Underwriters. 

Payment of the purchase price for the Additional Units shall be made at the additional time of purchase in the same manner as the payment for the Firm Units. If settlement for the Additional Units occurs after the Closing Date, the Partnership will deliver to the Underwriters on the settlement date for the Additional Units, and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Additional Units shall be conditioned upon receipt of, supplemental opinions, certificates and letters confirming as of such date the opinions, certificates and letters delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 6 hereof.

^^FINRA shall not have raised any objection that has not been resolved with respect to the fairness or reasonableness of the underwriting, or other arrangements of the transactions, contemplated hereby.

^Effective Date of Agreement; Termination. This Agreement shall become effective when the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement. 

The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, if (a) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, there has been any change, or any developments that are reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse change, in the business, assets, management, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or results of operations of any Partnership Entity, the effect of which change or development on the Partnership Entities, taken as a whole, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the Offering or the delivery of the Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, (b) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE or the NASDAQ; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Partnership’s securities on the NYSE; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v), in the sole judgment of the Representatives, makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the Offering or the 

^^^^^ 
delivery of the Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or (c) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any downgrading in, or any notice or announcement shall have been given or made of (i) any intended or potential downgrading or (ii) any watch, review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating accorded to, any securities of or guaranteed by any Partnership Entity by any “nationally recognized statistical rating organization,” as that term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act. 

If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, the Partnership and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly in writing. 

If the sale to the Underwriters of the Units, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement, or if such sale is not carried out because the Partnership Entities shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Western Gas Parties shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(p), and hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Western Gas Parties under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder. 

^Increase in Underwriters’ Commitments. Subject to Sections 6 and hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Firm Units to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6 hereof or a reason sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the number of Firm Units that all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of the total number of Firm Units, the non-defaulting Underwriters (including the Underwriters, if any, substituted in the manner set forth below) shall take up and pay for (in addition to the aggregate number of Firm Units they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the number of Firm Units agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Units shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriters in such amount or amounts as the Representatives may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such designation is made, such Units shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of Firm Units set forth opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule A. 

Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter of its obligations hereunder, the Partnership agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Firm Units hereunder unless all of the Firm Units are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by the Representatives with the approval of the Partnership or selected by the Partnership with the approval of the Representatives). 

If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Partnership for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Partnership or the Representatives shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected. 

^^^^^ 
The term “Underwriter” as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Schedule A hereto. 

If the aggregate number of Firm Units that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds [[Percentage 9]]% of the total number of Firm Units, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Partnership shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Firm Units that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Partnership to any Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Partnership. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. 

^Indemnity and Contribution.  

^^Each of the Western Gas Parties, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors, officers and affiliates, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or any such person may incur under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Partnership) or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with the information specified in Section 10 hereof furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Partnership expressly for use in, the Registration Statement or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any “issuer information” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) of the Partnership or in any Prospectus together with any combination of one or more Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, with respect to such Preliminary Prospectus, Pricing Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with the information specified in Section 10 hereof furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the 

^^^^^ 
Representatives to the Partnership expressly for use in, such Preliminary Prospectus, Pricing Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Preliminary Prospectus, Pricing Disclosure Package, Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any “road show” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) not constituting an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus. 

^^Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Western Gas Parties, their directors and officers, and any person who controls the Western Gas Parties within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Western Gas Parties or any such person may incur under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with the information specified in Section 10 hereof furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Partnership expressly for use in, the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Partnership), or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with the information specified in Section 10 hereof furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Partnership expressly for use in, a Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

^^If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a “Proceeding”) is brought against a person (an “indemnified party”) in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any of the Western Gas Parties or an Underwriter (as applicable, the “indemnifying party”) pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that the failure to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been 

^^^^^ 
authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that, except as provided in Section 9(b), such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days’ prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party. 

^^If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Western Gas Parties on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the Offering or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Western Gas Parties on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Western Gas Parties on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the Offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Western Gas Parties, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Units. The relative fault of the 

^^^^^ 
Western Gas Parties on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Western Gas Parties or by the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding. 

^^The Western Gas Parties and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Units underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint. 

^^The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Western Gas Parties contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Western Gas Parties, their directors or officers or any person who controls the Western Gas Parties within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Units.

The section headings in this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience of reference and are not a part of this Agreement. 

^Submission to Jurisdiction. Except as set forth below, no Claim may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which courts shall have jurisdiction over the adjudication of such matters, and the Western Gas Parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto. The Western Gas Parties hereby consent to personal jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any Claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by any third party against any Underwriter or any indemnified party.

Each of the Western Gas Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Western Gas Parties and may be enforced in any other courts to the jurisdiction of which the Western Gas Parties are or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment. 

^Parties at Interest. The Agreement set forth herein has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Western Gas Parties and to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof the controlling persons, partners, directors and officers referred to in such Section, and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, personal representatives and executors and administrators.

The Western Gas Parties further acknowledge that the Underwriters are acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm’s length basis, and in no event do the parties intend that the Underwriters act or be 

^^^^^ 
responsible as a fiduciary to the Partnership Entities, their management, security holders or creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Underwriters may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Units, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriters hereby expressly disclaim any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Partnership Entities, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters relating to such transactions, and each Western Gas Party hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Western Gas Parties and the Underwriters agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriters to the Partnership Entities regarding such transactions, including, but not limited to, any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Partnership’s securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Partnership Entities. Each Partnership Entity hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that it may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Partnership Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters relating to such transactions.

^Miscellaneous. UBS, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of [[Organization 17 Name]], is not a bank and is separate from any affiliated bank, including any U.S. branch or agency of [[Organization 17 Name]].

Securities sold, offered or recommended by UBS are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency, and are not otherwise an obligation or responsibility of a branch or agency.

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

This Lock-Up Agreement is being delivered to you in connection with the proposed Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) to be entered into by Western Gas Holdings, a Delaware limited liability company, [[Organization 1 Name]], LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), Western Gas Operating, a Delaware limited liability company, and [[Organization 5 Name]], a Delaware limited partnership, and each of you as representatives of a group of Underwriters named therein, relating to an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the “Common Units”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement. 

In consideration of the execution of the Underwriting Agreement by you, and for other good and valuable consideration, the undersigned hereby irrevocably agrees that the undersigned will not, directly or indirectly, (i) offer for sale, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any Common Units or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for Common Units, or sell or grant options, rights or warrants with respect to any Common Units or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units, in each case owned by the undersigned on the date of execution of this Lock-Up Agreement or on the date of the completion of the Offering, or (ii) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such Common Units, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, in each case for a period of 60 days from the date of the Prospectus (the “Lock-Up Period”) without the prior written consent of [[Organization 2 Name]]; provided, however, that with respect to the undersigned, the foregoing restrictions do not apply to (a) the registration of the issuance and sale of the Common Units as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the sale of the Common Units to the Underwriters in the Offering, (b) bona fide gifts, provided the recipient thereof agrees in writing with the Underwriters to be bound by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement, (c) dispositions to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned and/or the immediate family of the undersigned, provided that such trust agrees in writing with the Underwriters to be bound by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement or (d) as required or permitted by the Partnership’s benefit

^^^^^ 
plans to reimburse or pay income tax in connection with the vesting of options, rights or warrants. For purposes of this paragraph, “immediate family” shall mean the undersigned and the spouse, any lineal descendent, father, mother, brother or sister of the undersigned. 

In addition, the undersigned hereby waives any rights the undersigned may have to require registration of Common Units in connection with the filing of a registration statement relating to the Offering. The undersigned further agrees that, for the Lock-Up Period, the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of [[Organization 2 Name]], make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of Common Units or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Units, or warrants or other rights to purchase Common Units or any such securities. 

In addition, the undersigned hereby waives any and all preemptive rights, participation rights, resale rights, rights of first refusal and similar rights that the undersigned may have in connection with the Offering or with any issuance or sale by the Partnership of any equity or other securities before the Offering, except for any such rights as have been heretofore duly exercised. 

The undersigned hereby confirms that the undersigned has not, directly or indirectly, taken, and hereby covenants that the undersigned will not, directly or indirectly, take any action designed, or which has constituted or will constitute or might reasonably be expected, to cause or result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Partnership to facilitate the sale or resale of the Common Units. 

\centered * * * 

If (i) the Partnership notifies you in writing that it does not intend to proceed with the Offering, (ii) the registration statement filed with the Commission with respect to the Offering is withdrawn or (iii) for any reason the Underwriting Agreement shall be terminated prior to the “time of purchase” (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement), this Lock-Up Agreement shall be terminated and the undersigned shall be released from its obligations hereunder.
