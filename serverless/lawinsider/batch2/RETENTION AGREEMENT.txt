^^^Severance Payment. Executive shall be entitled to severance payments equal to six (6) months worth of the Executive’s then-current annual base salary (commencing as of the Date of Termination), which payments shall be paid in accordance with the Corporation’s normal payroll procedures, except that any payments that would otherwise have been made before the first normal payroll payment date falling on or after the date on which the Release becomes irrevocable (the “First Payment Date”) shall be made on the First Payment Date.

^^Covered Termination Within Twelve Months After a Change in Control. If Executive’s employment with the Corporation is terminated due to a Covered Termination which occurs within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control, and Executive executes and does not revoke a Release as described in Section 3(d) below, then Executive shall be entitled to the following severance benefits: 

^^^Acceleration of Equity Awards. The vested portion of each option to purchase the Corporation’s capital stock, restricted share award or other equity award with regard to the Corporations’ capital stock that Executive then holds shall be determined by adding an additional six (6) months to the Executive’s actual period of service with the Corporation.

As a condition to Executive’s receipt of any benefits described in this Section 3 (other than in Section 3(a)), Executive shall be required to execute a Release within fifty (50) days following the Date of Termination and not revoke such Release within any period permitted under applicable law. Such Release shall specifically relate to all of Executive’s rights and claims in existence at the time of such execution but shall exclude any continuing obligations the Corporation may have to Executive following the date of termination under this Agreement or any other agreement providing for obligations to survive Executive’s termination of employment. 

^Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if Executive is deemed by the Corporation at the time of his Separation from Service to be a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executive’s benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (a) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executive’s Separation from Service or (b) the date of Executive’s death. Upon the first business day following the expiration of the applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 4 shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive, and any remaining payments due under the Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executive’s right to receive any installment payments payable hereunder shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. 

^Excise Tax Limitation. 

^^Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the benefits provided by this Agreement, together with all other payments and the value of any benefits received or to be received by Executive (“Payments”), constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and, but for this Section 5, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then the Payments shall be made to Executive either (i) in full or (ii) as to such lesser amount as would result in no portion of the Payments being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax. Unless Executive shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Corporation to effectuate any reduction contemplated by the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall reduce or eliminate the Payments by first reducing or eliminating cash payments and then by reducing those payments or benefits which are not payable in cash, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the Determination (as hereinafter defined). Any notice given by Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing Executive’s rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation. 

^^Unless the Corporation and Executive otherwise agree in writing, an initial determination as to whether the Payments shall be reduced and the amount of such reduction shall be made, at the Corporation’s expense, by the accounting firm that is the Corporation’s independent accounting firm as of the date of the Change in Control (the “Accounting Firm”). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the “Determination”), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation, to the Corporation and Executive within twenty (20) days of the Date of Termination if applicable, or such other time as requested by the Corporation or by Executive (provided Executive reasonably believes that Executive will receive Payments which may be subject to the Excise Tax), and if the Accounting Firm determines that there is substantial authority (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code) that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such Payment or Payments. Within ten (10) days of the delivery of the Determination to Executive, Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination (the “Dispute”). If there is no Dispute, the Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Corporation and Executive. 

^^As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is possible that the Payments to be made to, or provided for the benefit of, Executive either will be greater (an “Excess Payment”) or less (an “Underpayment”) than the amounts provided for by the limitation contained in Section 5(a). 

^^^If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) proceeding which has been finally and conclusively resolved that an Excess Payment has been made, such Excess Payment shall be deemed for all purposes to be a loan to Executive made on the date Executive received the Excess Payment and Executive shall repay the Excess Payment to the Corporation on demand (but not less than ten (10) days after written notice is received by Executive) together with interest on the Excess Payment at the “Applicable Federal Rate” (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of Executive’s receipt of such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment. 

^^^In the event that it is determined by (A) the Accounting Firm, the Corporation (which shall include the position taken by the Corporation, or together with its consolidated group, on its federal income tax return) or the IRS, (B) pursuant to a determination by a court, or (C) upon the resolution to Executive’s satisfaction of the Dispute that an Underpayment has occurred, the Corporation shall pay an amount equal to the Underpayment to Executive within ten (10) days of such determination or resolution, together with interest on such amount at the Applicable Federal Rate from the date such amount would have been paid to Executive until the date of payment. 

^Successors; Binding Agreement. 

^^The Corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Unless expressly provided otherwise, “Corporation” as used herein shall mean the Corporation as defined in this Agreement and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid. 

^^This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive and Executive’s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If Executive should die while any amount would still be payable to Executive hereunder had Executive continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Executive’s devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to Executive’s estate. 

^Miscellaneous. 

^^Modification or Amendment. No provision of this Agreement may be modified or amended unless such modification or amendment is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and an authorized officer of the Corporation as may be specifically designated by the Board or a committee thereof. 

^^Waiver. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. 

^^Non-Exclusivity of Rights. Notwithstanding Section 7(c), nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive’s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the Corporation (except for any severance or termination policies, plans, programs or practices) and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or reduce such rights as Executive may have under any other agreements with the Corporation (except for any severance, termination or other agreement regarding the subject matter of this Agreement). Amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Corporation shall be payable in accordance with such plan or program, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement. 

^^Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law principles. 

^^Statutory References. All references to sections of the Exchange Act or the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to such sections. 

^^Tax Withholding. Any payments provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable withholding required under federal, state or local law. 

^^Section Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. 

^^Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

^^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

^Arbitration. The parties hereby agree that any and all claims or controversies regarding this Agreement shall be resolved, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by final, binding and confidential arbitration in Palo Alto, California conducted before a single arbitrator by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services/Endispute (“JAMS”) or its successor, under the then applicable JAMS rules. By agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both parties waive the right to resolve any such dispute through a trial by jury or judge or by administrative proceeding. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision including the arbitrator’s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The Corporation shall pay all of JAMS’ arbitration fees. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from obtaining injunctive relief in court if necessary to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any arbitration. 

^Fees and Expenses. In connection with a Covered Termination which occurs within twelve (12) months after a Change in Control, the Corporation shall pay all reasonable legal fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts, evidence and counsel) incurred by Executive as they become due as a result of (a) Executive seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any such fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Dispute whether as a result of any applicable government taxing authority proceeding, audit or otherwise), and (b) Executive’s hearing before the Board as contemplated in Section I(b) of this Agreement. To the extent that any reimbursements payable to Executive pursuant to this Section 9 are subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, such reimbursements shall be paid to Executive no later than [[Date 2: Date]] of the year following the year in which the cost was incurred, the amount of expenses reimbursed in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent year, and Executive’s right to reimbursement under this Section 9 will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

^Settlement of Claims. The Corporation’s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Corporation may have against Executive or others. 

^At-Will Employment. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (a) confer upon Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Corporation, (b) constitute any contract or agreement of employment, or (c) interfere in any way with the at-will nature of Executive’s employment with the Corporation. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
