WHEREAS, on [[Date 2: Date]], Participant was granted a potential award of performance shares by the Committee and the Board of Directors as set forth in a Form 8-K dated [[Date 2]]. The Participant and the Company now wish to memorialize the award pursuant to this Performance Share Agreement.

WHEREAS, the Company maintains the [[Company]] 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which is incorporated into and forms a part of this Agreement (all capitalized terms not defined herein have the definitions set forth in the Plan), and the Participant has been selected by the Committee to receive a performance share award, which shall constitute an award of Restricted Stock Units, under the Plan. The Company has allocated such Restricted Stock Units to the Participant from the Plan since 2009;

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED, by and between the Company and the Participant, as follows:

^**Performance Period**. The “Performance Period” is the period beginning on [[Date 3: Date]], and ending on [[Date 4: Date]], with each year from [[Date 5: Date]] to [[Date 6: Date]] during the Performance Period being a “Performance Year”.

^**Award**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, effective [[Date 2]], the Participant was granted the opportunity to earn up to [[Shares 1: Number]] shares (each share so earned, a “Performance Share”) of the Common Stock of the Company, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

^**Settlement of Awards**. The number of Performance Shares earned by the Participant shall equal the sum of the 3-year Relative Revenue Growth and the 3-year EBITDA Relative Growth as set forth in Appendix A as compared to an index of the following peer companies as amended by the Committee from time-to-time:

[[Organization 1 Name]] Exclusive Synthesis 
[[Organization 2 Name]] Limited

[[Organization 3 Name]] 
[[Organization 4 Name]] 
[[Organization 5 Name]] 
[[Organization 6 Name]] 
WuXi [[Organization 7 Name]] 
[[Organization 8 Name]] 

If, during the Performance Period, a company in the peer group is acquired or becomes no longer publicly traded, then that company shall be removed from the peer group and shall not be factored into the performance calculation. If more than three companies are removed from the peer group, the Committee shall approve additional companies to be added to the peer group to maintain a broad comparator group.

^**Vesting**.

^^The Participant’s right to the Performance Shares shall vest on the first to occur (the date of the first to occur, the “Vesting Date”) of (i) [[Date 4]], if the Participant remains employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates (as defined below) on such day, (ii) a Change in Control during the Performance Period, if the Participant remains employed by the Company and its Affiliates on the date of such Change in Control, (iii) a termination of the Participant’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates during the Performance Period due to the Participant’s death or Disability (as defined below) or (iv) the Company terminates the Participant’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates during the Performance Period witho ut Cause (as defined below); provided, however, that in the event that (x) a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period or (y) the Participant’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates during the Performance Period due to the Participant’s death or Disability or (z) the Participant’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates is terminated by the Company without Cause during the Performance Period, the Participant’s vesting shall be in the right to receive a prorated award of Performance Shares in accordance with Section 4(c).
