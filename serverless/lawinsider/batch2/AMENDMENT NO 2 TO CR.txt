““**Follow On Equity Offering**” means a public offering of common stock of Holdings that is consummated on or prior to [[Date 3: Date]].

The gross proceeds of the Follow On Equity Offering shall be used, upon the consummation of the Follow On Equity Offering, (x) to voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement at a prepayment price not to exceed the price set forth in subsection 2.4B(ii) thereof as such provision is in effect on the Second Amendment Effective Date (the “**Follow On Second Lien Prepayment**”) and (y) to the extent that the gross proceeds of the Follow On Equity Offering remain after the prepayment referred to in immediately preceding clause (y), first, to pay for the fees and expenses relating thereto and second, for general corporate purposes, including permitted Investments.

^^A third sentence shall be added to subsection 7.10(B) of the Credit Agreement, which shall read as follows:

“Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing shall not prevent the making of the Follow On Second Lien Prepayment.”

Section 2. Conditions Precedent to the Effectiveness of this Amendment

On and as of the Second Amendment Effective Date, after giving effect to this Second Amendment, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender as follows:

^^the representations and warranties contained in the Credit Agreement and in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Second Amendment Effective Date to the same extent as though made on and as of that date, except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such earlier date;

^^no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Credit Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Agreement; and

^^Except as specifically amended above, all of the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents are and shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.

^^The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Lenders, Holdings, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents, nor constitute a waiver of any other provision of any of the Loan Documents or for any purpose.

^^Each of the Loan Documents, including the Credit Agreement, and any and all other agreements, documents or instruments now or hereafter executed and/or delivered pursuant to the terms hereof or pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement as amended hereby, are hereby amended so that any reference in such Loan Documents to the Credit Agreement, whether direct or indirect, shall mean a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.
