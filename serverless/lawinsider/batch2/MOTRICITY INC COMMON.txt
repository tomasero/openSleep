\centered COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT 

Warrant No. [ ]      [ ] Shares

This certifies that, for the agreed upon value of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and for other good and valuable consideration, [[Organization 2 Name]], L.P. or its permitted registered assigns (either, the “Registered Holder”), is entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of this Warrant, to purchase from [[Organization 1 Name]], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), at any time after the date of this Warrant and prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below), up to [ ] shares (subject to adjustment as hereinafter set forth) of the common stock, $[[USD Value 3: Number]] par value per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company, at a purchase price of Two Dollars and Five Cents ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]) per share (as adjusted as hereinafter set forth, the “Purchase Price”), upon the terms and conditions set forth below. 

^Exercise of Warrant. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, this Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part, from time to time, at any time after the date hereof but in any event at or prior to 5:00 P.M., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina time, on the Expiration Date but not thereafter, by surrendering this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with a duly executed subscription form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1, together with the payment of the sum obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased by the Purchase Price. In case of any partial exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor for the balance of the shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. Upon receipt of notice of any of the events specified in Paragraphs 6(b), 6(c), 6(d) and 6(e) below, the Registered Holder may elect to exercise the Warrant subject to the occurrence of the event described in such notice by delivering to the Company a duly executed subscription form which shall expressly state that such exercise is contingent upon the occurrence of such event and the Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the date on which such event actually occurs. 

^Effect of Exercise. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date of its surrender for exercise as provided 

above, and the person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of such shares as of the close of business on such date. As soon as practicable on or after such date, the Company shall issue and deliver to the person (or persons) entitled to receive the same a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share equal to such fraction of the Fair Market Value (as defined in Paragraph 10 below) of one whole share of Common Stock as of the date of exercise. No fractional shares may be issued upon any exercise of this Warrant. All shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and the Company shall take any and all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that the par value or stated value, if any, of each share of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant is at all times equal to or less than the then per share Purchase Price. 

^Adjustment of Purchase Price and Number of Shares Purchasable Hereunder. The Purchase Price and the number of shares purchasable hereunder shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with the following provisions: 

^^In case the Company shall at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of its Common Stock, the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the Company shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of its Common Stock, the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased, effective from and after the record date of such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. Upon any adjustment in the Purchase Price pursuant to this Paragraph 3(a), the Registered Holder shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such adjustment by the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the Purchase Price resulting from such adjustment. 

^^In case the Company shall issue additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend on the Common Stock, from and after the day which is the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to such dividend, the Registered Holder shall, until a further adjustment, be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to said record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after the issuance of the dividend, calculated on a fully diluted basis assuming the conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants or other rights (including those with respect to convertible securities), and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to said record date, calculated on a fully diluted basis assuming the conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants, or other rights (including those with respect to convertible securities). Upon each adjustment pursuant to this Paragraph 3(b), the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment shall be reduced to an amount determined by dividing the product obtained by multiplying such Purchase Price by the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately following such adjustment. 

^^In case the Company shall issue, on or after the date of this Warrant, Additional Stock (as such term is defined in Article IV Section (B)(4)(d)(ii) of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, dated December , 2005 (the “Certificate”)), without consideration or for a consideration per share (as determined in accordance with Article IV Sections (B)(4)(d)(i)(C), (D), E(1) and E(2)) of the Certificate) less than the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Stock, the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the Purchase Price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined in Article IV Section (B)(4)(d)(i)(A) of the Certificate) immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration received by the Company for such issuance would purchase at the Purchase Price in effect immediately before such issuance, and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of such Additional Stock. In addition, the Purchase Price shall be readjusted upon the occurrence of the events and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Article IV Sections (B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) and E(4) of the Certificate, provided that the term “Conversion Price of the Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series D1 Preferred Stock” in such provisions shall be replaced with the term “Purchase Price”. Upon any adjustment or readjustment in the Purchase Price pursuant to this Paragraph 3(c), the Registered Holder shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such adjustment by the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the Purchase Price resulting from such adjustment. Except to the limited extent provided for in Article IV Sections (B)(4)(d)(i)(E)(3) and (E)(4) of the Certificate (with the term “Conversion Price of the Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series D1 Preferred Stock” in such provisions being replaced with the term “Purchase Price”), no adjustment of such Purchase Price pursuant to this Paragraph 3(c) shall have the effect of increasing the Purchase Price above the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. 

^Reorganization or Reclassification. If at any time while this Warrant is outstanding there shall be any reorganization or reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Paragraph 3), the Registered Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive, during the term hereof and upon payment of the Purchase Price, the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company resulting from such reorganization or reclassification, as the case may be, to which a holder of the Common Stock of the Company, deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant, would have been entitled upon such reorganization or reclassification if this Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such reorganization or reclassification, and in any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the Registered Holder to the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the adjustment of the Purchase Price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall thereafter be applicable, as near as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. 

^Description of Adjustments. After any adjustment of the Purchase Price or the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant or upon the written request of the Registered Holder, the Company shall deliver to the Registered Holder at the address set forth below a written description setting forth in reasonable detail the Purchase Price and number of shares purchasable hereunder as of the date of such notice and the series of calculations leading to such Purchase Price and number of shares. 

^Expiration Date. The stock purchase rights represented by this Warrant shall terminate on the earliest to occur of the following (the “Expiration Date”): 

^^5:00 P.M., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina time, on [ ]; 

^^the date on which the Company is liquidated or finally dissolved, provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least ten (10) days’ advance written notice of such dissolution or liquidation; 

^^the date on which the Company sells, leases, licenses or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets, provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least ten (10) days’ advance written notice of such sale, lease, license or other disposition; 

^^the date on which the Company merges or consolidates with another entity and the stockholders of the Company own less than fifty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of the equity interests or voting power of the surviving entity or the parent of the surviving entity, provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least ten (10) days’ advance written notice of such merger or consolidation; or 

^^the closing date of the sale and issuance of shares of Common Stock in a firmly underwritten public offering, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), having gross proceeds to the Company or its stockholders of at least $[[USD Value 1: Number]] (a “Public Offering”), provided that the Company has given the Registered Holder at least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of the Company’s intent to engage in a Public Offering and the expected closing date of the Public Offering. 

^Charges, Taxes and Expenses. The issuance of certificates for shares of stock upon any exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Registered Holder for any tax or other expense in respect to the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and, subject to terms and conditions of this Warrant, such certificates shall be issued in the name of, or in such name or names as may be directed by, the Registered Holder; provided, however, that in the event that certificates for shares of stock are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Registered Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by an instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the Registered Holder in person or by an attorney duly authorized in writing and the Registered Holder shall pay all stock transfer taxes payable upon issuance of such stock certificate. 

^Transfer of Warrant. This Warrant may not be transferred except in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws. Any transfer shall require the delivery to the Company of a legal opinion in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided, however that no such opinion shall be required in connection with the grant of participation interests in this Warrant to one or more accredited investors (as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Act) who purchase participation interests in the loan being made to the Company under that certain Master Loan and Security Agreement No. , dated on even date herewith. Any such participant shall provide the Company with a standard investor representation letter in connection with the grant of such participation interest. 

^Market Stand-off Agreement. If so requested by the Company and an underwriter, the Registered Holder agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of this Warrant or any shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to this Warrant (other than those included in the registration) during the one hundred eighty (180) day period following the effective date of a registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided that such agreement shall apply only to the first such registration statement of the Company including equity securities to be sold on its behalf to the public in an underwritten initial public offering and provided that all officers and directors of the Company and all holders of at least one percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities are similarly bound. The obligations described in this Section 9 shall not apply to any registration relating solely to employee benefit plans or Rule 145 transactions. The Company may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of such period. 

^Net Issue Exercise. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of one share of Common Stock is greater than the Purchase Price (at the date of the calculation as set forth below) for that share, in lieu of exercising this Warrant for cash, the Registered Holder of this Warrant may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being canceled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company (or at such other address as the Company may designate) together with notice of such election. In such event, the Company shall issue to the Registered Holder the number of shares of Common Stock, calculated to the nearest full share, obtained by (X) multiplying (i) the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being canceled (at the date of such calculation) by (ii) the difference between the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock (at the date of such calculation) and the per share Purchase Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation), and (Y) dividing the product thereof by the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock. For purposes of this Warrant, the “Fair Market Value” of one share of Common Stock shall be (i) if the Common Stock is then traded on the NASDAQ National Market System or any national securities exchange, the last reported sale price of the Common Stock or the closing price quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System or any national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, whichever is applicable, as published in *The Wall Street Journal* the trading day prior to the date of exercise, or (ii) if a public market for the Common Stock does not exist at the time of exercise, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date immediately preceding the date of exercise as determined in good faith by the Company’s Board of Directors, or (iii) if the Warrant is exercised in connection with a Public Offering, the initial public offering price of the Common Stock. 

^Registration Rights. Upon exercise of this Warrant, the Registered Holder shall have the rights of, and shall be deemed to be, an “Investor” under that certain Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, dated December , 2005 (the “Rights Agreement”). By its receipt of this Warrant, the Registered Holder agrees to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement. 

^Replacement of Warrant. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company at its expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and amount. 

^No Impairment. The Company shall not, by any voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Registered Holder against impairment. 

^Notices. In the event that (i) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other stock or securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right, (ii) the Company shall undertake any capital reorganization, any reclassification of its capital stock, any merger or consolidation, any sale, lease, license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or any voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, or (iii) the Company shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of the class of securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights, the Company will deliver to the Registered Holder at least ten (10) days prior written notice specifying, as the case may be, (a) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right or (b) the date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, license, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of the Common Stock (or such other stock or securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, license, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 

^Miscellaneous. 

^^The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for the purpose of issue upon the exercise hereof, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the exercise hereof in full, free and clear of all restrictions upon the sale or transfer, except (a) such as may exist under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, as they may be amended or restated from time to time; (b) such as may exist or arise under agreements between the Registered Holder or the Registered Holder’s predecessor(s) in interest, on the one hand, and the Company or others, on the other hand, with respect to the securities of the Company; and (c) such as may be imposed by applicable securities laws of any state, nation or political subdivision.
