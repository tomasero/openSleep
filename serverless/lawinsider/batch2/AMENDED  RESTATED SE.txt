.  
^^**Registration**.  
^Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company covenants and agrees that as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the date that is 15 days) after the First Closing (the “**Filing Deadline**”), the Company shall have prepared and filed with the SEC one or more Shelf Registration Statements covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities (or, if permitted by the rules of the SEC, otherwise designate an existing Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC to cover such Registrable Securities), and, to the extent the Shelf Registration Statement has not theretofore been declared effective or is not automatical ly effective upon such filing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared or become effective as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the Effectiveness Deadline) and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and in compliance with the Securities Act and usable for resale of such Registrable Securities for a period from the date of its initial effectiveness until the time as there are no such Registrable Securities remaining (including by refiling such Shelf Registration Statement (or a new Shelf Registration Statement) if the initial Shelf Registration Statement expires). Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this Section 3.6(a)(1), in the event the Commission informs the Company that all of the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the initial Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the initial Shelf Registration Statement and file a new Shelf Registration Statement, in either case covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the Commission, on such form available to the Company to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or new Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the SEC Guidance, including without limitation, Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 612.09. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Gui dance sets forth a limitation of the number of Registrable Securities or other shares of Common Stock permitted to be registered on a particular Shelf Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), the number of Registrable Securities or other shares of Common Stock to be registered on such Shelf Registration Statement will be reduced as follows: first, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the shares of Common Stock to be included

^by any Person other than a Holder; second, the Company shall reduce or eliminate any shares of Common Stock to be included by any Affiliate of the Company; and third, the Company shall reduce the number of Registrable Securities to be included by all Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total number of unregistered Registrable Securities held by such Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Holders must be reduced before other Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders. In the event the Company amends the initial Shelf Registration Statement or files a new Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will u se its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more registration statements on such form available to the Company to register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the initial Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the new Shelf Registration Statement. No Holder shall be named as an “underwriter” in any Registration Statement without such Holder’s prior written consent.

^Except as provided in Section 3.6(a)(7), any registration pursuant to this Section 3.6(a) shall be effected by means of a shelf registration under the Securities Act (a “**Shelf Registration Statement**”) in accordance with the methods and distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415. If the Purchasers or any other holder of Registrable Securities to whom the registration rights conferred by this Agreement have been transferred in compliance with this Agreement intends to distribute any Registrable Sec urities by means of an underwritten offering it shall promptly so advise the Company and the Company shall take all reasonable steps to facilitate such distribution, including the actions required pursuant to Section 3.6(c). The lead underwriters in any such distribution shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be distributed.

^[Intentionally Omitted]  
^If the Company proposes to register any of its securities, whether or not for its own account (including, without limitation, pursuant to the exercise of any demand registration rights by either Anchor Investor pursuant to the Anchor Investment Agreement), other than a registration pursuant to **Sections 3.6(a)(1)** or **3.6(a)(7)** or a Special Registration, and the registration form to be filed may be used for the registration or qualification for distribution of Registrable Securities, the Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchasers and all other Holders of its intention to effect such a re gistration (but in no event less than ten Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date) and shall include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten Business Days after the date of the Company’s notice (a “**Piggyback Registration**”). Any such person that has made such a written request may withdraw its Registrable Securities from such Piggyback Registration by giving written notice to the Company and the managing underwriter, if any, on or before the fifth Business Day prior to the planned effective date of such Piggyback Registration. The Company may terminate or withdraw any registration under this Section 3.6(a)(4) prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not the Purchasers or any other Holders have elected to include Registrable Securit ies in such registration.

^If the registration referred to in Section 3.6(a)(4) is proposed to be underwritten, the Company shall so advise the Purchasers and all other Holders as a part of the written notice given pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(4). In such event, the right of the Purchasers and all other Holders to registration pursuant to this Section 3.6(a)(4) shall be conditioned upon such persons’ participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such persons’ Registrable Securities in the underwriting, and each such person shall (together with the Company and the other persons distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company. If any participating person disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such Person may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company, the managing underwriter and the Purchasers.

^In the event (x) that the Company grants “piggyback” registration rights to one or more third parties to include their securities in an underwritten offering under the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(2) or (y) that a Piggyback Registration under Section 3.6(a)(4) relates to an underwritten offering, and in any such case the managing underwriters advise the Company that in their rea sonable opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the Company shall include in such registration or prospectus only such number of securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), which securities shall be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, solely in the case of a Piggyback Registration under Section 3.6(a)(4) relating to a primary offering on behalf of the Company, any securities the Company proposes to sell for its own account, (ii) second, Common Stock and other securities of the Company issued to Treasury, (iii) third, Registrable Securities of (A) the Purchasers and all other Holders who have requested registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to **Sections** **3.6(a)(2)** or **3.6(a)(4)**, as applicable, and (B) any Anchor Investor that has requested registration of its Registrable Securities pursuant to the exercise of the demand registration rights provided in the Anchor Investment Agreement, in each case, pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of such securities or shares owned by each such person and (iv) fourth, any other securities of the Company that have been requested to be so included, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

^In addition to any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, and use its reasonable best efforts thereafter to cause to be effective, registration statements permitting the sale and distribution in an underwritten offering of up to that number of Registrable Securities equal, in each case, to [[Percentage 8: Number]]% of the Registrable Securities outstanding as of the First Closing Date (as to each such underwritten offering, the “**Offering Ceiling**”) (i) first, as soon as practicable after the date twelve months after the First Closing Date (the “**First Secondary Offering Reg istration**”), and (ii) second, as soon as practicable after the date twelve months after the closing of the First Secondary Offering Registration (the “**Second Secondary Offering Registration**” and, together with the First Secondary Offering Registration, the “**Secondary Offering Registrations**”; each, a **Secondary Offering Registration**”). Each such offering shall be underwritten by one or more managing underwriter selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be distributed, and shall be effected on a “best efforts” basis unless otherwise agreed by the Company, Holders of a majority

^of the Registrable Securities to be distributed and the managing underwriters of such registration. With respect to each Secondary Offering Registration, the Company shall give prompt written notice to the Investors of its intention to effect such Secondary Offering Registration (but, in each case, no less than ten Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date), and shall include in such Secondary Offering Registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein from an Investor within five (5) Business Days of the Company’s notice pursuant to this Section 3.6(a)(7), provided that the Anchor Investors shall only be permitted to participate in the Second Secondary Offering Registration. In the event that the amount of Registrable Securities requested to be included by Holders in either Secondary Offering Registration exceeds the Offering Ceiling for such registration, the amount of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by each Holder shall be reduced proportionally based on its pro rata ownership of the Registrable Securities as of the First Closing Date. As to each Secondary Offering Registration, if the managing underwriters of the underwritten offering to which it relates advise the Company that in their reasonable opinion the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering (after giving effect to any proportional reduction to a level not in excess of the Offering Ceiling) exceeds the number which can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such o ffering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the Company shall include in such registration or prospectus only such number of securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), which securities shall be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, Common Stock and other securities of the Company issued to the Treasury, (ii) second, Registrable Securities of the Purchasers and all other Holders, pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of such securities or shares owned by each such Person and (iii) third, any other securities of the Company that have been requested to be so included, subject to the terms of the Transaction Documents.

^In the event that Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities under Section 3.6(a)(1), the Company shall (i) register the resale of the Registrable Securities on another appropriate form, including, without limitation, Form S-1, and (ii) undertake to register the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 promptly after such form is available, provided that the Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement then in effect until such time as a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities has been declared effective by the Commission.

^^**Expenses of Registration**. All Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance hereunder shall be borne by the Company. All Selling Expenses incurred in connection with any registrations hereunder shall be borne by the Holders selling in such registration pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of securities or shares being sold.

^^**Obligations of the Company**. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts for so long as there are Registrable Securities outstanding, to take such actions as are under its control to not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act).

^Use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders or any managing underwriter(s), to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such registration statement remains in effect, and to take any other action which may be reasonably necessary to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned by such Holder; provided, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions.

^Notify each Holder of Registrable Securities at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the applicable prospectus, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing (which notice shall not contain any material non-public information).

^if at any time the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any underwriting agreement contemplated by Section 3.6(c)(12) cease to be true and correct.

^Use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance or obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement referred to in Section 3.6(c)(8)(C) at the earliest practicable time.

^^**Indemnification**.  
^The Company agrees to indemnify each Holder and, if a Holder is a person other than an individual, such Holder’s officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates, and each Person, if any, that controls a Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an “**Indemnitee**”), against any and all Losses, joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any documents incorporated therein by reference or con tained in any free writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405) prepared by the Company or authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder (or any amendment or supplement thereto); or any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that the Company shall not be liable to such Indemnitee in any such case to the extent that any such Loss is based solely upon (i) an

^untrue statement or omission made in such registration statement, including any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any such amendments or supplements thereto or contained in any free writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405) prepared by the Company or authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with information regarding such Indemnitee or its plan of distribution or ownership interests which was furnished in writing to the Company by such Indemnitee expressly for use in connection with such registration statement, including any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any such amendments or supplements thereto, or (ii) offers or sales effected by or on behalf such Indemnitee “by means of” (as defined in Rule 159A) a “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405) that was not authorized in writing by the Company. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of an Indemnitee and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holders.

^If any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have mater ially and adversely prejudiced the Company.

An Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee or Indemnitees unless: (1) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Company shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee in any such proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnitee and the Company, and such Indemnitee shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest exists if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnitee and the Company; provided, that the Company shall not be liabl e for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all Indemnitees. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any Indemnitee is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, all fees and expenses of the Indemnitee (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section 3.6(g)(2)) shall be paid to the Indemnitee, as incurred, within twenty (20) Business Days of written notice thereof to the Company; provided, that the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Company for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions for which such Indemnitee is finally judicially determined to not be entitled to indemnification hereunder). The failure to deliver written notice to the Company within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve the Company of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 3.6(g), except to the extent that the Company is materially and adversely prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

^If the indemnification provided for in Section 3.6(g)(1) is unavailable to an Indemnitee with respect to any Losses or is insufficient to hold the Indemnitee harmless as contemplated therein, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Indemnitee and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; the Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 3.6(g)(3) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 3.6(g)(1). No Indemnitee guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from th e Company if the Company was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

^The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 3.6(g) are in addition to any liability that the Company may have to the Indemnitees and are not in diminution or limitation of the indemnification provisions under Article V of this Agreement.

^^**Assignment of Registration Rights**.

^^In the event that, at or prior to either Closing, (i) the number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding is changed as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including reverse split), stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock), merger, tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, (ii) the Company fixes a record date that is at or prior to the applicable Closing Date for the payment of any non-stock dividend or distribution on the Common Stock other than any ordinary cash dividends, then the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Purchasers at the applicable Closing under this Agreement, together with the applicable per share price (and the number of shares and per share price pursuant to the Rights Offering and the backstop commitment), shall be equitably adjusted and/or the shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Purchasers at the applicable Closing under this Agreement shall be equitably substituted with shares of other stock or securities or property (including cash), in each case, to provide the Purchasers with substantially the same economic benefit from this Agreement as the Purchasers had prior to the applicable transaction.

The New Securities that a Purchaser shall be entitled to purchase in the aggregate shall be determined b y multiplying (x) the total number or principal amount of such offered New Securities by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock held by the such Purchaser and its Affiliates (assuming full conversion or exercise of any securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding immediately preceding any offering of New Securities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a Purchaser have the right to purchase securities hereunder to the extent that such purchase would result in such Purchaser exceeding the ownership limitations of the Purchasers set forth in Section 3.9.

^^**Notice**. In the event the Company proposes to offer or sell New Securities that are subject to a Purchaser’s rights under Section 3.11(a), it shall give such Purchaser written notice of its intention, specifying the price (or range of prices), anticipated amount of securities, timing and other terms upon which the Company proposes to offer the same (including, in the case of a registered public offering and to the extent possible, a copy of the prospectus included in the registration statement filed with respect to such offering), at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed offer, issuance or sale. A Purchaser shall have twenty-five (25) days from the date of receipt of such a notice to notify the Company in writing that it intends to exercise its rights provided in this Section 3.11 and as to the amount of New Securities such Purchaser desires to purchase, up to the maximum amount calculated pursuant to Section 3.11(a). Such notice shall constitute a non-binding agreement of such Purchaser to purchase the amount of New Securities so specified at the price and other terms set forth in the Company’s notice to it. The failure of a Purchaser to respond within such twenty-five (25) day period shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Purchaser’s rights under this Section 3.11 only with respect to the offering described in the applicable notice.

^^**Purchase Mechanism**. If a Purchaser exercises its rights provided in this Section 3.11, the closing of the purchase of the New Securities with respect to which such right has been exercised shall take place within sixty (60) days after the giving of notice of such exercise, provided that, if such issuance is subject to regulatory approval, such sixty (60)-day period shall be extended until the expiration of ten (10) Business Days after all such approvals have been received, but in no event later than one-hundred-twenty (120) days from the date of the Company’s initial notice pursuant to Section 3.11(b).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such sale is subject to the receipt of any regulatory or stockholder approval or consent or the expiration of any waiting period, the time period during which such sale may be consummated shall be extended until the expiration of five (5) Business Days after all such approvals or consents have been obtained or waiting periods expired, but in no event shall such time period exceed 90 days from the date of the applicable agreement with respect to such sale. In the event the Company has not sold the Common Stock or entered into an agreement to sell the Common Stock within such 90-day period (or sold and issued Common Stock in accordance with the foregoing within 30 days from the date of said agreement (as such period may be extended in the manner described above for a period not to exceed 90 days from the date of such agreement)), the Company shall not thereafter offer, issue or sell such Common Stock without first offering such securities to the Purchasers in the manner provided above.

^^**Non-Cash Consideration**. In the case of the offering of securities for consideration in whole or in part other than cash, including securities acquired in exchange therefor (other than securities by their terms so exchangeable), the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that such fair value as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors shall not exceed the aggregate market price of the securities being offered as of the date the Board of Directors authorizes the offering of such securities.  
^^**Cooperation**. The Company and each Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate the exercise of such Purchaser’s rights under this Section 3.11, including securing any required approvals or consents.
