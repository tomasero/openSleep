\centered **SECURITIES INVESTMENT AND SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT**

THIS SECURITIES INVESTMENT AND SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT, dated as of [[Date 1: Date]] (this “***Agreement***”), is by and between [[Company]], with corporate registration number 992 714 344 (the “***Company***”), and each of the investors that are or become party to this Agreement as evidenced by the execution by such investor of a counterpart signature page to this Agreement (such investor, and [[Party 2]], are each referred to herein as an “***Investor***” and, collectively, as the “***Investors***”.

^This Agreement contemplates the issuance by the Company to the Investors of up to approximately [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, having a nominal value of NOK 1.00 per share (the “***Series B Preferred Stock***”), for a subscription price of NOK 10.00 per share. It is anticipated that the sale and issuance of Series B Preferred Stock hereunder will occur in two or more closings. In order to meet the Company’s immediate funding needs, it is anticipated that a smaller, first closing of approximately [[Shares 2: Number]] shares of Series B Preferred Stock will occur promptly following the date hereof, and the second and any additional closings for the remainder of the Series B Preferred Stock will occur on or about [[Date 2: Date]] or as otherwise determined in accordance with this Agreement. The Company gives no assurances that the timing and the amount of each closing will be as described in the foregoing sentence. Each closing hereunder is referred to herein a “***Closing***” and the first closing hereunder is referred to herein as the “***First Closing***”.

^The Series B Preferred Stock is senior to the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, having a nominal value of NOK 1.00 per share (the “***Series A Preferred Stock***”), and the Company’s common stock, having a nominal value of NOK 1.00 per share (the “***Common Stock***”). As of the date hereof, each Investor has committed to subscribe for the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock set forth opposite its name on ***Exhibit A***. This Agreement shall not in any respect prevent the Company from raising further capital, through a share offering or otherwise, including sales of Series B Preferred Stock to new and existing Investors.

^The terms of the Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock are set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Association (which are subject to approval by the Company’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (EGM)), a copy of which is annexed hereto as ***Exhibit B*** (the “”). The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock will include, among other things, (i) a priority in liquidation that is senior to all other capital stock of the Company, including the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) an annual cumulative cash dividend of NOK 1.00, (iii) a liquidation preference equal to two times the sum of its subscription price and accrued and unpaid dividends, (iv) two votes per share, and (v) cash redemption rights. The Series B Preferred Stock will be convertible into Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock into which Series B Preferred Stock are convertible are sometimes referred to herein as the “***Conversion Shares***”.

^On or prior to the First Closing, the existing Shareholders Agreement among the Company’s shareholders will have been duly and validly amended and restated into the form annexed hereto as ***Exhibit C*** (the “***Shareholders Agreement***”).

^On or prior to the First Closing, [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 2 Name]]/Rebelijo AS will each tender to the Company for cancellation (and for no consideration) one-half of the “ATVM Warrant” exercisable for Series B Preferred Stock that it received in the prior Series B Preferred Stock financing (for the avoidance of doubt, neither party is tendering for cancellation any of the warrants it received in connection with the bridge financing provided to the Company during its recent debt-settlement proceeding).

^Each Investor will receive a warrant exercisable for Series B Preferred Stock (the “***New ATVM Warrants***”). The number of New ATVM Warrants received by each Investor will be equal to the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased by such Investor multiplied by the lesser of (i) 0.75 and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is 18,000,000 and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued under this Agreement. The New ATVM Warrants will have a term of one year from the date of the First Closing, and a per share exercise price of NOK 10.00 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits and similar events). The New ATVM Warrants will be issued to the Investors promptly after the final Closing hereunder.

^Investors will have the right to put their shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased under this Agreement to Ener1, Inc. (“***Ener1***”)in consideration for Ener1 common stock, subject to the limitations described below. The per share put price will be US$[[USD Value 3: Number]] (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits and similar events), and the number of shares of Ener1 common stock issued in connection with a put will be calculated using the 15 day moving average price of Ener1 common stock subject to a floor price of US$[[USD Value 4: Number]] (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits and similar events). Each Investor that exercises such put right will be required to assign to Ener1 for no additional consideration one-half of the New ATVM Warrants it received as part of its purchase of the Series B Preferred Stock subject to such put. Ener1 will undertake to register its shares of common stock issued in connection with such put with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “***SEC***”). This put right will have a term of one year from the date of the First Closing, and all of the terms and conditions pertaining to this put right are set forth in the Shareholders Agreement. The aggregate put amount that Ener1 will be obligated to honor will be capped at US$[[USD Value 1: Number]] and the maximum amount an Investor may put to Ener1 will be equal to the product of US$[[USD Value 2: Number]] and a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased by such Investor under this Agreement, and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased by all Investors under this Agreement other than Ener1. The foregoing put right will not be granted to [[Organization 3 Name]].

^The issuance and sale of the Series B Preferred Stock, Conversion Shares and the shares for which the New ATVM Warrants are exercisable (collectively, the “***Securities***”) by the Company to U.S. Investors shall be effected in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration afforded by the provisions of Regulation D (“***Regulation D***”), as promulgated by the SEC under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

The Company shall not be liable to any Holder Party under this Section 6 (1) for any settlement by a Holder Party effected without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (2) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to such Holder Party’s wrongful actions or omissions, or gross negligence or to such Holder Party’s breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Holder in any of the Transaction Documents.
