The proration of real property taxes or installments of assessments shall be based upon the assessed valuation and tax rate figures (assuming payment at the earliest time to allow for the maximum possible discount) for the year in which the Closing occurs to the extent the same are available; provided, however, that in the event that actual figures (whether for the assessed value of the Property or for the tax rate) for the year of Closing are not available at the Closing Date, the proration shall be made using figures from the preceding year (assuming payment at the earliest time to allow for the maximum possible discount). The proration of real property taxes or installments of assessments shall be final and not subject to re-adjustment after Closing.  
^^^ \centered **5.4.5 Property Contracts**. Except for those Property Contracts which are terminated pursuant to the terms of this Contract, Purchaser shall assume at Closing the obligations under the Property Contracts assumed by Purchaser; however, operating expenses shall be prorated under Section 5.4.2. 
^^^ \centered **5.4.6 Leases.** 
^^^^ \centered 5.4.6.1 All collected rent (whether fixed monthly rentals, additional rentals, escalation rentals, retroactive rentals, operating cost pass-throughs or other sums and charges payable by Tenants under the Leases), income and expenses from any portion of the Property shall be prorated as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall receive all collected rent and income attributable to dates from and after the Closing Date. Seller shall receive all collected rent and income attributable to dates prior to the Closing Date. In addition, if Purchaser elects to terminate any utility rebilling contract associated with the Property, then Seller shall receive a credit at Closing equal to the average of the amount of the monthly utility bill associated with the Property for the preceding 12 months, multiplied by 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no prorations shall be made in relation to either (a) non-delinquent rents which have not been collected as of the Closing Date, or (b) delinquent rents existing, if any, as of the Closing Date (the foregoing (a) and (b) referred to herein as the "**Uncollected Rents**"). In adjusting for Uncollected Rents, no adjustments shall be made in Seller's favor for rents which have accrued and are unpaid as of the Closing, but Purchaser shall pay Seller such accrued Uncollected Rents as and when collected by Purchaser. For a period of 180 days following Closing, Purchaser agrees to bill Tenants of the Property for all Uncollected Rents and to take reasonable actions (which shall not include an obligation to commence legal action) to collect Uncollected Rents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser's obligation to collect Uncollected Rents shall be limited to Uncollected Rents of not more than 90 days past due, and Purchaser's collection of rents shall be applied, first, towards current rent due and owing under the Leases, second to Purchaser’s reasonable third-party costs of such collection, and, third, to Uncollected Rents. After the Closing, Seller shall continue to have the right, but not the obligation, in its own name, to demand payment of and to collect Uncollected Rents owed to Seller by any Tenant, which right shall include, without limitation, the right to continue or commence legal actions or proceedings against any Tenant and the delivery of the Leases Assignment shall not constitute a waiver by Seller of such right; provided however, that the foregoing right of Seller shall be limited to actions seeking monetary damages and, in no event, shall Seller seek to evict any Tenants in any action to collect Uncollected Rents. Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection with all efforts by Seller to collect such Uncollected Rents and to take all steps, whether before or after the Closing Date, as may be necessary to carry out the intention of the foregoing; provided, however, that Purchaser’s obligation to cooperate with Seller pursuant to this sentence shall not obligate Purchaser to terminate any Tenant lease with an existing Tenant or evict any existing Tenant from the Property. 
^^^^ \centered 5.4.6.2 At Closing, Purchaser shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the received and unapplied balance of all cash (or cash equivalent) Tenant Deposits, including, but not limited to, security, damage, pet or other refundable deposits paid by any of the Tenants to secure their respective obligations under the Leases, together, in all cases, with any interest payable to the Tenants thereunder as may be required by their respective Tenant Lease or state law (the “**Tenant Security Deposit Balance**”). Any cash (or cash equivalents) held by Seller which constitutes the Tenant Security Deposit Balance shall be retained by Seller in exchange for the foregoing credit against the Purchase Price and shall not be transferred by Seller pursuant to this Contract (or any of the documents delivered at Closing), but the obligation with respect to the Tenant Security Deposit Balance nonetheless shall be assumed by Purchaser. The Tenant Security Deposit Balance shall not include any non-refundable deposits or fees paid by Tenants to Seller, either pursuant to the Leases or otherwise. 
^^^ \centered **5.4.7 Insurance**. No proration shall be made in relation to insurance premiums and insurance policies will not be assigned to Purchaser. Seller shall have the risk of loss of the Property until the completion of the closing on the Closing Date (“**Risk of Loss Transfer**”), after which time the risk of loss shall pass to Purchaser and Purchaser shall be responsible for obtaining its own insurance thereafter. 
^^^ \centered **5.4.8 Employees**. All of Seller’s and Seller’s manager’s on-site employees shall have their employment at the Property terminated as of the Closing Date. 
^^^ \centered **5.4.9 Closing Costs**. Purchaser shall pay the cost of (a) any recording fees and sales, use, gross receipts or similar taxes, (b) all recordation and transfer taxes, documentary stamp taxes and similar charges, if any, applicable to the transfer of the Property to Purchaser, (c) all mortgage recording fees and taxes with respect to any mortgage loan obtained by Purchaser in connection with its purchase of the Property, (d) any premiums or fees required to be paid by Purchaser with respect to the Title Policy pursuant to Section 4.1, and (d) one-half of the customary closing costs of the Escrow Agent. Seller shall pay (x) the base premium for the Title Policy to the extent required by Section 4.1 and (y) one-half of the customary closing costs of the Escrow Agent.  
^^^ \centered **5.4.10 Possession**. Possession of the Property, subject to the Leases, Property Contracts, other than Terminated Contracts, and Permitted Exceptions, shall be delivered to Purchaser at the Closing upon release from escrow of all items to be delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.3. To the extent reasonably available to Seller, originals or copies of the Leases and Property Contracts, lease files, warranties, guaranties, operating manuals, keys to the property, and Seller’s books and records (other than proprietary information) (collectively, “**Seller’s Property-Related Files and Records**”) regarding the Property shall be made available to Purchaser at the Property after the Closing. Purchaser agrees, for a period of not less than three (3) years after the Closing (the “**Records Hold Period**”), to (a) provide and allow Seller reasonable access to Seller’s Property-Related Files and Records for purposes of inspection and copying thereof, and (b) reasonably maintain and preserve Seller’s Property-Related Files and Records. If at any time after the Records Hold Period, Purchaser desires to dispose of Seller’s Property-Related Files and Records, Purchaser must first provide Seller prior written notice (the “**Records Disposal Notice**”). Seller shall have a period of 30 days after receipt of the Records Disposal Notice to enter the Property (or such other location where such records are then stored) and remove or copy those of Seller’s Property-Related Files and Records that Seller desires to retain.  
^^ \centered 5.5 Post Closing Adjustments. 

Purchaser or Seller may request that Purchaser and Seller undertake to re-adjust any item on the Proration Schedule (or any item omitted therefrom), with the exception of real property taxes which shall be final and not subject to readjustment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.4 of this Contract; provided, however, that neither party shall have any obligation to re-adjust any items (a) after the expiration of 60 days after Closing, or (b) subject to such 60-day period, unless such items exceed $[[USD Value 6: Number]] in the aggregate.

^ \centered ARTICLE XI RISK OF LOSS OR CASUALTY 
^^ \centered 11.1 Major Damage. 

In the event that the Property is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty after the Effective Date, but prior to Risk of Loss Transfer, and the cost for demolition, site cleaning, restoration, replacement, or other repairs (collectively, the **“Repairs**”), is more than $[[USD Value 11: Number]] (a **“Major Damage”**), then Seller shall have no obligation to make such Repairs, and shall notify Purchaser in writing of such damage or destruction (the **“Damage Notice”**). If there is a Major Damage, then Purchase may elect, by delivering written notice to Seller on or before the earlier of (x) Closing and (y) the date which is ten (10) days after Purchaser’s receipt of the Damage Notice, to terminate this Contract.

If that the Property is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty after the Effective Date, but prior to Risk of Loss Transfer, and the cost of Repairs is equal to or less than $[[USD Value 11]], then this transaction shall be closed in accordance with Section 11.3, notwithstanding such casualty. In such event, Seller may at its election endeavor to make such Repairs to the extent of any recovery from insurance carried on the Property, if such Repairs can be reasonably effected before the Closing. Regardless of Seller’s election to commence such Repairs, or Seller’s ability to complete such Repairs prior to Closing, this transaction shall be closed in accordance with Section 11.3 below.

^^ \centered 11.4 Repairs. 

If, in connection with this Article 11, Seller elects to commence any Repairs prior to Closing, then Seller shall be entitled to receive and apply available insurance proceeds to any portion of such Repairs completed or installed prior to Closing, with Purchaser being responsible for completion of such Repairs after Closing. To the extent that any Repairs have been commenced prior to Closing, then the Property Contracts shall include, and Purchaser shall assume at Closing, all construction and other contracts entered into by Seller in connection with such Repairs; provided however, that (except in the event of emergency, as determined in Seller’s sole discretion) Seller will consult with Purchaser prior to entering into any such contract if Purchaser will likely have to assume such Contract.

If Purchaser so terminates this Contract, then Escrow Agent shall release the Deposit to Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to terminate this Contract within such 10-day period, this transaction shall be closed in accordance with the terms of this Contract for the full Purchase Price and Purchaser shall receive the full benefit of any condemnation award.
