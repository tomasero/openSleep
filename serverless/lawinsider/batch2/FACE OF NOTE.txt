^Interest 

[[Organization 4 Name]], a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the “Company”), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. 

The Company will pay interest semiannually on [[Date 2]] and [[Date 3]] of each year commencing [[Date 6: Date]]. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the Notes or, if no interest has been paid, from [[Date 7: Date]]. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal, and on overdue premium (plus interest on such interest to the extent lawful), at the rate borne by the Notes to the extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 

^Method of Payment 

By no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date on which any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note is due and payable, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest. The Company will pay interest (except Defaulted Interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the [[Date 4]] or [[Date 5]] next preceding the interest payment date even if Notes are cancelled, repurchased or redeemed after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made by the transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by [[Organization 1 Name]] or any successor depository. The Company will make all payments in respect of a Definitive Note (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; *provided, however*, that payments on the Notes may also be made, in the case of a Holder of at least $[[USD Value 1: Number]] aggregate principal amount of Notes, by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 15 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 

^Paying Agent and Registrar 

Initially, [[Organization 5 Name]] (the “Trustee”) will act as Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company or any of its domestically organized, wholly owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar. 

^Indenture 

The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of [[Date 7]] (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, the “Indenture”), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. §§ 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the “Act”). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms. 

The Notes are secured senior obligations of the Company. The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture is unlimited, *provided* that at least the net cash proceeds from any issuance of Additional Notes are invested in Additional Assets in accordance with the Indenture. This Note is one of the [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 referred to in the Indenture. The Notes include (i) $[[USD Value 2: Number]] aggregate principal amount of the Company’s [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 issued under the Indenture on [[Date 7]] (herein called “Initial Notes”), (ii) if and when issued, additional [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 of the Company that may be issued from time to time under the Indenture subsequent to [[Date 7]] (herein called “Additional Notes”) as provided in Section 2.1(a) of the Indenture and (iii) if and when issued, the Company’s [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 that may be issued from time to time under the Indenture in exchange for Initial Notes or Additional Notes in an offer registered under the Securities Act as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement (herein called “Exchange Notes”). The Initial Notes, Additional Notes and Exchange Notes are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture and shall be secured by first and second priority Liens and security interests, subject to Permitted Liens, in the Collateral. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, the making of restricted payments, the sale of assets, the incurrence of certain liens, sale-leaseback transactions, transaction with affiliates, the making of payments for consents, business activities, designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries, the entering into of agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries and the consummation of mergers and consolidations. The Indenture also imposes requirements with respect to the provision of financial information and the provision of guarantees of the Notes by certain subsidiaries. 

To guarantee the due and punctual payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest (including post-filing or post-petition interest) on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Company under the Indenture, the Notes, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement when and as the same shall be due and payable, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, according to the terms of the Notes and the Indenture, the Guarantors have unconditionally guaranteed (and future guarantors, together with the Guarantors, will unconditionally guarantee), jointly and severally, such obligations on a senior, secured basis pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. 

^Redemption and prepayment; Springing Maturity 

Except as described below, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Company’s option prior to [[Date 8: Date]]. 

At any time prior to [[Date 8]] the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem up to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Special Interest, if any, to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings of the Company (or of any Parent, to the extent such proceeds are contributed to the Company’s common equity capital); *provided* that: 

^at least [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued under the Indenture (excluding Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and 

^the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering or contribution. 

At any time prior to [[Date 8]] the Company may also redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address, at a redemption price equal to [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Special Interest, if any, to the date of redemption (the “*Redemption Date*”), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. 

At any time prior to [[Date 8]], during any twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date the Company may redeem up to [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 

On or after [[Date 8]] the Company may redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest and Special Interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on [[Date 3]] of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date: 

**Year**      **Percentage**

^^%

^^%

^^%
2015 and thereafter      100.000   %

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. 

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Note on any redemption date, the greater of: 

^[[Percentage 8: Number]]% of the principal amount of the Note; or 

^the excess of: 

^^the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the Note at [[Date 8]] (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing above) plus (ii) all required interest payments due on the Note through [[Date 8]] (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over 

^^the principal amount of the Note, if greater. 

“Treasury Rate” means, as of any redemption date, the yield to maturity as of such redemption date of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) that has become publicly available at least two business days prior to the redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to [[Date 8]]; *provided*, *however*, that if the period from the redemption date to [[Date 8]] is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used. 

Prior to the mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the conditions precedent to the right of redemption have occurred. Any such notice to the Trustee may be cancelled at any time prior to notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be void and of no effect. The Company will be bound to redeem the Notes on the date fixed for redemption. 

The Company may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. 

Except as set forth in the next succeeding paragraph, the Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. 

The Notes will become due and payable on [[Date 9: Date]] unless on or prior to [[Date 10: Date]], the Indebtedness under the New Holdco Credit Facility has been either (i) repaid and discharged, provided that any Indebtedness incurred in connection with any such repayment and discharge shall comply with clause (ii) of this sentence or (ii) extended, replaced or refinanced with Indebtedness constituting a New Holdco Credit Facility with a Stated Maturity that is at least 91 days after the final Stated Maturity of the Notes. 

^Change of Control Repurchase Provisions 

If a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under paragraph 5 of the Notes, each Holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase from each Holder all or any part (equal to $[[USD Value 3: Number]] or an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Special Interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. 

^Denominations; Transfer; Exchange 

The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of principal amount of $[[USD Value 3]] and whole multiples of $[[USD Value 4]] in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay a sum sufficient to cover any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange of any Note (A) for a period beginning (1) 15 days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redeem Notes and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing or (2) 15 days before an interest payment date and ending on such interest payment date or (B) called for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. 

^Persons Deemed Owners 

The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 

^Unclaimed Money 

If money for the payment of principal premium, if any, or interest remains unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an abandoned property law designates another person and not to the Trustee for payment. 

^Defeasance 

Subject to certain exceptions and conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company at any time may terminate some or all of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or Government Securities for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be. 

^Amendment, Supplement, Waiver 

Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented by the Company, Guarantors and Trustee with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and (ii) any default (other than with respect to nonpayment or in respect of a provision that cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected or, in certain cases described in the Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the consent of Holders of [[Percentage 10: Number]]% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes) or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and, other than with respect to clause (8) below, the Guarantors may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; (3) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to Holders of Notes and Note Guarantees by a successor to the Company or such Guarantor pursuant to Article IV or X of the Indenture; (4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder or under the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement of any such Holder; (5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; (6) to conform the text of the Indenture, Note Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of the “Description of Notes” section of the Offering Memorandum, to the extent that such provision in that “Description of Notes” section was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees; (7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture as of the date hereof; (8) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes; (9) to add additional Collateral to secure the Notes; or (10) to release Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral as provided in Section 11.6 of the Indenture.

^^is caused by a failure to pay any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (a “Payment Default”); or 

^^results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity,

The trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium or Special Interest, if any. 

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the trustee or the collateral agent, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the collateral agent will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the trustee or the collateral agent reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense.

\centered NOTE GUARANTEE 

Pursuant to the Indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of [[Date 7]] among [[Organization 4 Name]], the Guarantors party thereto (each a “Guarantor” and collectively the “Guarantors”) and [[Organization 5 Name]], as trustee (the “Trustee”), each Guarantor, subject to the provisions of Article X of the Indenture, hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes, to the extent lawful, and the Trustee the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Special Interest) on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under the Indenture (including without limitation interest (including Special Interest) accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding, relating to the Company or any Guarantor whether or not a claim for post-filing or post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding and the obligations under Section 7.7 of the Indenture), the Registration Rights Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). 

Each Note Guarantee will be secured on a first-priority basis by the First Priority Collateral owned by such Guarantor and on a second-priority basis by the ABL Collateral owned by such Guarantor. Such Guarantors will also agree to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or the Holders in enforcing any rights under the Note Guarantees. The obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with other Indebtedness of such Guarantors, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is expressly subordinated to the obligations arising under the Note Guarantees, in which case the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to such other Indebtedness. 

Each Guarantor agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under Article X of the Indenture notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation. 

Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. 

Each Guarantor further agrees that its Note Guarantee herein constitutes a Guarantee of payment when due (and not a Guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. 

Except as set forth in Section 10.2 of the Indenture, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligations in full), including any claim of 

waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other person under the Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Collateral Agent for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Company; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity. 

Each Guarantor agrees that its Note Guarantee under the Indenture shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations or such Guarantor is released from its Note Guarantee in compliance with Section 10.2 or Article VIII of the Indenture. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Note Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise. 

In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Trustee or the Trustee on behalf of the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest (including Special Interest) on such Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law). 

Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be accelerated as provided in the Indenture for the purposes of its Note Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Note Guarantee. 

Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section. 

IN WITNESS HEREOF, each Guarantor has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
