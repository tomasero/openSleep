The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty are within the Guarantor’s powers and this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, liquidation or similar laws and equitable principles affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Section 3.01. Guaranty of the Manager’s Obligations. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Beneficiary, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and punctual performance of all of the obligations of the Manager arising under or pursuant to the Agreement (the *“Obligations”*). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor’s liability shall extend to performance of all obligations which constitute part of the Obligations and would be owed by the Manager under the Agreement but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Manager. 

Section 3.02. Guaranty Absolute. The Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations will be performed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Beneficiary, the Guarantor, or the Manager with respect thereto. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty are independent of the Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Manager or whether the Manager is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

^^^any extension, indulgence or renewal with respect to any obligation of the Manager under the Agreement; 

^^^any modification of, or amendment or supplement to, the Agreement;

The Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Beneficiary protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Manager or any other person or entity or any collateral. This is a guaranty of performance, not collection. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are absolute, present and continuing obligations which are not conditional upon the institution of suit against or the exercise of any remedies against the Manager, or any attempt to foreclose or realize upon any security for obligations of the Manager or the taking of any other action with respect to the Manager. 

Section 3.04. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
