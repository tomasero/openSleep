If Supplier has paid or will pay such taxes or charges on [[Organization 1 Name]]’ behalf, Supplier shall separately list on its invoices any such taxes or charges, except where [[Organization 1 Name]] furnishes evidence of a lawful exemption. If value-added tax on the supplies of Supplier is payable by [[Organization 1 Name]] under a reverse charge procedure (*i.e.*, shifting of liability, accounting or payment requirement to recipient of supplies), [[Organization 1 Name]] shall ensure that Supplier will not effectively be held liable for this value-added tax by the relevant taxing authorities or other parties. Where applicable, Supplier shall ensure that its invoices to [[Organization 1 Name]] are issued in such a way that these invoices meet the requirements for deduction of input value-added tax by [[Organization 1 Name]]. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall in no event be liable for the payment of any taxes or like charges based upon the net income of Supplier. 

[[Organization 2 Name]]     

***3.3.2 Exemptions.*** Supplier shall not collect otherwise applicable taxes or like charges if a valid tax exemption certificate is furnished by [[Organization 1 Name]] to Supplier. If Supplier collects taxes and [[Organization 1 Name]] either: (a) subsequently determines that the taxes were not due; or (b) had previously issued to Supplier a valid exemption certificate or (c) [[Organization 1 Name]] subsequently provides a valid exemption certificate, Supplier will make all reasonable efforts to assist [[Organization 1 Name]] in obtaining a refund of such taxes collected in error, including, but not limited to, issuing a credit memo and/or filing a refund claim on behalf of [[Organization 1 Name]] if requested to do so in writing by [[Organization 1 Name]]. 

***3.3.3 Special Provision Relating to State Sales and Use Taxes***. If [[Organization 1 Name]] receives Services in the United States from Supplier and such transfer is subject to sales or use tax of a particular state in the United States, [[Organization 1 Name]] will reimburse Supplier for any such taxes paid by Supplier over and above the purchase price for such goods; provided, however, that [[Organization 1 Name]] shall not reimburse Supplier for any such taxes charged against Supplier or [[Organization 1 Name]] on account of Supplier’s mis-delivery or other failure to comply with [[Organization 1 Name]]’ delivery instructions. 

***3.3.4 Protested Taxes***. Supplier shall promptly notify [[Organization 1 Name]] in writing of: (a) any Tax Assessment by a state or local taxing authority; and (b) any decision with respect to a Tax Assessment which has been appealed or protested; provided, however, that Supplier shall in all instances give [[Organization 1 Name]] written notice of such event no later than *** prior to the date by which a response, protest, contest, or other appeal of such Tax Assessment must be filed. In the first instance, Supplier shall have the exclusive right to contest any Tax Assessment at its own expense. If all or any portion of a Tax Assessment must be paid in order to contest the imposition of any such Tax Assessment in connection with a contest that Supplier elects to pursue, or to avoid the existence of a lien on the assets of Supplier during the pendency of such contest, Supplier shall be responsible for such payment and shall be entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall pay all valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessments (or reimburse Supplier in the event Supplier pays any or all valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessments) upon presentation by Supplier of proof of a valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessment. [[Organization 1 Name]]’ liability for valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessments will be limited to the actual tax that was originally due without respect to any sampling projection that may occur during a tax audit. A “***valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessment***” shall mean one that is issued by a state or local taxing authority in accordance with the applicable Law and which is not subject to any further administrative or judicial review and all times for appeal, reconsideration, or requests for reassessment have run without an appeal, reconsideration, or request for reassessment having been taken. If Supplier elects not to contest a Tax Assessment, Supplier must either: (c) waive its right to reimbursement from [[Organization 1 Name]] for that Tax Assessment in which event [[Organization 1 Name]] shall have no right to contest the Tax Assessment and [[Organization 1 Name]] shall have no liability for such Tax Assessment; or (d) promptly notify [[Organization 1 Name]] in writing that it is: (1) not responding, protesting, contesting, or appealing the Tax Assessment; and (2) seeking reimbursement for the Tax Assessment as if it were a valid final and non-appealable Tax Assessment which notice shall set forth the legal and/or factual basis for not contesting the Tax Assessment along with a copy of the Tax Assessment; provided, however, that Supplier shall in all instances give [[Organization 1 Name]] written notice of such decision to not protest, contest or appeal such Tax Assessment no later than *** prior to the date by which a response, contest, protest or other appeal of such Tax Assessment must be filed; provided, further, that Supplier may not elect the option set forth in **subsection (d)** (e.g., to notify [[Organization 1 Name]] and not protest, contest, or appeal a Tax Assessment) unless Supplier has a good faith belief that there is no reasonable basis in Law or fact for a contest, protest, or appeal of such Tax Assessment; provided, finally, that in the event that Supplier elects the option set forth in **subsection (d)** and fails to notify [[Organization 1 Name]] in writing in time to allow [[Organization 1 Name]] to file a response, protest, or contest, Supplier shall be deemed to have waived its right to seek reimbursement from [[Organization 1 Name]] for that Tax Assessment. In the instance Supplier notifies [[Organization 1 Name]] that it is not contesting the Tax Assessment, [[Organization 1 Name]] may elect, at its sole discretion, to pursue the contest of the Tax Assessment in good faith, at its own expense, or to pay to Supplier the Tax Assessment. If [[Organization 1 Name]] elects to contest a Tax Assessment and, further, in the event that all or a portion of a Tax Assessment must be paid in order to contest the imposition of any such Tax Assessment or to avoid the existence of a lien on the assets of Supplier during the pendency of such contest, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall be responsible for such payment. If any such contest must be pursued in the name of Supplier, Supplier shall permit [[Organization 1 Name]] to pursue and control the contest in the name of Supplier, and Supplier shall have the opportunity to participate fully in the preparation of such contest at its own expense. In any contest of a Tax Assessment, the party bringing the protest shall promptly furnish the other party with written notice of the pending proceeding, copies of all filings in any proceeding, protest, contest, or legal challenge, all rulings issued in connection therewith, all correspondence between such party and the state or local taxing authority, the final resolution thereof, and any action therein that would affect Supplier’s obligation to collect and remit, and the party bringing the contest shall allow the other party to participate in such contest with its own counsel at its own expense. 

[[Organization 2 Name]]

^^Services. Supplier represents and warrants to [[Organization 1 Name]] that it shall perform the Services in a good, workmanlike and professional manner in accordance with Supplier’s standards for the Services and industry practices and standards that generally are applicable to the Services in the country in which the Services are provided; provided, however, that where this Agreement specifies a particular standard or criteria for performance, this warranty is not intended to and does not diminish that standard or criteria for performance.

***7.3.3 Defense Declined***.
