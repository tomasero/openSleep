2.6.1.2   the applicable Aircraft was operated, maintained or inspected in a manner not in accordance with the Technical Data and the manufacturer’s documentation furnished to Buyer (including Service Bulletins and Airworthiness Directives), unless Buyer furnishes evidence acceptable to Bombardier acting reasonably, that such operation, maintenance or inspection was not a cause of the Defect;

2.6.1.3   the applicable Aircraft was operated other than under normal airline use, has been subjected to misuse, abuse, foreign object damage or accident or as been improperly stored or protected against the elements when not in use, unless Buyer furnishes evidence acceptable to Bombardier acting reasonably, that such operation or event was not a cause of the Defect;

2.6.1.6   Buyer did not purchase the relevant product, accessory or part from Bombardier or one of its affiliates.

2.6.2   The warranty applies only to Aircraft in their original configuration as delivered by Bombardier to Buyer or as subsequently modified in accordance with Bombardier’s approved Technical Data or other written approval of Bombardier.

^^**Normal Usage**

Normal wear and tear (including corrosion) and the performance of scheduled maintenance, inspection and overhaul shall not constitute or indicate a Defect or failure under this warranty.

^^**No Fault Found**

In the event that a Warranted Part or Bombardier Spare Part returned to Bombardier under a warranty claim is subsequently established to be serviceable, Bombardier shall be entitled to charge and recover from Buyer all reasonable costs incurred by Bombardier in connection with such warranty claim. In the event the claim is ultimately confirmed to be a legitimate warranty claim, such costs incurred by Bombardier and charged to or recovered from Buyer shall be waived or reimbursed, as the case may be. In the event that repetitive in-service failure occurs following any corrective action procedures in respect of a particular Warranted Part or Bombardier Spare Part subsequently identified by Bombardier on a repeated basis to be “no fault found”, then Bombardier and Buyer shall discuss and mutually agree on a course of further action to identify the problem.

^^**Warranties from Vendors**

Bombardier has made or shall make reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the delivery of the first Aircraft, a warranty of a scope and duration similar to those set forth in Annex B, Article 2.1.1.3, 2.1.1.4 and 2.1.2, or other favorable warranty from Vendors and the Power Plant Part manufacturer, with respect to Vendor Parts and Power Plant Parts installed on or incorporated in the Aircraft at the Delivery Date.

[[Organization 3 Name]]   Page 8 of 18

Except as specifically provided under this Annex B, Article 3, Bombardier shall have no liability or responsibility for any Vendor Parts, Power Plant Parts or Buyer Furnished Equipment and the warranties for Vendor Parts, Power Plant Parts and Buyer Furnished Equipment shall be the responsibility of the relevant Vendor or Power Plant Part manufacturer, and a matter as between Buyer and Vendor or the Power Plant Part manufacturer. Nothing in this Annex B, Article 3 shall be construed to add, vary, modify, restrict, diminish, delete or cancel any warranty provided by Vendors or the Power Plant Part manufacturer under the applicable agreements, if Buyer is entitled to the benefit of such warranty. 

^^**Vendor Warranty Backstop**

Where, in respect of Vendor Parts installed on the Aircraft at the Delivery Date or subsequently purchased as spare parts from Bombardier or its authorized distributor and installed on the Aircraft (for certainty, excluding the Power Plant Parts), the Vendor is in default in the performance of any obligation under any applicable warranty obtained by Bombardier from such Vendor pursuant to Annex B, Article 3.1 above, the warranties and all other terms and conditions of Annex B, Article 2 shall become applicable in respect of the relevant Vendor Part as if said Vendor Part had been a Warranted Part (if such Vendor Part was installed on the Aircraft on the Delivery Date), **[*****]** except that in both cases: (i) the applicable warranty period shall be the Warranty Period as set forth in Annex B, Article 2.2 or in the applicable Vendor Warranty, whichever is shorter, and (ii) all transportation costs associated with the Vendor Part as well as all labour and material costs to gain access to, remove and re-install the Vendor Part on the Aircraft together with any costs and expenses associated with the repositioning of the relevant Aircraft for repairs under the Vendor Warranty shall be borne by Buyer. With respect to Vendor Parts warranty periods starting prior to the delivery of the Aircraft to Buyer, Bombardier where necessary, shall backstop such warranty period to start upon Buyer’s receipt of such Aircraft and to continue for the full original period of such Vendor Parts warranty.

In the event Bombardier backstops the Vendor Warranty as set forth above, then, at Bombardier’s request, Buyer shall assign to Bombardier, and Bombardier shall be subrogated to, all of Buyer’s rights against the relevant Vendor with respect to and arising by reason of such default and Buyer shall provide reasonable assistance to enable Bombardier to enforce the rights so assigned.
