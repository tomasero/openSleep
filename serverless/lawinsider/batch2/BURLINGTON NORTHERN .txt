(formerly known as [[Organization 3 Name]], N.A.), a national banking association, as successor in interest to [[Organization 4 Name]], National Association, as successor in interest to [[Organization 5 Name]], N.A., as successor in interest to [[Organization 6 Name]], as trustee (the “Trustee”).

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company desires to provide for the establishment of a new series of its debentures under the Indenture to be known as its “[[Percentage 1]]% Debentures due [[Date 3]]” (the “Debentures”), the form and substance of such series and the terms, provisions and conditions thereof to be set forth as provided in the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture; 

WHEREAS, the Board of Managers of the Company, pursuant to the resolutions duly adopted on [[Date 4: Date]], has duly authorized the issuance of the Debentures, and has authorized the proper officers of the Company to execute any and all appropriate documents necessary or appropriate to effect each such issuance; 

WHEREAS, this Supplemental Indenture is being entered into pursuant to the provisions of Section 901(7) of the Indenture; 

WHEREAS, the Company has requested that the Trustee execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture; and 

WHEREAS, all things necessary to make this Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Company, in accordance with its terms, and to make the Debentures, when executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the valid obligations of the Company, have been performed, and the execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized in all respects; 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the purchase and acceptance of the Debentures by the Holders thereof, and for the purpose of setting forth, as provided in the Indenture, the form and terms of the Debentures, the Company covenants and agrees with the Trustee, as follows: 

^^^^^ 
^DEFINITIONS  
^Definition of Terms.  

Unless the context otherwise requires:  

^^each term defined in the Indenture has the same meaning when used in this Supplemental Indenture; 

^^the singular includes the plural and vice versa; and 

^^headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect interpretation. 

^GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE DEBENTURES 

^Designation and Principal Amount. 

There is hereby authorized and established a series of Securities under the Indenture, designated as the “[[Percentage 1]]% Debentures due [[Date 3]]”, which is not limited in aggregate principal amount. The aggregate principal amount of the Debentures to be issued shall be as set forth in any Company Order for the authentication and delivery of the Debentures, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture. 

^Maturity.  

The Stated Maturity of principal for the Debentures will be [[Date 3]]. 

^Further Issues.  

The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures, issue additional debentures of that series. Any such additional debentures will have the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms as the Debentures, except for the issue date and, if applicable, the initial interest accrual date and the initial Interest Payment Date. Any such additional debentures, together with the Debentures herein provided for, will constitute a single series of Securities under the Indenture. 

^Form and Payment.  

Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debentures will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; *provided*, *however*, that at the option of the Company payment of interest 

^^^^^ 
may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. 

^Global Securities.  

Upon the original issuance, the Debentures will be represented by one or more Global Securities registered in the name of [[Organization 7 Name]], the nominee of [[Organization 8 Name]] (“DTC”). The Company will issue the Debentures in denominations of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and integral multiples of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] in excess thereof and will deposit the Global Securities with DTC or its custodian and register the Global Securities in the name of [[Organization 7 Name]] DTC shall be the initial Depositary for the Debentures. 

^Definitive Form.  

If (a) (i) the Depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Debentures or (ii) the Depositary has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and in either case a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of notice thereof, (b) an Event of Default has occurred with regard to the Debentures and has not been cured or waived, or (c) the Company at any time and in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depositary determines not to have the Debentures represented by Global Securities, the Company may issue the Debentures in definitive form in exchange for such Global Securities. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in Debentures will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of Debentures, equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have Debentures registered in its name as shall be established in a Company Order. 

^Interest.  

The Debentures will bear interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) from [[Date 1]] at the rate of [[Percentage 1]]% per annum, payable semiannually; interest payable on each Interest Payment Date will include interest accrued from [[Date 1]], or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for; the Interest Payment Dates on which such interest shall be payable are [[Date 5: Date]] and [[Date 6: Date]], commencing on [[Date 7: Date]]; and the Regular Record Date for the interest payable on any Interest Payment Date is the close of business on [[Date 8: Date]] or [[Date 9: Date]], as the case may be, next preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, whether or not that day is a Business Day. 

^Authorized Denominations.  

The Debentures shall be issuable in denominations of $[[USD Value 1]] and integral multiples of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof. 

^Redemption.  

At any time before [[Date 10: Date]], the Debentures are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days’ notice by mail, as a whole or in part, at 

^^^^^ 
the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the principal amount of the Debentures to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 20 basis points, plus in either case any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. The Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) will calculate the Redemption Price. 

At any time on or after [[Date 10]], the Debentures are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days’ notice by mail, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to [[Percentage 2]]% of the principal amount of the Debentures to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 

“Treasury Rate” means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. 

“Comparable Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Debentures that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity with the remaining term of the Debentures. 

“Comparable Treasury Price” means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. 

“Independent Investment Banker” means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company. 

“Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations” means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date. 

“Reference Treasury Dealer” means each of [[Organization 9 Name]], [[Organization 10 Name]] and [[Organization 11 Name]] and their respective successors and one other nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a “Primary Treasury Dealer”) specified from time to time by the Company; provided, however, that if any of the 

^^^^^ 
foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. 

Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Debentures to be redeemed. Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, such notice, if relating to a redemption under the first paragraph of this Section, need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of such Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation. 

Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Debentures or portions thereof called for redemption. 

^Change of Control.  

^^Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all Debentures in accordance with the redemption terms as set forth in the Debentures by giving notice of such redemption to the Holders of the Debentures pursuant to Section 1104 of the Indenture prior to the Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company shall make an irrevocable offer to each Holder of Debentures to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $[[USD Value 2]]) of such Holder’s Debentures at a repurchase price in cash equal to [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the aggregate principal amount of Debentures repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the “Repurchase Price”). 

^^Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company’s option, prior to any Change of Control, but in either case, after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail to each Holder of Debentures, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice: 

^^^describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event; 

^^^offering to repurchase all Debentures tendered; 

^^^setting forth the payment date for the repurchase of the Debentures, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Repurchase Date”); 

^^^if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, stating that the offer to repurchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the Repurchase Date; 

^^^^^ 
^^^disclosing that any Debenture not tendered for repurchase will continue to accrue interest; and 

^^^specifying the procedures for tendering Debentures. 

^^The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Debentures as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 2.10, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 2.10 by virtue of such conflict. 

^^On the Repurchase Date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company shall, to the extent lawful: 

^^^accept for payment all Debentures or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to such offer; 

^^^deposit with the Trustee an amount equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price in respect of all Debentures or portions thereof properly tendered; and 

^^^deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Debentures properly accepted, together with an Officers’ Certificate of the Company stating the aggregate principal amount of Debentures or portions thereof being repurchased by the Company. 

^^The Trustee will promptly mail to each Holder of Debentures properly tendered, the Repurchase Price for such Debentures, and the Trustee, upon the execution and delivery by the Company of such Debentures, will promptly authenticate and cause to be transferred by book-entry to each Holder a new Debenture equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Debentures surrendered; provided that each new Debenture will be in a principal amount of a minimum denomination of $[[USD Value 1]] and an integral multiple of $[[USD Value 2]] in excess thereof. 

^^The Company shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Debentures upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Debentures properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. 

^^Solely for purposes of this Section 2.10 in connection with the Debentures, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

“Below Investment Grade Ratings Event” means that on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Debentures is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating 

^^^^^ 
Agencies) after the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control; or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by the Company to effect a Change of Control, the Debentures are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of such ratings reduction). 

“Change of Control” means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than [[Organization 12 Name]], its Subsidiaries, or its or such Subsidiaries’ employee benefit plans, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the combined voting power of the Company’s Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company’s Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares. 

“Change of Control Repurchase Event” means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event. 

“Investment Grade” means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s (or its equivalent under any successor ratings category of Moody’s); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor ratings category of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company. 

“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. 

“Rating Agency” means (a) each of Moody’s and S&P; and (b) if either of Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Debentures or fails to make a rating of the Debentures publicly available for reasons outside of the Company’s control, a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a written consent or resolution of the Company’s board of managers) as a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be. 

“S&P” means Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of [[Organization 13 Name]], Inc. 

“Voting Stock” of any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock (or other equity interests) of 

^^^^^ 
such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors (or other equivalent body) of such person.

^MISCELLANEOUS  
^Ratification of Indenture.

When used in this paragraph, the term “default” means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures.

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in the aggregate principal amount of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series, issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as this Security, except as provided in said Sixth Supplemental Indenture. 

At any time before [[Date 10]], the Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days’ notice by mail, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) [[Percentage 2]]% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in said Sixth Supplemental Indenture), plus 20 basis points, plus in either case any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. The Independent Investment Banker (as defined in said Sixth Supplemental Indenture) will calculate the Redemption Price. 

At any time on or after [[Date 10]], the Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days’ notice by mail, as a whole or in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to [[Percentage 2]]% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder, upon the cancellation hereof.

^^^^^ 
to Section 1104 of the Indenture prior to the Change of Control Repurchase Event, each Holder of Securities of this series shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $[[USD Value 2]]) of such Holder’s Securities pursuant to the Change of Control notice as provided in, and subject to the terms of, said Sixth Supplemental Indenture at a purchase price in cash equal to [[Percentage 3]]% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
