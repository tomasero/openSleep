\centered Page 8 of 37 

^^^^^ 
^The Company shall prepare and send a statement of commutation value to the Subscribing Reinsurer in respect of such claim(s).

^The Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall attempt to reach settlement by mutual agreement as to the commutation value.

^The commutation value shali be calculated in accordance with the following assumptions and methodologies:

^^Mortality assumptions shall be calculated from the latest available United States (U.S.) Census Table as follows:

Survivor Benefits  Total Female or Male, whichever applies

Disability Benefits  Total Population

The mortality assumptions should reflect: (a) the mortality improvement since the publication of the most recent U.S. Census Table, and (b) the life impairment of the injured worker as determined by the Company.

^^Remarriage expectations shall be in accordance with the assumptions used by the National Council on Compensation Insurance in its statistical tables, adjusted for the gender of the survivor.

^^For all future medical costs, projected cash payments shall be based upon the Company’s projected estimate of long-term medical care and rehabilitation requirements, using the average annual Medical Consumer Price Index (CPI) escalation rate of the past twenty (20) years using the most recent published tables, going back twenty (20) years.

^^For all future indemnity costs, projected cash payments shall be calculated based upon the average historical actual Cost-Of- Living Adjustment (COLA) over however many years of information are available, but no more than twenty (20) years; up through the most recent published data that is available from the State or Federal governing body over Workers Compensation, whichever may apply.

^^The annual interest discount percentage shall be calculated as the average yield to maturity of all United States Treasury Bonds maturing during the calendar quarter that is fifteen (15) years after the calendar quarter in which the commutation value is calculated.

^^The commutation value shall be the total amount of all payments made by the Company for which the Subscribing Reinsurer has not paid its share, plus the discounted present value of all projected future payments as determined by the above calculations.

Effective: [[Date 1]]    2010 Agency Markets Workers’ Compensation Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract No.   

\centered Page 9 of 37 

^^^^^ 
^^The commutation value with respect to each injured worker or fatality shall then be capped at $[[USD Value 3: Number]]

^^The resulting calculations for each claim shall then be summed together. The Company’s retention shall then be subtracted from this amount and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall pay its share of such total.

^In the event the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer are unable to reach agreement on the commutation value, then the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall, within four (4) weeks from the written request of either party, mutually appoint an independent actuary or, in the event that they fail to agree on the selection of an independent actuary within four (4) weeks, each party shall name three independent actuaries of which the other party shall decline two, and the final selection shall be made by drawing lots. All independent actuary candidates shall be disinterested in the outcome of the commutation and shall be Fellows of the Society of Actuaries/Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society. The appointed independent actuary shall investigate, determine, and value the claim(s) using the assumptions and methodologies set forth above. The independent actuary’s determination of the commutation value shall be final and binding. Payment of the commutation value shall be due immediately upon receipt of the independent actuary’s decision. Payment of the commutation value by the Subscribing Reinsurer to the Company or any other third party mutually agreed upon by the Subscribing Reinsurer and the Company shall constitute a complete release of the Subscribing Reinsurer from liability for each such claim.

^The cost of the independent actuary shall be split evenly between the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer. The commutation process described in this Article shall not be subject to any other dispute resolution process, including but not limited to the Arbitration Article of this Contract.

^This Article does not preclude termination or commutation of this Contract as provided in the Special Conditions Article.

^As a condition precedent to access to records under this Article, the Subscribing Reinsurer, its personnel, and any authorized third party representative of the Subscribing Reinsurer shall agree to the provisions of the Confidentiality Article of this Contract.

^The Company reserves the right to withhold any documents from the Subscribing Reinsurer: (1) concerning Trade Secrets of the Company or its Affiliates, (2) subject to the terms of a third party non-disclosure agreement with the Company or its Affiliates requiring third party consent to disclosure, (3) subject to the Work-Product Privilege or Attorney-Client Privilege, or (4) concerning individual private information that, as a matter of law, cannot be disclosed by the Company or its Affiliates (hereinafter referred to in the Contract as “Privileged Documents”). The Company shall reasonably try to exempt the Subscribing Reinsurer from any third party non-disclosure agreement or obtain consent from the third party to disclose to the Subscribing Reinsurer.

^Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall permit and not object to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s access to Privileged Documents falling within D.(3) above, in connection with the underlying claim reinsured hereunder following final settlement or final adjudication of the case or cases involving such claim, with prejudice against all claimants, and all parties to such adjudications; provided that the Company, may defer release of such Privileged Documents if there are subrogation, contribution, or other third party actions with respect to that claim or case, which may jeopardize the Company’s or its Affiliates’ defense by release of such Privileged Documents. In the event that the Company shall seek to defer release of such Privileged Documents or to withhold documents concerning Trade Secrets, it will in consultation with the Subscribing Reinsurer take other steps as reasonably necessary to provide the Subscribing Reinsurer with the information it reasonably requires to indemnify the Company without causing a loss of such privileges or protections. The Subscribing Reinsurer, however, shall not have access to Privileged Documents relating to any dispute between the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer.

^For purposes of this Article, “Trade Secrets” shall have the meaning provided in Section 1839 of the United States Economic Espionage Act of 1996. “AttorneyClient Privilege” shall mean communications of a confidential nature between: (1) the Company or its Affiliates, or anyone retained by or in the control of the Company or its Affiliates, or their in-house or outside legal counsel, or anyone in the control of such legal counsel, and (2) any in-house or outside legal counsel which relate to legal advice being sought by the Company or its Affiliates and/or which contains legal advice being provided to the Company or its Affiliates. “Work-Product Privilege” shall mean communications, written materials, and

tangible things prepared by or for in-house or outside counsel, or prepared by or for the Company or its Affiliates, in anticipation of or in connection with litigation, arbitration, or other dispute resolution proceedings.

ARTICLE 17  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS (Lm-00800-2005.06.02-a) 

Any inadvertent delay, omission, or error in complying with the terms and conditions of this Contract shall not be held to relieve either party hereto from any liability, which would attach to it hereunder if such delay, omission, or error had not been made, provided such delay, omission, or error is rectified upon discovery. 

ARTICLE 18  INSOLVENCY (Lm-01300-2009.09.03-a-Wc) 

If more than one reinsured company is referenced within the definition of “Company” in this Contract, this Article shall apply severally to each such company. Further, this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state shall apply in the event of the insolvency of any company intended to be covered hereunder. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this Article and the laws of the domiciliary state of any company intended to be covered hereunder, that domiciliary state’s laws shall prevail. 

^In the event of the insolvency of the Company, reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable with reasonable provision for verification, on the basis of claims allowed against the insolvent Company by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor of the Company having authority to allow such claims, without diminution because of such insolvency or because such liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims. Such payments by the Subscribing Reinsurer shall be made directly to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor, except to the extent Section 4118(a) of the New York insurance Law applies, or except (1) where the Contract specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company, or (2) where the Subscribing Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Subscribing Reinsurer to the payees under such Policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees.

^It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor of the insolvent Company shall give written notice to the Subscribing Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the insolvent Company on the Policy or Policies reinsured within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding and that during the pendency of such claim the Subscribing Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the Company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator, or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Subscribing Reinsurer

^^^^^ 
shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Company as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit, which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Subscribing Reinsurer.

^Where two or more Subscribing Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elects to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the insolvent Company.

ARTICLE 19  ARBITRATION (LM-00200-2009.10.26-A) 

^Disputes to be Arbitrated. With the exception of any dispute resolution procedures that are otherwise contained in this Contract, any and all disputes between the Company and any Subscribing Reinsurer or Subscribing Reinsurers (“Party” individually or “Parties” collectively) arising out of, relating to, or concerning this Contract, whether sounding in contract or tort and whether arising during or after this Contract’s formation, or after its termination, including disputes as to whether the Contract was validly formed or is voidable, shall be submitted to the decision of an arbitration panel (“Panel”). The Panel shall consist of an umpire and two party-appointed arbitrators unless a Party meets the requirements of paragraph C. of this Article and demands arbitration pursuant thereto, in which case the Panel would consist of an umpire only.

^Procedures. Except as provided herein, any arbitration shall be based upon the Procedures for the Resolution of U.S. insurance arid Reinsurance Disputes; Regular Panel Version, dated [[Date 3: Date]] (the “Procedures”), developed by the insurance and Reinsurance Dispute Resolution Task Force, subject to the following modifications:

^Qualifications of the arbitrators and umpires shall be in accordance with section 6.2 of the Procedures, except that other professionals who have worked for at least ten (10) years for an insurer or reinsurer shall also be qualified to serve as an arbitrator or umpire.

^The Parties hereby designate the umpire list maintained by [[Organization 4 Name]] (U.S.) as the list to be used in the event that section 6.7(a) of the Procedures is invoked. If [[Organization 4 Name]] ceases to maintain a list, each Party shall exchange eight names of qualified umpire candidates and shall follow section 6.7 of the Procedures for the selection of the umpire.

^Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the members of the Panel shall be impartial and disinterested. The members of the Panel may not be: (1) in the control of any Party or its parent, affiliate, or agent, (2) a former director or officer of any Party or its parent, affiliate, or agent, or (3) a likely witness in the arbitration. The requirement of impartiality means that all members of the Panel shall have the same obligation to approach the Panel’s duties and decisions with fairness and without consideration for the fact that Panel members may have been appointed by one of the Parties. The

\centered Page 14 of 37 

^^^^^ 
requirement of impartiality does not mean that any arbitrator can have no previous knowledge of or experience with respect to issues involved in the dispute or disputes.

^The first sentence of section 10.4 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following sentence: “The Panel shall require that each Party submit concise written statements of position, including summaries of the facts and evidence a Party intends to present, discussion of the applicable law and the basis for the requested Award or denial of relief sought,”

^Section 11.1 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following provision: “The Parties may propound discovery seeking disclosure of such information and/or documents relevant to the dispute or necessary for the proper resolution of the dispute.”

^Position statements may be amended at any reasonable time, but not later than the close of discovery, without a showing to the Panel that the amending Party could not reasonably have raised the new claim or issue at an earlier time.

^The Panel shall hold an evidentiary hearing, if one is necessary, within one year of the arbitration demand, unless the Parties otherwise agree. Should a Party seek a reasonable extension to this time frame for good cause shown, the other Party’s agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.

^To the extent permitted by the law, the Panel shall have the authority to issue subpoenas and other orders to enforce its decisions.

^The Panel may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and arbitration costs to the prevailing Party, as determined by the Panel.

^Section 14.3 of the Procedures shall be replaced by the following provision: “The Panel shall make a decision and issue an award with regard to the terms expressed in this Contract, and the custom and practice of the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance business. The Panel shall not be obligated to follow the strict rules of law and evidence.”

^Alternative Streamlined Procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, the Alternative Streamlined Procedures set forth in section 16 of the Procedures, as modified by paragraphs B.3, B.4, and B.8 through B.10 of this Article, shall apply in the event that, in a consolidated proceeding or otherwise, the Party initiating arbitration is seeking payment of a total amount that is no greater than one million dollars ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]), or the currency equivalent thereof. Sections 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and the second sentence of section 16.4 of the Alternative Streamlined Procedures shall not apply. The Parties agree to comply with section 6.7 of the Procedures to appoint a single umpire, and hereby designate the umpire list maintained by [[Organization 4 Name]] (U.S.) as the list to be used in section 6.7(a).

^Hearing Location. The hearing shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the Parties mutually agree to a different location.

^Confirmation. Either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order confirming any award of the Panel; a judgment of that court shall thereupon be entered on any award. If the application for confirmation is contested and a judgment is issued confirming the award, then the Party against whom confirmation is sought shall pay the attorneys’ fees incurred by the Party who applied for the confirmation and all court costs of any such proceeding.

^Equitable Relief from a Court of Law. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any participating Party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a restraining order or other equitable relief to maintain the “status quo” of the Parties participating in the arbitration pending the decision and award by the Panel.

^Consolidated Proceedings.

^*Same contract, single Subscribing Reinsurer.* Both the Company and any single Subscribing Reinsurer on this Contract have the right to combine any and all disputes between them that concern this Contract (including any renewal of this Contract or any contract for which this Contract is a renewal) into a single arbitration proceeding before a single Panel, except that the standard for determining whether a Party may add a new issue, claim, or dispute to an arbitration proceeding shall be the standard for amending a position statement, as set forth in paragraph B.6 of this Article.

^*Multiple contracts, single Subscribing Reinsurer.*

^^Either the Company or any single Subscribing Reinsurer has the right to combine any and all disputes between the Company and such single Subscribing Reinsurer into one arbitration proceeding before a single Panel where such disputes involve this Contract and any additional contracts between the two Parties.

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject in each instance to the mutual agreement of the Parties, new issues, claims, or disputes may be added to such existing arbitration proceeding.

^*Same contract, multiple Subscribing Reinsurers.* At the Company’s option, if more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in arbitration relating to this Contract, where there are common questions of law or fact and a possibility of conflicting awards or inconsistent results, all such Subscribing Reinsurers shall constitute and act as one Party for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of the Subscribing Reinsurers constituting the one Party; provided, however, that the Subscribing Reinsurers shall have the right to assert several, rather than joint defenses or claims, and to be represented by separate counsel. This provision shall not change the liability of each of the Subscribing Reinsurers under the terms of this Contract from several to joint.

^Choice of Law. The law set forth in the Governing Law Article shall apply to this Arbitration Article.

ARTICLE 20  INTEREST PENALTY (LM-01400-2005.08.24-A) 

^The interest amounts provided for in this Article shall apply to the Subscribing Reinsurer or to the Company in the following circumstances:

^If a loss payment owed by the Subscribing Reinsurer to the Company is not received within 45 calendar days following the date of presentation to the Subscribing Reinsurer of information necessary to approve payment of the claim, and/or;

^If any premium payment owed by the Company to the Subscribing Reinsurer is not received within 45 calendar days following the date on which payment is due, and/or;

^If any premium adjustment, agreed by either party to the other, is not received within 150 calendar days following the expiry or anniversary of this Contract, and/or;

^If any return of premiums, commissions, profit sharing, or any amounts hot provided in subparagraphs 1, 2, and 3 above, are not received in accordance with the date specified in this Contract or if no date is specified, within 90 calendar days following the date the debtor party received the billing.

^Failure by the Subscribing Reinsurer or Company to comply with their respective payment obligations within the time periods as herein provided shall, as of that date, be subject to an interest payment computed by multiplying the amount due by a variable rate consisting of the U.S. Prime Rate as published in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal on the first day of the calendar month in which the amount became past due, plus [[Percentage 2: Number]]%. The variable rate shall be adjusted monthly thereafter to equal the U.S. Prime Rate as published in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal on the first day of each successive month during which the amount due remains unpaid, plus [[Percentage 2]]%. The product shall then be multiplied by 1/365 for each day after the due date that the amount due and the interest amount remain unpaid. Any interest that occurs pursuant to this Article shall be calculated by the party to which it is owed.

^The validity of any claim or payment may be contested under the provisions of this Contract. If the debtor party prevails in an arbitration or any other proceeding with respect to the amounts in dispute, there shall be no interest penalty due. if the creditor party wholly or partially prevails on any of the amounts in dispute, the interest penalty shall be awarded as outlined above. Such interest penalty shall be calculated from the date the monies were due and owing to the date of resolution of the arbitration or proceeding, and shall be payable as of the date of resolution of the arbitration or proceeding.

^If a Subscribing Reinsurer advances the entire or partial payment of any claim it is contesting, and wholly or partially prevails in the contest, the Company shall promptly return the applicable amount of such payment. The arbitrator(s) hearing such dispute shall determine if interest shall be added to the amount returned by the Company.

^Any interest owing pursuant to this Article may be waived by the party to which it is owed. Further, any interest calculated pursuant to this Article that is $[[USD Value 8: Number]] or less shall be waived. Any waiver of any interest pursuant to this paragraph, however, shall not affect the waiving party’s right to claim and/or pursue interest for any other failure by the other party to make payment when due under this Article.

ARTICLE 21  DIVIDENDS AND TAXES (LM-00600-2009.03.10-A)

ARTICLE 23  OFFSET (LM-01701-2005.06.02-A) 

Each Party to this Contract together with their successors or assigns shall have and may exercise, at any time, the right to offset any balance(s) due the other (or, if more than one, any other) under this Contract. Such offset may include balances due under this Contract regardless of whether such balances arise from premiums, losses, or otherwise, provided however, that in the event of insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be

^ UNAUTHORIZED REINSURANCE (LM-02500-2009.12.09-A) 

(Applies only to a Subscribing Reinsurer who at the inception of this Contract or at any time thereafter does not qualify for full credit with any insurance regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company’s reserves.) 

^As regards Policies or bonds coming within the scope of this Contract, the Company agrees that when it shall file with the insurance regulatory authority or set up on its books reserves for unearned premium and losses covered hereunder which it shall be required by law to set up, it will forward to the Subscribing Reinsurer a statement showing the proportion of such reserves which is applicable to the Subscribing Reinsurer. The Subscribing Reinsurer hereby agrees to fund such reserves in respect of unearned premium, known outstanding losses that have been reported to the Subscribing Reinsurer and allocated loss adjustment expense relating thereto, losses and allocated loss adjustment expense paid by the Company or the Legal Entities but not recovered from the Subscribing Reinsurer, plus reserves for losses incurred but not reported as determined by the Company, as shown in the statement prepared by the Company (hereinafter referred to as “Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations”) by Letters of Credit, unless the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer agree to another method of funding, or another method of funding (other than Letters of Credit) is mandated by applicable law, statute, or regulation.

^For a Subscribing Reinsurer who, either at the inception of this Contract or at any time thereafter, is unauthorized in any province or jurisdiction of Canada, and as respects risks within Canada for the purposes of the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), such funding shall be equal to [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations or such other amount as may be required by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada.

^When funding by Letters of Credit, the Subscribing Reinsurer agrees to apply for and secure timely delivery to the Company of clean, irrevocable, and unconditional Letters of Credit issued by a bank that is a qualified U.S. financial institution acceptable to the Company, and containing provisions acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company’s reserves, in an amount equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s proportion of said reserves. At the Company’s request, the Subscribing Reinsurer will agree to provide a separate Letter of Credit for each Legal Entity. Such Letters of Credit shall be issued for a period of not less than one year, and shall be automatically extended for one year from the date of expiration or any future expiration date unless, sixty (60) days prior to any expiration date, the issuing bank shall notify the Company or a Legal Entity, as applicable, by certified mail that the issuing bank elects not to consider the Letters of Credit extended for any additional period.

^The Subscribing Reinsurer and the Company agree that the Letters of Credit provided by the Subscribing Reinsurer pursuant to the provisions of this Contract may be drawn upon at any time, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, and be utilized by the Company or a Legal Entity or any successors

thereto, by operation of law, of the Company or a Legal Entity, including without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver, or conservator of the Company, without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or a Legal Entity or the Subscribing Reinsurer for one or more of the following purposes:

^To reimburse the Company or a Legal Entity for the Subscribing Reinsurer’s share of premiums returned to the owners of Policies reinsured under this Contract because of cancellations of the Policies;

^To reimburse the Company or a Legal Entity for the Subscribing Reinsurer’s share of surrenders and benefits or losses paid by the Company or a Legal Entity under provisions of the Policies reinsured under this Contract;

^To fund an account with the Company or a Legal Entity in an amount, at least, equal to the deduction for reinsurance ceded from the Company’s or a Legal Entity’s liabilities for Policies ceded under this Contract. The account shall include, but not be limited to, amounts for Policy reserves, claims and losses incurred (including losses incurred but not reported), loss adjustment expenses, and unearned premium reserves;

^To pay existing liabilities between the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer upon commutation of this Contract; and

^To pay any other amounts the Company claims are due under this Contract.

^If the Company has concluded that the issuing bank’s financial condition is such that the value of the security represented by the Letter of Credit may be in jeopardy, the Company or a Legal Entity, as applicable, may require that a replacement Letter of Credit be issued by a bank acceptable to the Company, by providing the Subscribing Reinsurer with written notice requesting such replacement Letter of Credit. If the Subscribing Reinsurer fails to provide acceptable replacement security within ten (10) business days following receipt of the Company’s notice, the Company or a Legal Entity may draw upon the existing Letter of Credit in amounts equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations.

^At annual intervals, or at the Company’s option, on a quarterly basis, the Company shall prepare a specific statement of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations, for the sole purpose of amending the Letters of Credit, in the following manner:

^If the statement shows that the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations exceed the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of such excess, secure delivery to the Company of an amendment to the Letters of Credit increasing the amount of credit by the amount of such difference.

^If, however, the statement shows that the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations are less than the balance of credit as of the statement date, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written request from

^The Subscribing Reinsurer will take any other reasonable steps that may be required for the Company to take full credit on its statutory financial statements for the reinsurance provided by this Contract.

^Any and all disputes between the Company and any Subscribing Reinsurer or Reinsurers (“Party”, individually, or “Parties”, collectively) arising out of, relating to, or concerning this Article shall be resolved pursuant to the [[Organization 4 Name]]-U.S. Newer Arbitrator Program. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the [[Organization 4 Name]]-U.S. Newer Arbitrator Program expedited proceeding with a single Newer Arbitrator shall be used to resolve any such disputes.

^^Where the Letters of Credit will expire without renewal or be reduced or replaced by Letters of Credit for a reduced amount and where the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations under this Contract remain unliquidated and undischarged ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the Letter of Credit, to withdraw amounts equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations, to the extent that the liabilities have not yet been funded by the Subscribing Reinsurer and exceed the amount of any reduced or replacement Letters of Credit.

^^If the Company has concluded that the issuing bank’s financial condition is such that the value of the security represented by the Letter of Credit may be in jeopardy, the Company or a Legal Entity, as applicable, may require that a replacement Letter of Credit be issued by a bank acceptable to the Company, by providing the Subscribing Reinsurer with written notice requesting such replacement Letter of Credit. If the Subscribing Reinsurer fails to provide acceptable replacement security within ten (10) business days following receipt of the Company’s notice, the Company or a Legal Entity may draw upon the existing Letter of Credit in amounts equal to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations.

^^If the Company or a Legal Entity draws on the Letter of Credit to obtain a cash advance, under paragraphs F.3.b or F.3.c, the Company or the Legal Entity, as applicable, will hold the amount of the cash advance so obtained in trust in the name of the Company in any qualified United States financial institution as defined by the Insurance Law of the Company’s or Legal Entity’s domiciliary state, solely to secure the Obligations and for the use and purposes enumerated above. The Company or the Legal Entity, as applicable, will return any balance to the Subscribing Reinsurer upon the complete and final liquidation and discharge of all of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s Obligations to the Company under this Contract or in the event the Subscribing Reinsurer provides alternative or replacement security consistent with the terms hereof and acceptable to the Company.

^In determining the commutation value, the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer shall utilize the assumptions and methodologies set forth in the Commutation Article of this Contract. In the event the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer cannot agree on the statement of valuation of the Subscribing Reinsurer’s liability under such Policies, either party may request in writing that the differences be settled by a panel of three actuaries. Each party shall appoint an actuary to assess such liability within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written request for commutation. Upon such appointment, the two actuaries shall appoint a third actuary. If the two actuaries fail to agree on the third actuary within thirty (30) days of their appointment, each of them shall nominate three individuals, of whom the other shall decline two, and the final decision shall be made by drawing lots.

^The actuaries shall then investigate and Capitalize such Commutation Loss(es) within thirty (30) days. As used herein, “Capitalize” shall mean to determine the present value of Commutation Losses, without regard to the Subscribing Reinsurer’s ability to pay such losses. In making this determination, the actuaries shall utilize the assumptions and methodologies set forth in the Commutation Article of this Contract. The panel shall meet in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the Company and the Subscribing Reinsurer agree otherwise.

^All actuaries shall be disinterested in the outcome of the commutation and shall be Fellows of the Society of Actuaries/Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial Society. Except as stated below, the expense of the actuaries and of the commutation shall be equally divided between the parties of the commutation.

^The decision in writing of the actuaries, when filed with the parties hereto, shall be final and binding, except that if the Company does not agree with the Capitalized value of the Commutation Loss(es), the Company shall have no obligation to commute. In the event the Company does not agree with the Capitalized value of the Commutation Loss(es) and does not move forward with commutation, the Company will pay the expense of the actuaries including reasonable expense of the actuary appointed by the Subscribing Reinsurer.

If the Subscribing Reinsurer has provided collateral relating to this Contract and the Subscribing Reinsurer attempts to require the Company or a Legal Entity to settle their claims liabilities on an accelerated basis, the Company shall have the right to utilize or to draw upon Letters of Credit or other collateral, under the terms of this Contract, or as otherwise agreed between the Subscribing Reinsurer and the Company.
