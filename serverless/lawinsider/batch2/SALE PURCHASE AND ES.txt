In connection with the Real Property, Seller may possess (i) certain governmental permits and approvals, (ii) certain contractual rights (including the Leases and Contracts, as defined herein) and other intangible assets, and (iii) certain other items of tangible personal property which are located on the Real Property and used by Seller in connection with the operation and maintenance thereof (collectively, the “**Personal Property**”). The Real Property and the Personal Property are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “**Property**.” 

^^Purchase and Sale. Seller now desires to sell and Purchaser now desires to purchase all of Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the Property, upon the terms and covenants and subject to the conditions set forth below.

^^Price. In consideration of the covenants herein contained, Seller hereby agrees to sell and Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase the Property for a total purchase price of Seven Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]) (the “**Purchase Price**”), which shall be paid by Purchaser as follows: 

2.1.1. **Deposit**. Purchaser has delivered concurrently with its execution of this Agreement, or will deliver within two (2) business days after the Effective Date, to Escrow Agent by bank wire of immediately available funds the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) (the “**Deposit**”).

Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, the Additional Funds shall be deemed part of the Deposit. If Purchaser fails to deliver the Additional Funds to Escrow Agent on or before the expiration of the Investigation Period (provided Purchaser has not terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3), such failure shall be a default under this Agreement. 

2.1.3. **Balance of Purchase Price**. Purchaser shall, on or before the Closing (as defined in Section 6.1), deliver to Escrow Agent, by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds, a sum equal to the balance of the Purchase Price.

The indemnity in this Section 5.2.5 shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement. 

5.2.6. **Seller’s Right To Be Present**. Purchaser agrees to give Seller prior written notice at least one (1) business day in advance of its intent to conduct any inspections or tests so that Seller will have the opportunity to have a representative present during any such inspection or test, the right to do which Seller expressly reserves.

The obligations set forth in this Section 5.2.8 shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement. 

^^Investigation Period. Purchaser shall have the right to make the following investigations. 

5.3.1. **Title and Survey**. Purchaser shall have until 5:00 p.m. (New York Time) on the business day which is fifteen (15) days following Purchaser’s receipt of the Preliminary Title Commitment, to notify Seller of any objections (the “**Title Objections**”) with respect to the Title Commitment and the Survey based on its review thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no right to object to any of the matters identified on **Exhibit K** attached hereto (the “**Permitted Exceptions**”) and the same shall remain, at all times, Permitted Encumbrances and shall be deemed approved by Purchaser. If Purchaser does not give such notice, such failure shall be conclusively deemed to be full and complete approval of the Title Commitment and the Survey, and any matter disclosed therein. If Purchaser does give such notice, Seller shall have three (3) days after receipt thereof to notify Purchaser in writing that Seller (a) will cause or (b) elects not to cause any or all of the Title Objections disclosed therein to be removed or insured over by the Title Company. Seller’s failure to notify Purchaser within such three (3) day period as to any Title Objection shall be deemed an election by Seller not to remove or have the Title Company insure over such Title Objection. If Seller notifies or is deemed to have notified Purchaser that Seller shall not remove nor have the Title Company insure over any or all of the Title Objections, Purchaser shall have until the end of the Investigation Period to (i) terminate this Agreement or (ii) waive such Title Objections and proceed to Closing without any abatement or reduction in the Purchase Price on account of such Title Objections. If Purchaser does not give such notice within said period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to waive such Title Objections. 

5.3.2. **General Investigation**. In addition, Purchaser shall have until 5:00 p.m. (New York Time) on the business day which is thirty (30) days following the Effective Date (the “**Investigation Period**”) to notify Seller that, as a result of Purchaser’s review of any documents (other than the Title Report or the Survey) or Purchaser’s investigation of the Property, it disapproves of any matter or item affecting the Property and terminates this Agreement. If Purchaser fails to give such notice of disapproval and termination with respect to any matter relating to the Property prior to the expiration of the Investigation Period, such failure shall be conclusively deemed to be full and complete approval of such matters and a satisfaction of this condition. 

^^Effect of Termination. If Purchaser terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.3, then subject to Section 5.2, all further rights and obligations of the parties shall cease and terminate without any further liability of either party to the other (except those obligations which are specifically provided to survive such termination as provided in this Agreement) and the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser. 

^^No Obligation to Cure. Nothing contained in this Agreement or otherwise shall require Seller to render its title marketable or to remove or correct any exception or matter disapproved by Purchaser or to spend any money or incur any expense in order to do so. 

^^Copies of Third Party Reports. If the Investigation Period is extended for any reason, including by amendment to this Agreement, or if Seller otherwise requests, Purchaser, within three (3) days after such extension or request, shall provide Seller with copies of all third party reports and work product generated with respect to the Property. 

\centered **THE CLOSING** 

^^Date and Manner of Closing. Seller, Purchaser and Title Agent shall close the escrow and the transaction contemplated herein (the “**Closing**”) as soon as all conditions to closing contained in this Agreement have been satisfied (or deemed satisfied) or waived in writing which shall in any event be not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York Time) on [[Date 1: Date]] (the “**Closing Date**”), time being of the essence (subject only to Seller’s express rights of remedy or cure provided herein, in which event Seller will give Purchaser not less than three (3) business days notice of the date of Closing), by recording and delivering all documents and funds as set forth in Article VII. 

\centered **PRORATION, FEES, COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS** 

^^Prorations. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall determine the amounts of the prorations in accordance with this Agreement and notify Purchaser thereof. Purchaser shall review and approve such determination promptly and prior to the Closing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Thereafter, Purchaser and Seller shall each inform Title Agent of such amounts. 

7.1.1. **Certain Items Prorated**. In accordance with the notifications, Title Agent shall prorate between the parties (and the parties shall deposit funds therefor with Title Agent or shall instruct Title Agent to debit against sums held by Title Agent owing to such party), as of 11:59 p.m. of the day prior to the Closing, all income and expenses with respect to the Property and payable to or by the owner of the Property, including, without limitation: (i) all real property taxes and assessments on the basis of the fiscal period for which assessed (if the Closing shall occur before the tax rate is fixed, the apportionment of taxes shall be based on the tax rate for the preceding period applied to an amount equal to the gross Purchase Price, and after the Closing, when the actual real property taxes are finally fixed, Seller and Purchaser shall make a recalculation of such proration, and the appropriate party shall make the applicable payment reflecting the recalculation to the other party); (ii) rents and other tenant payments and tenant reimbursements (collectively, “**Tenant Payments**”) if any, received under the Leases, subject to Section 7.1.5 below; (iii) charges for water, sewer, electricity, gas, fuel and other utility charges, all of which shall be read promptly before Closing, unless Seller elects to close its own applicable account, in which event Purchaser shall open its own account and the respective charges shall not be prorated; (iv) amounts prepaid and amounts accrued but unpaid on service contracts and management contracts which are to be assumed by Purchaser; and (v) periodic fees for licenses, permits or other authorizations with respect to the Property. The obligation of the parties to recalculate the proration of taxes shall survive the Closing. 

7.1.2. **Leasing Commissions**. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay or reimburse Seller for all leasing commissions, tenant improvement costs and allowances, tenant concessions, and other charges payable by reason of or in connection with any Lease entered into after the Effective Date, any renewal or extension of an existing Lease after such date, and any new lease referred to in Section 13.4. Purchaser shall be and remain responsible for any leasing commissions, tenant improvement costs and allowances, tenant concessions and other charges payable for any renewal, extension or other option under any existing or future lease. For Leases executed prior to the Effective Date, Seller shall only be responsible for those leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs which are due and owing at Closing under the terms and conditions of the Leases as of the Effective Date and are associated with the initial occupancy of the tenants under such Leases. 

7.1.3. **Taxes**. 

^Real property tax refunds and credits received after the Closing which are attributable to a fiscal tax year prior to the Closing shall belong to Seller. Any such refunds and credits attributable to the fiscal tax year during which the Closing occurs shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser after deducting the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of collection thereof. This apportionment obligation shall survive the Closing.

^^Other Duties of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be bound in any way by any other agreement or contract between Seller and Purchaser, whether or not Escrow Agent has knowledge thereof. Escrow Agent’s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Deposit shall be to hold the Deposit and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Deposit and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Deposit and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Deposit or for any diminution in value of the Deposit from any cause, other than Escrow Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Escrow Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Purchaser, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants. Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Escrow Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Escrow Agent. 

^^Disputes. Escrow Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Deposit. If there is any dispute as to whether Escrow Agent is obligated to deliver the Deposit or as to whom the Deposit is to be delivered, Escrow Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Deposit until receipt by Escrow Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Deposit, or, in the absence of authorization, Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding. Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity or validity of any notice, instruction, instrument, document or other item delivered to it, and it shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written notice, direction or instruction given to it under this Agreement and believed by it to be authentic. If written authorization is not given, or proceedings for a determination are not begun, within thirty (30) days after the date scheduled for the closing of title and diligently continued, Escrow Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the Deposit with a court of the State in which the Property is located pending a determination. Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and disbursements incurred in its capacity as Escrow Agent, by the party determined not to be entitled to the Deposit. Upon making delivery of the Deposit in the manner provided in this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall have no further liability hereunder. In no event shall Escrow Agent be under any duty to institute, defend or participate in any proceeding that may arise between Seller and Purchaser in connection with the Deposit. The parties acknowledge that Escrow Agent also represents Seller and in the event of any dispute between Seller and Purchaser, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Escrow Agent may represent Seller with respect to any disputes with respect to this Agreement or other matters, and Purchaser agrees that Escrow Agent shall not be disqualified or prevented from representing Seller by virtue of its capacity of Escrow Agent. The provisions of this Section 16.20 shall survive Closing. 

^^Reports. Escrow Agent shall be responsible for the timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 

^^Radon Notice. As required by Section 404.056(7), Florida Statutes, the following notification is made regarding radon gas: 

RADON GAS: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it has accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida. Additional information regarding radon and radon testing may be obtained from your county public health unit. 

^^Brokers. The parties each represent and warrant to the other that the only real estate brokers, salesmen or finders involved in this transaction are CB Richard Ellis, Inc. (the “**Seller Broker**”) and Boardwalk Company (the “**Purchaser Broker**”)(Seller Broker and Purchaser Broker may be collectively referred to herein as the “**Broker**”), pursuant to the terms of separate written agreements between (i) Seller and Seller Broker and (ii) Seller Broker and 

Purchaser Broker. If a claim for brokerage or similar fees in connection with this transaction is made by any broker, salesman or finder other than Broker claiming to have dealt through or on behalf of one of the parties to this Agreement, then that party shall indemnify, defend and hold the other party under this Agreement harmless from all liabilities, damages, claims, costs, fees and expenses whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, including those for appellate matters and post judgment proceedings) with respect to said claim for brokerage. Seller shall be responsible for causing Seller Broker to deliver to Escrow Agent prior to Closing a conditional lien waiver for all fees due Seller Broker at Closing in connection with this Agreement, with such waiver only conditioned upon Seller Broker’s receipt of brokerage fees in the amount payable to Seller Broker as set forth on the Closing Statement (the “**Seller Broker Lien Waiver**”). Purchaser shall be responsible for causing Purchaser Broker to deliver to Escrow Agent prior to Closing a conditional lien waiver for all fees due Purchaser Broker at Closing in connection with this Agreement, with such waiver only conditioned upon Purchaser Broker’s receipt of brokerage fees in the amount payable to Purchaser Broker as set forth on the Closing Statement (the “**Purchaser Broker Lien Waiver**”). The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement. 

^^Contribution to New Entity. Purchaser and Seller agree that Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to form a new Florida limited liability company (“Newco”) immediately prior to the Closing Date for the purpose of taking title to the Property at Closing. As of the Closing Date, Newco will be wholly owned by Seller. Prior to Closing, Seller will transfer the Property to Newco in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if Newco were the Purchaser hereunder; provided, however, that Purchaser shall remain obligated to pay the Purchase Price at Closing. At Closing, Newco shall assume all of the rights, duties and obligations of Purchaser under the Agreement (other than the obligation to pay the Purchase Price which remains with the Purchaser). At Closing (but after such transfer), Seller shall assign and transfer all of the membership units in Newco to Purchaser so that Purchaser is the sole owner of Newco pursuant to that membership unit power attached as **Exhibit L**, in consideration for receipt of the Purchase Price, and the other obligations and duties set forth in this Agreement. Seller represents that as of the Closing Date Seller will own all of the membership units in Newco, such units shall be unencumbered and that immediately prior to the transfer of the membership units, Newco shall have no liabilities, duties or obligations to any third party except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its affiliates, members, partners, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, directors, employees and agents from any loss, injury, damage, cause of action, liability, claim, lien, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising from any liabilities, duties or obligations of Newco that are in existence prior to the transfer of the membership units, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that Seller shall expressly not be liable for any liabilities, duties or obligations of Newco which (i) arise or are incurred by Newco after the transfer of the membership units to Purchaser or (ii) are set forth in this Agreement and are assumed by Newco at Closing. Seller shall be responsible for (i) the payment of documentary deed stamps incurred in such transfer of membership units, and (ii) filing the appropriate documentation with the Florida Department of Revenue and the local property appraiser’s office in connection with such transfer of membership units and (iii) any other additional costs associated with performing the transfer as stated in this Section 16.24.
