^^Completion of Payments. Subject to this Section 5.02(d), PII shall only be obligated to pay the Milestone Payments under Section 5.02(a), 5.02(b) and 5.02(c) once. For clarity, except as expressly provided below, once PII makes the Milestone Payment under either Section 5.02(a), 5.02(b) or 5.02(c) relating to the Development Plan, PII shall have no further obligation to make any further Milestone Payments under Section 5.02(a), 5.02(b) or 5.02(c) to RBX for any future occurrence of such milestone event relating to another program for the Development of the Compound for the Indication.

^**Royalties.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PII shall pay to RBX a royalty in the amount of **[*]** percent (**[*]**%) of Net Sales of each Licensed Product in the Territory commencing with the First Commercial Sale of the first Licensed Product. 

^**Royalty Period.** PII’s obligation to pay royalties to RBX under Section 5.04 shall apply on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis and shall begin, on a country by country basis, upon the date of the First Commercial Sale in such country of such Licensed Product and shall end upon termination of sale of the Licensed Product in such country. 

^**Payments to Third Parties.** In the event PPD determines that it is necessary or desirable to seek a license or immunity from suit from any Third Party in order for PPD to exercise its rights hereunder to Develop, manufacture, commercialize, use or exploit the Compound or a Licensed Product in a particular country of the Territory, PPD shall obtain any such license or immunity from suit. Any upfront payment, milestone, royalty or other payment paid or payable by PPD to a Third Party in consideration for immunity from or license to such Third Party’s intellectual property rights with respect to the Compound or a Licensed Product shall be solely for PPD’s account and RBX shall have no liability (including, without limitation, any indemnity obligation) for any such amounts. 

^^**Method of Calculation.** The calculation of the amount of royalties due under the provisions of Section 5.04 shall be subject to and computed in accordance with the following provisions: 

^^Frequency. Royalties shall be calculated and paid on a calendar quarter basis. PII shall provide RBX with a statement of royalties owed to RBX within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter and the quarterly royalty payment shall be made at the time of such statement. Each of the quarterly statement of royalties and the annual statement provided in the following sentence shall show in reasonably specific detail, on a country-by-country basis (i) the total number of units of each of the Licensed Products sold, (ii) the Net Sales on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis (including the detailed calculation of the deductions from gross sales of each of the Licensed Products in arriving at Net Sales); (iii) the calculation of the royalties payable pursuant to Section 5.04 in United States dollars which had been accrued hereunder based upon Net Sales of each Licensed Product, including a detailed calculation showing the application of the applicable royalty rates under Section 5.04 to the aggregate Net Sales for all Licensed Products; (iv) the withholding taxes, if any, required by law to be deducted with respect to such royalties and the amounts paid to the appropriate governmental authority with respect to such royalties; (v) the date of the first Commercial Sale of each Licensed Product in each country in the Territory during the reporting period; and (vi) the exchange rates used in determining the amount of United States dollars. In addition, at the end of each calendar year, aggregate royalties for such calendar year shall be calculated on aggregate Net Sales for all Licensed Products for such calendar year to determine additional royalty payments owed to RBX by PII. Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year, PII shall provide RBX with a statement of such additional aggregate royalty payments owed to RBX and a written report showing the method by which the royalty payments for such calendar year were calculated, including a breakdown of gross sales and Net Sales for each Licensed Product sold, including any exchange rates used. If there are no sales of Licensed Product in a country in a given year, 

[*]   Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC. then no statement for such country shall be included in such yearly report. PII shall submit any additional aggregate royalty payments to RBX together with such statement and written report. With respect to sales of any Licensed Products invoiced in United States dollars, the Net Sales and royalties and other payments payable hereunder shall be expressed in United States Dollars. With respect to sales of any Licensed Products invoiced in a currency other than United States Dollars, the Net Sales and royalties and other payments payable hereunder with respect to such Licensed Products shall be expressed in the domestic currency of the party making the sale together with the United States dollar equivalent of the royalty payment payable, and such exchange rate shall be calculated pursuant to Section 6.03. 

^^Combination Products. PII shall pay RBX royalties on Net Sales of any Combination Product. For the purpose of calculating royalties on Net Sales of Combination Products hereunder, Net Sales of a Combination Product shall be determined on a country by country basis by multiplying the actual Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction A/(A+B), where A is the average sale price of a Licensed Product in a given country when sold separately in finished form and B is the average sale price of the other product(s) comprising the active ingredients other than the Compound sold separately in finished form in that given country. With respect to Net Sales of Combination Products outside of the United States, where available in a given country, the most recent reference price(s) or government-regulated price(s) for the other product(s) in the given country will be used as the average sale price. In the event that such average sale price cannot be determined for either the Licensed Product or other product(s) in the Combination Product, Net Sales for purposes of determining royalty payments hereunder shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction C/(C+D), where C is PII’s, or its Affiliates’, sublicensees’ or Third Party Partner’s cost of goods of the Licensed Product and D is PII’s, or its Affiliates’, sublicensees’ or Third Party Partner’s cost of goods of the other product(s), in each case determined in accordance with GAAP. 

^^Royalty and Patents**.** Regardless of the number of patents that cover a Licensed Product, only one royalty shall be payable upon sale of a Licensed Product. 

^^Other Consideration. In the case of a sale or other disposal of Licensed Product for value other than in an arm’s-length transaction exclusively for money, such as barter or counter-trade, the amount of such sale shall be calculated using the fair market value of such Licensed Product (if higher than the stated sales price) in the country of disposition. 

^**Books and Records.** PII shall keep and shall require any Affiliates, sublicensees and Third Party Partner selling any Licensed Product to keep proper records and books of account, in accordance with GAAP, showing the Net Sales of each Licensed Product upon which the royalty payments and Sales Milestone Payments of PII are based, and all other information necessary for the accurate determination of royalty payments to be made hereunder. 

^**Audit.** On reasonable written notice RBX, at its own expense, shall have the right, no more than once a calendar year, to have an independent certified public accountant inspect and audit the books and records of PII, its Affiliates, any sublicensees and Third Party Partner, including any Net Sales reports received from its Affiliates, its sublicensees and its Third Party Partner, during usual business hours for the sole purpose of, and only to the extent necessary for, determining the correctness of royalty payments due under this Agreement. Such examination with respect to any fiscal period shall not take place later than three years following the expiration of such period, after which royalty payments made for such fiscal periods shall be final and binding. The expense of any such audit shall be borne by RBX; provided, however, that, if the audit with respect to a particular calendar year discloses an error in excess of five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) in favor of the PII, then PII shall pay, in addition to the amount of any underpayment, the cost of the audit. PII shall include substantially the same audit rights in any sublicense it grants in order to ensure correctness of payments due hereunder. 

^**Foreign Payments.** All payments due hereunder shall be paid in U.S. dollars, including, without limitation, royalties on Net Sales outside of the U.S. Dollar amounts shall be calculated in the foreign currency for the country in which sales are recorded and will be translated into U.S. dollars based on the average of the average daily exchange rates for such calendar quarter as published by the Wall Street Journal for the quarter for which such payments are due. Payments in U.S. dollars shall be paid by wire transfer to RBX. 

^**Ownership of Patents.** 

Inventorship of inventions conceived or reduced to practice in the course of the activities under the Development Plan shall be determined by reference to United States laws pertaining to inventorship. If inventions are conceived or reduced to practice in the course of activities under the Development Plan by an individual obliged to assign patent rights to RBX and an individual obliged to assign patent rights to PII, it shall be jointly owned (“Joint Invention”), and if one or more claims included in any issued Patent or pending Patent application which is filed in a patent office in the Territory claim such Joint Invention, such claims shall be jointly owned (“Joint Patent Rights”). Subject to Section 3.01, during the term of this Agreement, the Parties shall not use or grant any rights under, or otherwise commercialize any Joint Patent Rights or any Joint Invention, and the Parties shall not disclose any Joint Invention to any third Party (except to the extent each Party would be permitted to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to Article IX) without obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party or without mutually agreeing in writing upon terms and condition, including a royalty or other compensation to the other Party. After the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Parties may use or grant any rights under, or otherwise commercialize, any Joint Patent Rights or any Joint Invention in the Territory, and the Parties may disclose any Joint Invention to any Third Party, all without obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party and without any accounting obligations. If an invention is solely conceived or reduced to practice in the course of activities under the Project by an employee, consultant or agent of a Party, it shall be solely owned by such Party, and any Patent filed claiming such solely owned invention shall also be solely owned by such Party. 

^**Ownership of PII Information.** PII shall own the entire right, title and interest in and to any and all PII Information. 

^^**Patent Prosecution.** 

^^PII shall have the right and obligation to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of RBX Patents. PII shall control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of patent applications directed to Joint Patent Rights. (“Joint Patents”).

RBX shall provide PII any reasonable assistance required to perfect the RBX Patent Rights and RBX shall provide PII reasonable assistance required to perfect the Joint Patent Rights. PII shall provide RBX with drafts of all proposed patent filings (including, without limitation, patent applications, amendments and responses to official actions) at least thirty (30) days before filing and shall take into account any comments provided by RBX to PII, to the extent reasonable, within thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as shall be required to meet a filing deadline, but in no event less than fifteen (15) days) after RBX’s receipt of the applicable draft. If PII decides not to file or maintain any RBX Patent on a country-by-country basis or patent family basis, PII shall give RBX reasonable notice of same and after receipt of such notice, RBX may, at its expense, file or maintain such applications or patents at its own expense. PII shall provide RBX with drafts of all proposed patent filings relating to the Joint Patents (including, without limitation, patent applications, amendments and responses to official actions) at least thirty (30) days before filing and shall take into account any comments provided by RBX to PII, to the extent reasonable, within thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as shall be required to meet a filing deadline, but in no event less than fifteen (15) days) after RBX’s receipt of the applicable draft.

RBX shall provide PII any reasonable assistance required to perfect the rights defined in Section 7.01. Subject to the last sentence in this Section 7.03(b), if PII decides not to file or maintain any PII Patents on a country-by-country basis or patent family basis, PII shall give RBX reasonable notice of same and after receipt of such notice, RBX may, at its expense, file or maintain such applications or patents at its own expense, and PII shall assign such patents and patent applications to RBX that RBX elects to file or maintain. The previous sentence shall not apply to any decision of PII that is based on its determination, in its sole discretion, that the value of a particular PII invention will most likely be maximized by a form of intellectual property protection other than patent protection, or that a particular filing would detract from the overall value of the patent estate. 

^^[*] shall be responsible for all patent costs (including filing fees, maintenance fees, and outside attorney fees) with respect to each Patent within the RBX Patents and Joint Patents that covers the composition of matter, manufacture or use of the Compound. 

^**Notification.** PII shall provide a written report to RBX every second calendar quarter summarizing the status of all RBX Patents and Joint Patents. Such report shall constitute Confidential Information under Article IX. 

^**Trademarks.** PII shall own all trademarks developed by PII used to identify a Licensed Product. 

^**Infringement of Patent Rights.** Each party to this Agreement shall notify the other in writing promptly of any actual, potential or suspected infringement (collectively “alleged infringement”) of the RBX Patents, Joint Patents or PII Patents of which such Party becomes aware and shall promptly provide the other Party with available evidence of such alleged infringement. PII shall have the first right to take whatever action it deems appropriate to enforce the RBX Patents, Joint Patents or PII Patents, at its sole cost and expense. If PII does not, within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice of alleged infringement take any action, or file any suit to enforce the RBX Patents, Joint Patents and PII Patents against such infringing party in a country in the Territory, RBX may in its discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, filing suit against any such infringing party. If RBX elects to enforce the RBX Patents, RBX shall use good faith efforts in any such proceeding against infringers, shall consult with PII during said enforcement and shall solicit PII’s advice with respect to such enforcement. Regardless of which Party controls any such enforcement action, RBX and PII shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the planning and execution of any action to enforce the RBX Patents, Joint Patents and PII Patents. The Party controlling any such enforcement action may not settle or consent to an adverse judgment without the express written consent of the non-controlling Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any damages or other amounts collected with respect to such action will first be used to reimburse each of the Parties, on a pro rata basis, for its out of pocket costs and expenses; and then, any remaining amount will be distributed **[*]**% to the Party controlling the enforcement action and **[*]**% to the other Party. 

^**Patent Marking.** To the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, PII agrees to mark, and to cause any Affiliate, sublicense or Third Party Partner to mark, PII’s Licensed Products (through a marking on containers, packaging or labels, or an Orange Book or like listing) made, sold, or otherwise disposed of by it or them with any notice of patent rights necessary or desirable under applicable law to enable patent rights to be enforced to their full extent in any country where such Licensed Products are to be sold.

^**Material Breach.** This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon the material default of this Agreement by the other Party. In the event of such material default by a Party (“Defaulting Party”), the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall give the Defaulting Party written notice of the default and its election to terminate this Agreement at the expiration of a cure period of twenty (20) days for payment default and thirty (30) days for non-payment defaults from the date of the notice. If the Defaulting Party fails to cure the default within the applicable grace period, or if such default is incapable of being cured within such grace period (expressly excluding payment defaults) and the Defaulting Party has failed within such period to take actions that are reasonably likely to cure such default, provided that in no event shall such default continue beyond one hundred fifty (150) days, then the Non-Defaulting Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Defaulting Party. The termination will be effective upon Defaulting Party’s receipt of such termination notice. All termination rights shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies that may be available to the Non-Defaulting Party. Termination pursuant to this section will not relieve the Defaulting Party from liability and damages to the Non-Defaulting Party for default. Waiver by either Party of a single default or a succession of defaults will not deprive such Party of any right to terminate this Agreement arising by reason of any subsequent default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PII shall not be considered in material default under this Agreement if such material default results from a Licensed Product Manufacturing Failure. 

^**Termination for Failure to Meet Key Development Milestones**. RBX may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to PII in the event that any one or more of the following milestones have not been achieved within six (6) months of the date corresponding to such milestone as follows:

PII shall use Diligent Efforts to achieve each of the Milestones provided above as soon as practicable and shall, in the event of a delay, provide RBX detailed information on a monthly basis describing the reason for the delay, the actions being taken to overcome the delay and the estimated time to complete the delayed Milestone. 

^**Termination for Insolvency/Bankruptcy.** It either PII or RBX (i) makes a general assignment for the benefit or creditors or becomes insolvent; (ii) files an insolvency petition in bankruptcy; (iii) petitions for or acquiesces in the appointment of any receiver, trustee or similar officer to liquidate or conserve its business or a substantial part of its assets; (iv) commences under the laws of any jurisdiction any proceeding involving its insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, adjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or any other similar proceedings for the release of financially distressed debtors; or (v) becomes a party to any proceeding or action of the type described in (iii) or (iv) and such proceeding or action remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than sixty (60) days, then the other party may by written notice terminate this Agreement in its entirety with immediate effect.
