\centered **RECITALS** 

**WHEREAS**, [[Organization 3 Name]] and [[Organization 1 Name]] are parties, along with [[Organization 2 Name]], (“Higher One”), to that certain Deposit Withdrawal and Settlement Agreement dated July , 2008 (the “Settlement Agreement”), whereby Higher One will withdraw Higher One Deposits (as defined in the Settlement Agreement) and deposit them with [[Organization 1 Name]]; 

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to Section 11(c) of the Settlement Agreement, [[Organization 1 Name]] has agreed to secure its indemnification obligations to [[Organization 3 Name]] by placing in escrow the sum of $[[USD Value 1]] (the “Escrow Deposit”) with the Escrow Agent; 

**WHEREAS**, the Escrow Deposit shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in this Escrow Agreement; and 

**WHEREAS**, the parties are entering into this Escrow Agreement so as to set forth the terms and conditions regarding the Escrow Agent’s holding of the Escrow Deposit; 

**NOW, THEREFORE**, [[Organization 3 Name]], [[Organization 1 Name]] and the Escrow Agent hereby agree as follows: 

^^Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Settlement Agreement. 

^^On the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement, [[Organization 1 Name]] will deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Deposit, and receipt thereof shall be acknowledged in writing by Escrow Agent. The Escrow Deposit shall be held by the Escrow Agent in the Marshall Prime Money Market Fund Class Y Shares (the “Fund.”) The parties have received a prospectus for the Fund and recognize Escrow Agent or its affiliates may receive investment advisory and other fees from the Fund. Escrow Agent shall reinvest all investment earnings. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Account for federal and state income tax purposes. [[Organization 1 Name]] will report all income, if any, that is earned on the escrow account in such amounts that are properly includible in any taxable year, and pay any taxes attributable thereto. [[Organization 1 Name]] agrees to furnish the Escrow Agent with a completed Form W-9. The Escrow Account shall be distributed as set forth in Section 1.3 of this Escrow Agreement. 

^^The Escrow Deposit shall be disbursed as follows: 

^^As may be directed by [[Organization 3 Name]] and [[Organization 1 Name]] pursuant to a jointly executed written notice to the Escrow Agent. 

^^From time to time for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date under the Settlement Agreement, [[Organization 3 Name]] may submit a notice (an “Indemnity Notice”) to Escrow Agent 

and [[Organization 1 Name]] specifying in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any indemnification claim (a “Claim”) it may have under Section 11(b) of the Settlement Agreement. [[Organization 3 Name]] may make more than one Claim with respect to any underlying set of facts. If [[Organization 1 Name]] delivers written notice to [[Organization 3 Name]] and Escrow Agent that it disputes the Claim described in any Indemnity Notice within fifteen (15) days following receipt by Escrow Agent of the Indemnity Notice regarding such Claim (each such notice, an “Objection Notice”), such Claim shall be resolved as provided in Section 1.4 of this Escrow Agreement. If no Objection Notice is received by [[Organization 3 Name]] and Escrow Agent within such 15-day period, then the amount specified by [[Organization 3 Name]] in such Indemnity Notice shall be deemed established for purposes of this Escrow Agreement and the Settlement Agreement and, at the end of such 15-day period, Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) business days after the expiration of such 15-day period) deliver to [[Organization 3 Name]] for application to such Claim the amount specified in such Indemnity Notice. 

^^If an Objection Notice is given pursuant to Sections 1.3(b) of this Escrow Agreement, Escrow Agent shall make payment with respect thereto only in accordance with (i) joint written instructions of [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 3 Name]], or (ii) a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to a Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent [[Organization 1 Name]] does not dispute a portion of the amount claimed in any Indemnity Notice, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall, in its applicable Objection Notice, authorize Escrow Agent to deliver, and Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) business days after receipt of the applicable Objection Notice) deliver, the undisputed amount. 

^^(a) Twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the “Release Date”), Escrow Agent shall release to [[Organization 1 Name]] the remainder of the Escrow Deposit, if any (the “Release Amount”), save and except for an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding Claims, if any (such Claims being referred to herein as the “Release Claims” and such amount with respect thereto, the “Release Claim Amount”). After the Release Date, the Release Claim Amount shall continue to be held by Escrow Agent until the resolution, on an individual basis, of each of the Release Claims, and shall be distributed by Escrow Agent to [[Organization 1 Name]] or [[Organization 3 Name]], as the case may be, upon resolution of each such Release Claim in the manner described in Section 1.4 of this Escrow Agreement. 

^^Notwithstanding Section 1.5(a) above, if prior to the Release Date [[Organization 3 Name]] has delivered a written notice to [[Organization 1 Name]] and Escrow Agent (i) specifying in reasonable detail the nature of any claim it may have under the Settlement Agreement and (ii) certifying that [[Organization 3 Name]] has reasonably determined in good faith that it is unable to specify the amount of such Claim and that the amount of such Claim could equal or exceed the amount of the Escrow Deposit, then the entire Escrow Deposit shall be included in the Release Claim Amount; 

^^At least two (2) business days prior to any release to be made under this Section 1.5, the Escrow Agent shall send written notice to [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 3 Name]] specifying the amount of such release. 

^^In the event of a dispute arising with respect to the rights of [[Organization 3 Name]] or [[Organization 1 Name]] to receive the Escrow Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to place the Escrow Deposit, as the case may be, into court and commence an action in interpleader in order to obtain a judicial determination as to the party legally entitled to receive such amount. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall be entitled, upon execution of this Escrow Agreement and from time to time thereafter, (a) to receive reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing shall be as described in Schedule 1 attached hereto, and (b) to be reimbursed, upon request, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances, including without limitation reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses incurred or made by it in connection with the performance, modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement. Any such compensation or reimbursements shall be paid by [[Organization 1 Name]]. 

^^Upon receipt of a court order, the Escrow Agent shall act as instructed by such court order. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error in judgment or for any act done or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake of fact or law and is released and exculpated from all liability hereunder, except for willful misconduct. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of any default by [[Organization 3 Name]] or [[Organization 1 Name]] or to take any action, other than as provided in this Escrow Agreement. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability in acting upon any signature, notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt, or other paper or document believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine, and the Escrow Agent may assume that any person purporting to give the Escrow Agent any notice or advice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so, and [[Organization 3 Name]] and [[Organization 1 Name]] each hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against any and all losses, costs, expenses, claims, damages and liabilities, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur as the Escrow Agent hereunder unless caused by the Escrow Agent’s willful refusal or willful failure to act pursuant to the terms hereof. 

^^The Escrow Agent shall not be under any obligation to take any legal action in connection with this Escrow Agreement or towards its enforcement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any action or legal proceeding that, in the opinion of the Escrow Agent, would or might involve the Escrow Agent in any cost, expense, loss or liability unless, and as often as required by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be furnished with security and indemnity satisfactory to the Escrow Agent against all such costs, expenses, losses or liability. 

^^Any notice given to any party hereto shall be in writing and simultaneously shall be sent to the other parties hereto.
