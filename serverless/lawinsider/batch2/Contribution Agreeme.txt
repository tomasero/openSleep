\centered **Contribution Agreement and Cash Collateral Security Agreement**

This Contribution Agreement and Cash Collateral Security Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of this [[Date 1: Date]] by and among [[Shareholder]], individually (the “Shareholder”), [[Borrower]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Borrower”), and [[Administrative Agent]], an [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]], as Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the “Administrative Agent”).

\centered **Background**

^The Borrower, the Lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent are party to a Credit Agreement dated as of [[Date 2: Date]] (such Credit Agreement, as heretofore amended and as the same may further be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”).

^The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have agreed, among other things, to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in the Second Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement dated on or about the date hereof (the “Second Amendment”), among the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.

^As a condition to entering into the Second Amendment and continuing to extend credit and other financial obligations to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders require, among other things, that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement.

^As a significant shareholder of the Borrower, the Shareholder benefits directly and indirectly from the continued extension of credit and other financial accommodations to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and is therefore agreeable to executing and delivering this Agreement. 

^Until the Borrower meets certain financial tests as further described herein, the Shareholder has agreed to provide cash collateral and/or a standby letter of credit, in an aggregate amount of no less than $[[USD Value 1: Number]] to the Administrative Agent as collateral security for the Shareholder’s obligations under the terms of and pursuant to the conditions of this Agreement.

Now, Therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:

Section 1. Definitions. All capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms on Exhibit A attached hereto.

Section 2. Cash Collateral Account and Standby L/C. (a) On or before the date hereof, the Shareholder shall have:

^^^Established with the Administrative Agent a deposit account numbered 7024701760 (including any successor, replacement or substitute accounts therefor maintained with the Administrative Agent by the Shareholder, the “Cash Collateral Account”), and deposited into the Cash Collateral Account, cash in an amount greater than or equal to the Minimum Cash Collateral Amount; and

^^^Delivered to the Administrative Agent a standby letter of credit in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders (the “Standby L/C”), which Standby L/C shall be in a face amount of greater than or equal to the Minimum L/C Amount, issued by a financial institution acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and in a form and with drawing conditions and other terms acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower shall neither be directly or contingently obligated to reimburse any draws made on the Standby L/C nor be directly or contingently obligated to pay any fees or expenses with respect to the Standby L/C. 

^^The Shareholder may at any time after the date hereof (i) increase or decrease the amount of cash held in the Cash Collateral Account (the “Cash Collateral Amount”) and (ii) increase or decrease the face amount of the Standby L/C (the “L/C Amount”) so long as the sum of the Cash Collateral Amount and the L/C Amount shall at all times equal or exceed $[[USD Value 2: Number]] less the sum of all amounts received by the Administrative Agent in respect of Cash Collateral Draws and L/C Draws.

^^The Cash Collateral Account is and shall be a blocked account of the Shareholder under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, and the Shareholder may not make nor direct any withdrawals, transfers or other dispositions from the Cash Collateral Account. The Cash Collateral Account shall hold funds to satisfy the obligations of the Shareholder set forth herein and the Administrative Agent shall at all times have a first priority perfected security interest in such account. The Cash Collateral Account may be an interest bearing account, with interest accruing at a rate at least equal to that of similar deposit accounts of a similar size held at [[Administrative Agent]], an Ohio banking corporation. The Shareholder hereby directs the Administrative Agent to deposit all interest proceeds into the Cash Collateral Account.

Section 3. Maintenance Obligation. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that upon the occurrence of any Make-Well Violation, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, without any further direction or instruction from or consent of the Shareholder:

^^^Withdraw cash from the Cash Collateral Account in an amount up to the lesser of (x) the remaining amount therein and (y) the Make-Well Amount (each such withdrawal, a “Cash Collateral Draw”); and

^^^Submit a draw request with respect to the Standby L/C in an amount up to the lesser of (x) the remaining undrawn amount of the Standby L/C and (y) the Make-Well Amount (each such draw, an “L/C Draw”).

; provided, that, with respect to any Make-Well Violation, the sum of any Cash Collateral Draw and any L/C Draw related thereto shall not exceed the Make-Well Amount therefor; and provided further that, to the extent any minimum required draw amount set forth in the Standby L/C (the “Required Draw Amount”) exceeds the amount the Administrative Agent may otherwise request in connection with a Make-Well Violation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the “Permitted Amount”), the Administrative Agent may submit a draw request with respect to the Standby L/C in an amount equal to the Required Draw Amount and the Administrative Agent shall deposit into the Cash Collateral Account that amount of proceeds from such draw that is equal to the difference between the Required Draw Amount and the Permitted Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Borrower has not extended the maturity date of the Standby L/C or delivered a replacement standby letter of credit to the Administrative Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of the Standby L/C, the Administrative Agent may, on the expiration date of the Standby L/C, submit a draw request with respect to the Standby L/C in an amount equal to the undrawn amount of the Standby L/C and the Administrative Agent shall deposit all proceeds from such draw into the Cash Collateral Account.

^^The proceeds of each Cash Collateral Draw and each L/C Draw shall be deemed to be a Subordinated Loan made by the Shareholder to the Borrower under the Subordinated Note; provided that, the aggregate amount of the Subordinated Loans made by the Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement shall in no event exceed $[[USD Value 3: Number]]

^^The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees with the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders that its obligations hereunder are absolute and unconditional, that he has no defense, offset or counterclaim to his obligations to make payments under this Agreement, all of which are hereby waived, and that he will make all payments due by him hereunder notwithstanding the existence of any such defense, offset or counterclaim and without any reduction of any nature whatsoever.

^^The Payee represents and warrants that the Payee has no lien on or security interest in any assets of the Maker and will not accept any such lien or security interest so long as any Superior Indebtedness shall remain outstanding and unpaid or the Senior Lenders have any obligations to extend credit to the Maker.

The Payee consents to the creation and continuance of all present and future liens and security interests of the Administrative Agent in the Collateral to secure the Superior Indebtedness and to the enforcement of those liens and security interests, including the removal of the Collateral from the real property of the Maker. This subordination as to the Collateral is intended to define the rights and duties of the Administrative Agent and the Payee; it is not intended that any third party shall benefit from it. If the effect of any provision of this Note would be to give any third party a priority status to which that party would not otherwise be entitled, that provision shall, to the extent necessary to avoid that priority, be given no effect and the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent and the Payee shall be determined in accordance with applicable law.

^^If notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Payee shall receive any payment of principal or interest on Subordinated Indebtedness which the Maker is not entitled to make pursuant to the terms hereof, whether or not the Payee has knowledge that the Maker is not entitled to make such payment, the Payee shall promptly account for such payment and upon the Administrative Agent’s demand pay over such payment to the Administrative Agent for application to the Superior Indebtedness owing to the Senior Lenders. No payment or any distribution received by the Administrative Agent in respect of Subordinated Indebtedness pursuant to any of the terms hereof shall entitle the Payee to any right, whether by virtue of subrogation or otherwise, in and to any Superior Indebtedness unless and until all Superior Indebtedness owing to the Senior Lenders has been fully paid and satisfied and the Senior Lenders obligations, if any, to extend credit to the Maker have expired or otherwise been terminated.

^Prepayment. The Maker has the right to prepay, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, the unpaid principal amount (or any portion thereof) of this Note and accrued interest on such amount (i) if consented to in writing by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or (ii) at any time after the payment in full in cash of all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the termination of the Credit Agreement.

^Successors and Assigns. This Note will bind the Maker and its successors and assigns, and the benefits of this Note will inure to the benefit of the Payee and its successors and assigns. The Payee may not assign all or any portion of its rights or obligations under this Note. Furthermore, this Note may not be assigned by the Maker without the prior written consent of the other party. All references herein to the “Maker” and the “Payee” are deemed to apply to the Maker and the Payee, respectively, and to their respective successors and assigns.

^Interest Rate Limitation. Nothing contained in this Note or any transaction related to this Note, will be construed or so operate as to require the Maker to pay interest at a greater rate than is now lawful or in such case to contract for, or to make any payment, or to do any act contrary to applicable law. Should any interest or other charges paid by the Maker, or parties liable for the payment of this Note, in connection with the indebtedness evidenced by this Note or any other document delivered in connection with this Note, result in the computation or earning of interest in excess of the maximum legal rate of interest that is legally permitted under applicable law, then any and all such excess will be, and the same hereby is, waived by the Payee, and any and all such excess will be automatically credited against and in reduction of the balance due under this Note, and the portion of said excess that exceeds the balance due under this Note shall be paid by the Payee to the Maker.

^Failure to Make Payments. If the Maker is not able to perform any of its obligations under this Note because, in the judgment of the board of directors of the Maker, based on the advice of counsel, such performance would violate applicable statutes, the by-laws or the articles of incorporation of the Maker, any agreement to which the Maker is a party or any rule, regulation, decree or order to which the Maker is subject, the Maker will take all commercially reasonable action (including, without limitation, seeking waivers, consents and approvals and making partial payments to the extent permitted) to fulfill its obligations as soon as practicable. The Maker shall not voluntarily amend its by-laws or articles of incorporation or enter into any agreement with the intent or result of avoiding its obligations under this Note.

^Governing Law and Severability. The provisions of this Note will be construed according to the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to conflict of laws principles. If any provision of this Note is in conflict with any statute or rule of law of the State of Ohio or is otherwise unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then such provision will be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity and will be deemed separable from and will not invalidate any other provision of this Note.
