^^By QLT.

^Term and Termination.  
^^The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall terminate on [[Date 3: Date]], unless sooner terminated under the terms of this Agreement. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent terms of one additional year, unless either party provides the other party with written notice of its intent not to renew this Agreement at least 120 days before expiration of the current Term. 

^^Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause, upon 30 days’ written notice of a material default to the other party with a reason for termination, and failure of that party to cure the default within the 30 day period. After the conclusion of the first year of the Term, either party may terminate this Agreement at will upon at least 120 days’ prior written notice to the other party.

^^Either party may immediately terminate this Agreement on written notice to the other party in the event of a change in law that would make this Agreement unlawful.

**21.5.1** If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Distributor following an uncured material breach by QLT or (ii) by QLT at will, then at Distributor’s option exercised in writing within **[*]** after a party receives notice of such termination from the terminating party, QLT shall promptly **[*]**, at **[*]**.

**[*]**    **Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.**

^^^^^ 
^Miscellaneous.  
^^No waiver of any breach of any one or more of the conditions or covenants of this Agreement by a party shall be deemed to imply or constitute a waiver of a breach of the same condition or covenant in the future, or a waiver of a breach of any other condition or covenant of this Agreement. 

^^If any provision or the scope of any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or too broad by judicial decree, the parties agree that such provisions shall be curtailed only to the extent necessary to conform to law to permit enforcement of this Agreement to its full extent. 

^^Each of the parties agrees and acknowledges that this Agreement, including the attachments referred to herein and the NDA, (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (ii) is not intended to confer any rights or remedies, or impose any obligations, on any person other than the parties hereto. Each of the parties expressly agrees and acknowledges that, other than those statements expressly set forth in this Agreement, it is not relying on any statement, whether oral or written, of any person or entity with respect to its entry into this Agreement or to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of the parties further waives any claim against the other party that such other party has failed to disclose any fact, occurrence or other matter that relates in any way to its entry into this Agreement. 

^^This Agreement may be modified only by a written agreement signed by both parties. 

^^This Agreement may be assigned by Distributor to any affiliate but may not be otherwise assigned without the consent of QLT, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of this Agreement, “affiliate” means any company or person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the referenced party, as the case may be. This Agreement may be assigned by QLT without the consent of Distributor to an affiliate, to any entity with whom it may merge or amalgamate or to any entity acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of QLT to which this Agreement relates, but may not otherwise be assigned without the consent of Distributor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Any permitted assignee shall assume all obligations of its assignor under this Agreement. No assignment shall relieve either party of responsibility for the performance of any accrued obligations which such party then has under this Agreement. 

^^This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement will be construed and interpreted under the internal laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict and choice of law principles. Both parties hereby waive their right to a trial by jury and, therefore, all disputes and conflicts regarding this Agreement and the parties’ performance hereunder will be heard before a judge in a court of competent jurisdiction. 

^^Distributor’s relationship with QLT hereunder shall be that of independent contractor, and neither party shall be considered the agent of, partner of, employee or other member of the workforce of, or participant in a joint venture with, the other party, in its performance of all duties under this Agreement. Neither party shall have authority to bind the other party unless otherwise agreed to in writing by such parties.

^^Each party to this Agreement (i) has participated in the preparation of this Agreement, (ii) has read and understands this Agreement, and (iii) has been represented by counsel of its own choice in the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement. Each party represents that this Agreement is executed voluntarily and should not be construed against a party solely because it drafted all or a portion of this Agreement. 

^^This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile execution and delivery of this Agreement are legal, valid and binding execution and delivery for all purposes.
