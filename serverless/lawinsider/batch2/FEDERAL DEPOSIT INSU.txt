^^If all or part of the increase in Leverage Ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital required by paragraph 3 of this ORDER is accomplished by the sale of securities, the Board shall adopt and implement a plan for the sale of such additional securities, including the voting of any shares owned or proxies held or controlled by them in favor of the plan. Should the implementation of the plan involve a public distribution of the Bank’s securities (including a distribution limited only to the Bank’s existing shareholders), the Bank shall prepare offering materials fully describing the securities being offered, including an accurate description of the financial condition of the Bank and the circumstances giving rise to the offering, and any other materials disclosures necessary to comply with Federal securities laws.

^^In complying with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this ORDER, the Bank shall provide to any subscriber and/or purchaser of the Bank’s securities, a written notice of any planned or existing development or other changes, which are materially different from the information reflected in any offering materials used in connection with the sale of Bank securities.
