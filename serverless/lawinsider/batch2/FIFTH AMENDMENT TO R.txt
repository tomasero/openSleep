Subject to the limitations set forth in the next sentence, from and including the date of this Agreement and prior to the Facility Termination Date, each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Advances, to the extent of such Lender’s Commitment, to the applicable Borrowers. Each Lender agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth herein to make Advances to any Borrower in the applicable Agreed Currency from time to time in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate at any one time outstanding its Commitment, provided that (i) the Aggregate Total Outstandings under the Euro Subfacility shall at no time exceed the Euro Subfacility Limit, (ii) the Aggregate Total Outstandings under the Singapore Subfacility shall at no time exceed the Singapore Subfacility Limit, (iii) the Aggregate Total Outstandings under the Hong Kong Subfacility shall at no time exceed the Hong Kong Subfacility Limit, (iv) the Aggregate Total Outstandings under the Japan Subfacility shall at no time exceed the Japan Subfacility Limit and (v) the Aggregate Total Outstandings shall at no time exceed the lesser of (x) the Borrowing Base and (y) the Aggregate Commitment. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, any Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time prior to the Facility Termination Date.

2.2.1 Mandatory Prepayment. (a) If at any time the Aggregate Total Outstandings (calculated as of the most recent Computation Date) exceeds either the Aggregate Commitment or the Borrowing Base, then (A) the US-Borrower shall be obligated to immediately repay Advances under the US Subfacility, and (B) each Non-US Borrower shall be jointly and severally obligated to immediately repay Advances under all Subfacilities, in each case in a principal amount that is, together with any other Borrower’s repayment pursuant to this sentence, sufficient to eliminate any such excess; provided that no Non-US Borrower shall be required to repay any amount to the extent prohibited by applicable law. If at any time (in each case measured as of the most recent Computation Date) (i) the Aggregate Total Outstandings in respect of the Euro Subfacility exceed the Euro Subfacility Limit, (iii) the Aggregate Total Outstandings in respect of the Singapore Subfacility exceed the Singapore Subfacility Limit, (iv) the Aggregate Total Outstandings in respect of the Hong Kong Subfacility exceed the Hong Kong Subfacility Limit, or (v) the Aggregate Total Outstandings under the Japan Subfacility exceed the Japan Subfacility Limit, each Borrower that is a party to such affected Subfacility shall be jointly and severally obligated to repay Advances under the affected Subfacility in an amount or amounts sufficient to eliminate any such excess. Until such time as an excess in an affected Subfacility is so eliminated, the Aggregate Commitment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the excess of such affected Subfacility. 

2.2.2 Voluntary Prepayment. The applicable Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4 but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Advances under its respective Facility, or, in the minimum amount of EUR 1,000,000 or any integral multiples of EUR 100,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Subfacility, the minimum of S$ 1,000,000 or any integral multiples of S$ 100,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Singapore Subfacility, the minimum of H$ 1,000,000 or any integral multiples of H$ 100,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Hong Kong Subfacility, the minimum of JPY 100,000,000 or any integral multiples of JPY 10,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Japan Subfacility and the minimum of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] or any integral multiples of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] in excess thereof in the case of the US Facility (except that prepayments may be made in the minimum amount of $[[USD Value 4]] or any integral multiples of $[[USD Value 4]] in excess thereof in the case of a Floating Rate Advance), any portion of the outstanding Advances upon three Business Days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent by 10:00 a.m. (local time). 

^^Minimum Amount of Each Advance. Each Advance shall be in a minimum amount of (i) EUR 1,000,000 and in multiples of EUR 100,000 if in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Subfacility, (ii) S$ 1,000,000 and in multiples of S$ 100,000 if in excess thereof in the case of the Singapore Subfacility, (iii) $[[USD Value 3]] and in multiple of $[[USD Value 4]] if in excess thereof in the case of Eurocurrency Advances under the US Facility (iv) H$ 5,000,000 and in multiples of H$ 1,000,000 if in excess thereof in the case of the Hong Kong Subfacility, (v) Japanese Yen JPY 100,000,000 and in multiples of Japanese Yen JPY 10,000,000 if in excess thereof in the case of the Japan Subfacility, and (vi) $[[USD Value 5: Number]] and in multiples of $[[USD Value 4]] if in excess thereof in the case of Floating Advances under the US Facility. 

^^Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances. Each Borrower shall select the Type of Advance, the Interest Period (if applicable) and the Agreed Currency applicable thereto from time to time. Each Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, (a “Borrowing Notice”) (i) not later than 10:00 a.m. (London time) at least three Business Days before the Borrowing Date in the case of Eurocurrency Advances requested from the Administrative Agent, (ii) not later than 12:00 noon (Singapore time) at least three Business Days before the Borrowing Date in the case of SIBOR Advances requested from the Administrative Agent (iii) not later than 12:00 noon (Hong Kong time) at least three Business Days before the Borrowing Date in the case of HIBOR Advances requested from the Administrative Agent, (iv) not later than 12:00 noon (Singapore time) at least three Business Days before the Borrowing Date in the case LIBOR Euroyen Advances requested from the Administrative Agent and (v) not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date in the case of Floating Rate Advances requested from the Administrative Agent, specifying: 

^^the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Advance; 

^^the aggregate amount of such Advance; 

^^the Type of Advance; and 

^^the Interest Period and Agreed Currency applicable thereto. 

Timing and mechanics of Overdraft Loans shall be as set forth in the Overdraft Facility Agreement. 

2.7.1 Continuation of Eurocurrency Advances. The provisions of this Section 2.7.1 shall apply to each Subfacility. Each Eurocurrency Advance shall continue as an Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time each such Advance shall automatically continue as an Advance in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless (x) such Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.2 or (y) the applicable Borrower shall have 

given the Administrative Agent a Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Advance continue as an Advance for the same or another Interest Period. 

Subject to the terms of Section 2.5, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, any applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to continue all or any part of an Eurocurrency Advance, SIBOR Advance, HIBOR Advance or LIBOR Euroyen Advance denominated in the same Agreed Currency. Any such Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto, (a “Continuation Notice”) of each continuation of an Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (London time) at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested continuation to the Administrative Agent, specifying: 

^^^the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such continuation, and 

^^^the Agreed Currency and amount into which such Advance is to be continued and the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 

2.7.3B Continuation of LIBOR Euroyen Advance. With respect to each LIBOR Euroyen Advance which is outstanding, at or before 11:00 a.m. (Singapore time) three Business Days before the end of the then applicable LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period, the Japan Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in form and substance substantially as attached as Exhibit G-2 (“Japan Rollover Notice”) either of (i) the next LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period which such Japan Borrower has selected as applicable to the LIBOR Euroyen Advance, which new LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period shall commence on and include the last day of the prior LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period, or (ii) the intention of such Japan Borrower to repay such LIBOR Euroyen Advance at the end of the relevant LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period. If such Japan Borrower fails to select and to notify the Administrative Agent of the LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period applicable to the LIBOR Euroyen Advance, or of its intention to repay such LIBOR Euroyen Advance, the Japan Borrower shall be deemed to have selected a new Interest Period of one month for such Advance. 

^^Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Eurocurrency Advance, SIBOR Advance, HIBOR Advance and LIBOR Euroyen Advance shall bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate, the SIBOR Rate, the HIBOR Rate or the LIBOR Euroyen Rate, as applicable, on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Advance based upon each Borrower’s selections under Sections 2.6 and 2.7 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Floating Rate Advance is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.7.2 to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a Eurocurrency Advance pursuant to Section 2.7.2 at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advances maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in such applicable rate. Each Eurocurrency Advance, SIBOR Advance, HIBOR Advance and LIBOR Euroyen Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Eurocurrency Interest Period, SIBOR Interest Period, HIBOR Interest Period or LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Eurocurrency Interest Period, SIBOR Interest Period, HIBOR Interest Period or LIBOR Euroyen Interest Period at the Eurocurrency Rate, SIBOR Rate, HIBOR Rate or LIBOR Euroyen Rate as applicable determined as applicable to such Eurocurrency Advance, SIBOR Advance, HIBOR Advance or LIBOR Euroyen Advance.
