^^^Payment for Capital Replacement. The Capital Replacement has been performed and/or installed on the Property in a good and workmanlike manner with suitable materials (or in the case of a partial disbursement, performed and/or installed on the Property to an acceptable stage) and paid for by Mortgagor as evidenced by copies of all applicable paid invoices or bills submitted to Lender by Mortgagor at the time Mortgagor requests disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Fund.

^^^No Default. There is no condition, event or act that would constitute a default (with or without notice and/or lapse of time) under this Agreement or the Security Instrument or a payment default under any other Loan Document.

^^^Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties of Mortgagor set forth in this Agreement and in the Loan Documents are true in all material respects.

^^^Continuing Compliance. Mortgagor is in full compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Mortgagor is a party and any request or demand by Lender permitted thereby.

^^^Approvals. All licenses, permits, and approvals of governmental authorities required for the Capital Replacement as completed to the applicable stage have been obtained.

^^^Legal Compliance. The Capital Replacement as completed to the applicable stage does not violate any laws, ordinance, rules or regulations, or building lines or restrictions applicable to the Property.

^Right to Complete Capital Replacements. If Mortgagor abandons or fails to proceed diligently to undertake and/or complete any Capital Replacement in a timely fashion or is otherwise in default under this Agreement for 30 days after written notice of such failure by Lender to Mortgagor, Lender shall have the right (but not the obligation) to enter upon the Property and take over and cause the completion of such Capital Replacement. However, no such notice or grace period shall apply in the case of such failure which could, in Lender’s reasonable judgment, absent immediate exercise by Lender of a right or remedy under this Agreement, result in harm to Lender or impairment of the security given under the Security Instrument or any other Loan Document. Any contracts entered into or indebtedness incurred upon the exercise of such right may be in the name of Mortgagor, and Lender is hereby irrevocably appointed the attorney in fact of Mortgagor, such appointment being coupled with an interest, to enter into such contracts, incur such obligations, enforce any contracts or agreements made by or on behalf of Mortgagor (including the prosecution and defense of all actions and proceedings in connection with the Capital Replacement and the payment, settlement or compromise of all bills and claims for materials and work performed in connection with the Capital Replacement) and do any and all things necessary or proper to complete any Capital Replacement including signing Mortgagor’s name to any contracts and documents as may be deemed necessary by Lender. In no event shall Lender be required to expend its own funds to complete any Capital Replacement, but Lender may, in its sole discretion, advance such funds. Any funds advanced shall be added to the outstanding balance of the Loan, secured by the Security Instrument and payable to Lender by Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of the Security Instrument pertaining to the protection of Lender’s security and advances made by Lender. Mortgagor waives any and all claims it may have against Lender for materials used, work performed or resultant damage to the Property except as arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender.

^Inspection. Upon reasonable prior written notice, Lender or any representative of Lender may periodically inspect any Capital Replacement in process and upon completion during normal business hours or at any other reasonable time upon reasonable prior written notice to Mortgagor (except in an emergency, as determined by Lender in its discretion or after an Event of Default, in which event no such prior notice shall be required). Lender shall be entitled to deduct a reasonable inspection fee from the Replacement Reserve Fund for performing any such inspection. If Lender, in its reasonable discretion, retains a professional inspection engineer or other qualified third party to inspect any Capital Replacement, Lender also shall be entitled to deduct from the Replacement Reserve Fund an amount sufficient to pay all reasonable fees and expenses charged by such third party inspector.

^Insufficient Account. If Mortgagor requests disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Fund for a Capital Replacement in accordance with this Agreement in an amount which exceeds the amount on deposit in the Replacement Reserve Fund, Lender shall disburse to Mortgagor only the amount on deposit in the Replacement Reserve Fund. Mortgagor shall pay all additional amounts required in connection with any such Capital Replacement from Mortgagor’s own funds.

^Security Agreement. To secure Mortgagor’s obligations under this Agreement and to further secure Mortgagor’s obligations under the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, and to secure the Borrower’s payment obligations under the Loan Documents, Mortgagor hereby conveys, pledges, transfers and grants to Lender a security interest pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Minnesota or any other applicable law in and to all money in the Replacement Reserve Fund, as same may increase or decrease from time to time, all interest and dividends thereon and all proceeds thereof.

^Post Default. If Mortgagor defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or under the Security Instrument or any other Loan Document to which it is a party, or if Borrower defaults in the payment of any amount due under any Loan Document, after the expiration of any applicable notice or cure period, Lender shall have all remedies available to it under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Minnesota and under any other applicable law. In addition, Lender may retain all money in the Replacement Reserve Fund, including interest, and in Lender’s discretion, may apply such amounts, without restriction and without any specific order of priority, to the payment of any and all indebtedness or obligations of Borrower or Mortgagor set forth in the Note, Security Instrument or any other Loan Document, including, but not limited to, principal, interest, taxes, insurance, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including those of Lender’s in-house counsel) and disbursements actually incurred and/or repairs to the Property.

^Termination. If not sooner terminated by written concurrence of the parties, this Agreement shall terminate upon the payment in full of the Loan and all indebtedness incurred in connection therewith and upon such termination, Lender shall pay to Mortgagor all funds remaining in the Replacement Reserve Fund.

^No Amendment. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to amend, modify, alter, change or supersede the terms and provisions of the Note, Security Instrument or any other Loan Document; and, if there is a conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and those of the Note, Security Instrument, or any other Loan Document then the terms and provisions of the Note, Security Instrument or such other Loan Document shall control.

^Release; Indemnity.

^^Release. Mortgagor covenants and agrees that, in performing any of its duties under this Agreement, none of Lender, or any of its agents or employees shall be liable for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses that may be incurred by any of them as a result of such performance, except that no such party will be released from liability for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arising out of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such party.

^Attorneys’ Fees. In the event that Lender engages the services of an attorney at law to enforce the provisions of this Agreement against Mortgagor, then Mortgagor shall pay all costs of such enforcement, including any reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including those of Lender’s in-house counsel) and disbursements actually incurred.

^Compliance with Laws; Insurance Requirements.

Mortgagor shall at all times have the sole responsibility for ensuring that all Capital Replacements are completed in accordance with all such governmental requirements.
