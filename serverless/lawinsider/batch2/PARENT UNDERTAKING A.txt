^Terms defined in either the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the Sale Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Agreement are used in this Agreement as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the Sale Agreement, as applicable.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the substantial direct and indirect benefits to the Parent Undertaking Parties from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Sale Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parent Undertaking Parties hereby agree that, effective as of the date hereof, as follows:

^**Unconditional Undertaking**.  
^^The Parent Undertaking Parties, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably undertake and agree with and for the benefit of each of the Purchasers and the other Owners, each of the Facility Agents and the Agent (collectively the “**Indemnified Parties**”) to cause the due and punctual performance and observance by the Servicer (so long as any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) and each of the Originators and each of their respective successors and assigns, of such party’s covenants, agreements and obligations contained i n (i) the Receivables Purchase Agreement; (ii) the Receivables Sale Agreement and (iii) the other Transaction Documents (together, the “**Obligations**”) and undertake and agree to pay any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them, in enforcing any rights under this Agreement. In the event that the Servicer (so long as any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators shall fail in any manner whatsoever to perform or observe any of its Obligations when the same shall be required to be performed or observed, then the Parent Undertaking Parties shall themselves duly and punctually perform or observe, or cause to be duly and punctually performed and observed, such Obligation, and it shall not be a condition to the accrual of the obligation of the Parent Undertaking Parties hereunder to perform or obse rve any Obligation (or to cause the same to be performed or observed) that any Indemnified Party shall have first made any request of or demand upon or given any notice to the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators or any of their successors or assigns, or have instituted any action or proceeding against the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators or any of their successors or assigns in respect thereof.

^^For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Undertaking Parties shall have no obligation to guaranty (and do not guaranty) any obligations of the Obligors under the Receivables or any obligation of the Seller under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.

^**Obligations Absolute**. The Parent Undertaking Parties, jointly and severally, undertake and agree that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents and each other document delivered in connection therewith, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The obligations of the Parent Undertaking Parties under this Agreement are independent of the Obligations, and a separate actio n or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Parent Undertaking Parties to enforce this Agreement, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators or whether the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators are joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Parent Undertaking Parties under this Agreement shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and, to the extent permitted by law, the Parent Undertaking Parties hereby irrevocably waive any defenses (except for any defenses arising or accruing as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Parties) any of them may now or hereafter have in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

^^any lack of validity or enforceability of the Obligations or any Pool Receivable, any Receivable Interest or any Related Security, or of any Transaction Document or any other document relating thereto;

^^any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other document relating thereto, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Transaction Document or any other document relating thereto;

^^any taking, exchange, release or nonperfection of or failure to transfer title to any asset or collateral, or any taking, release, amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations;

^^any manner of application of any asset or collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any asset or collateral for all or any of the Obligations or any other obligations of the Seller, the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators under the Transaction Documents or any other document relating thereto;

^^any change, restructuring or termination of the structure or existence of the Seller, the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators;

^^any failure of any Indemnified Party to disclose to the Parent Undertaking Parties any information relating to the financial condition, operations, properties or prospects of the Seller, or any of the Originators now or in the future known to such Indemnified Party (the Parent Undertaking Parties waiving any duty on the part of such Indemnified Party to disclose such information);

^^any impossibility or impracticality of performance, illegality, any act of any government, or any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by any Indemnified Party that might constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Seller, the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators or a guarantor of the Obligations; or

^^any other circumstance, event or happening whatsoever, whether foreseen or unforeseen and whether similar or dissimilar to anything referred to above in this Section 2.

This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time (x) any payment in connection with any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Indemnified Party, or (y) any performance or observance of any Obligation is rescinded or otherwise invalidated, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Seller, the Servicer (if any Affiliate of any of the Parent Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators or otherwise, all as though payment had not been made or as though such Obligation had not been performed or observed.

^**Waivers and Acknowledgments**.  
^^To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Parent Undertaking Parties hereby waive promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice (except to the extent that such other notice is expressly required to be given to the Parent Undertaking Parties by any Indemnified Party pursuant to any other Transaction Document) with respect to any of the Obligations and this Agreement and any other document related thereto, and any requirement that any Indemnified Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Servicer (whether or not any Affiliate of any of the Pare nt Undertaking Parties is the Servicer) or any of the Originators or any other Person or any asset or collateral.
