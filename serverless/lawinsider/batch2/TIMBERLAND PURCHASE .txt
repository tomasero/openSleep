Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, or fees due under the Excise Tax Act and/or under the statutes referred to in the Taxes, Duties and Fees (GST/HST) Regulations resulting from or arising in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. 

^ \centered 15. Commission. Purchaser and Seller each represent and warrant to the other that no broker, agent or finder, licensed or otherwise has been engaged by it, respectively, in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any such claim for broker’s, agent’s or finder’s fee or commission in connection with the negotiation, execution or consummation of this transaction, the party upon whose alleged statement, representation or agreement such claim or liability arises shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other party from and against such claim and liability, including without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.

^ \centered 16. Possession. Purchaser, subject to the Permitted Exceptions, shall be entitled to possession of the Real Property on the Closing Date. 

^ \centered 17. Default. 

^ \centered (a) If Seller defaults in its contractual performance herein in any material way, and Seller does not cure such default within ten (10) days following Seller’s receipt of notice of such default from Purchaser, Purchaser shall have all available remedies at law or equity, including but not limited to the remedy of specific performance; provided, however that in no event shall Purchaser be entitled to monetary damages in excess of One Million Canadian Dollars (C$[[USD Value 5: Number]]) (the “Damages Cap”). 

^ \centered (b) Purchaser acknowledges that if Purchaser fails to purchase the Real Property for any reason other than the breach of Seller or termination of this Agreement by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9 or non-fulfillment of a contingency pursuant to Section 13(b), Seller shall be entitled to compensation from Purchaser (as its sole remedy) for the detriment resulting from the removal of the Real Property from the market, and entering into this Agreement rather than selling to other potential purchasers. Therefore, in the event of Purchaser’s failure to purchase the Real Property for any reason other than the breach of Seller or termination of this Agreement by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9 or non-fulfillment of a contingency pursuant to Section 13(b), Seller shall have, as Seller’s exclusive option, the right to receive from Purchaser One Million Canadian Dollars (C$[[USD Value 5]]) as liquidated damages and not a penalty. The parties acknowledge and agree that the above reference amount is, as of the Effective Date, a reasonable estimate of Seller’s damages, considering all of the circumstances existing on the Effective Date and that proof of actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult.    

^ \centered 18. Third Party Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any Contracts, Leases or Personal Property, if an assignment or transfer or an attempt to make such an assignment or transfer without the consent or approval of a third party would constitute a breach or violation thereof or affect adversely the rights of Purchaser or Seller thereunder; and any transfer or assignment to Purchaser by Seller of any interest under any such Contracts, Leases or Personal Property, that requires the consent or approval of such third party shall be made subject to such consent or approval being obtained. In the event any such consent or approval is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to cooperate in all reasonable respects with Purchaser in its efforts to obtain any such consent or approval after the Closing Date until such time as such consent or approval has been obtained, and Seller will cooperate in all reasonable respects with Purchaser in any lawful and economically feasible arrangement to provide that Purchaser shall receive the interest of the Seller in the benefits under any such Contracts, Leases or Personal Property and indemnify Purchaser against any liabilities directly attributable to the failure to secure such consent or approval (except that any such arrangement shall not require performance by Seller as an agent of Purchaser); provided that Purchaser shall undertake to and shall pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent Purchaser would have been responsible therefor if such consent or approval had been obtained. Seller’s indemnification in this Section 18 shall be subject to the Limitations as to Claims detailed in Section 12(c) of this Agreement. 

^ \centered 19. Attorneys’ Fees. In the event of the bringing of any action or suit by either party against the other party by reason of any breach of any of the covenants, conditions, agreements or provisions on the part of the other party arising out of this Agreement, the party in whose favor final judgment shall be entered shall be entitled to have and recover of and from the other party all costs and expenses of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees on a solicitor and client basis. 

^ \centered 20. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced according to the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. 

^ \centered 21. Notices.

Purchaser shall have the right, without obtaining Seller’s consent, to transfer or assign its interest in this Agreement to a third party identified by Purchaser in writing prior to Closing; provided that Purchaser shall remain directly and primarily liable for Purchaser’s obligations pursuant to the Agreement and in no way shall such an assignment be deemed a waiver, release or novation.
