^^Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Lender and its successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment by the Borrowers as and when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations. All Obligations shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance on this Agreement.

^^Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor, or secured by assets of such Guarantor, under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors.

^^If any of the Obligations, or any part thereof, are not paid when due, either by its terms or as the result of exercise of any power to accelerate, each Guarantor shall, on demand therefor by the Lender, pay the amount due thereon to the Lender, and it shall not be necessary for the Lender (and each Guarantor expressly waives any rights it might otherwise have to require the Lender) to proceed against any Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person; provided, however, that no demand shall be required if such demand is impracticable or otherwise prohibited by a Requirement of Law ([[Parent]]luding upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 8(e) of the Credit Agreement).

^^The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Obligations and the obligations of each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been satisfied by payment in full in cash and the Commitment shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time the Borrowers may be free from any Obligations.

^^Each Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Lender, on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify the Lender in writing that such payment is made under this Agreement for such purpose.

^^No payment or payments made by the Borrowers, any Guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Lender from the Borrowers, any Guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any other Guarantor hereunder who shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made by any Borrower, such Guarantor or any other Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or any payment in cash received or collected from any Borrower, such Guarantor or any other Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations, up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitment is terminated.

3.**No Subrogation**. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any Guarantor hereunder, or any setoff or application of funds of any Guarantor by the Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Lender against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor or against any guarantee or right of setoff held by the Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrowers or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Lender by the Borrowers on account of the Obligations are paid in full in cash and the Commitment is terminated. Without limiting the foregoing, if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights or otherwise at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Lender, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Lender in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Lender, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Lender may determine.

4.**Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights**. Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, (a) any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Lender may be rescinded by the Lender, and any of the Obligations continued, (b) the Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Lender, (c) the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, and (d) any guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Lender for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.

5.**Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional**. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Lender upon the guarantee contained in Section 2 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in Section 2; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or [[Parent]]urred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee contain in Section 2; and all dealings between the Borrowers or any Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Lender, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in Section 2. Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrowers or any Guarantor with respect to the Obligations. The guarantee contained in Section 2 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Lender, (b) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrowers or any other Person against the Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrowers or the Guarantors) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrowers from the Obligations, or of any or all of the Guarantors under the guarantee contained in Section 2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. 

When making a demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrowers, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrowers or any such other Person or to realize upon any or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrowers or any such other Person or of any guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof “demand” shall [[Parent]]lude the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.

6.**Bankruptcy No Discharge; Duty of Inquiry.**

^^This Agreement shall not be discharged or otherwise affected, with respect to any Guarantor, by any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding commenced by or against any Borrower or any Guarantor, [[Parent]]luding (i) any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any part of the Obligations in or as a result of any such proceeding, whether or not assented to by the Lender, or (ii) any disallowance of all or any portion of the Lender’s claim for repayment of the Obligations. If acceleration of the time for payment of any Obligations is stayed or delayed as a result of any such proceeding, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by such Guarantor on demand by the Lender.

^^If a payment by any Borrower or any other Guarantor is made and is later determined not to have been indefeasibly made in whole or in part, such payment by any Borrower or Guarantor to the Lender shall not constitute a release of any other Guarantor from any liability hereunder and (i) this Agreement shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated notwithstanding any prior release, surrender or discharge by the Lender, of this Agreement and/or of the Guarantors, and (ii) this Agreement shall apply to, any and all amounts so refunded by the Lender or paid by the Lender to another Person ([[Parent]]luding any interest [[Parent]]luded in such amount), all as though such payment had not been made or such proceeds had not been received.

^^Each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the financial condition of each Borrower and each other Guarantor and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations that diligent inquiry would reveal, and agrees that the Lender shall have no duty to advise the Guarantor of information regarding such condition or any such circumstances.

7.**Payments**. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Lender, without setoff or counterclaim by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or by such other reasonable means as the Lender may specify.

8.**Authorization**. Each Guarantor authorizes the Lender, without notice to or further assent by such Guarantor and without affecting such Guarantor’s liability hereunder (regardless of whether any subrogation or similar right that such Guarantor may have or any other right or remedy of such Guarantor is extinguished or impaired), from time to time to:

^^terminate, release, compromise, subordinate, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the amount or time, manner or place of payment of, or rescind any demand for payment or acceleration of, the Obligations or any part thereof, or otherwise amend or waive the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, or any provision thereof;

^^exercise, fail to exercise, waive, suspend, terminate or suffer expiration of any of the remedies or rights of the Lender against any Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of any Obligations, as the Lender may elect in its discretion;

^^release, partially release, add or settle with any Borrower or any Guarantor, whether expressly, by operation of law or without limitation otherwise;

^^accept partial payments on the Obligations and apply any and all payments or recoveries from any Borrower or any Guarantor to such of the Obligations as the Lender may elect in its discretion;

^^refund at any time, at the discretion of the Lender, any payments or recoveries received by the Lender in question as the case may be, in respect of any Obligations; and

^^otherwise deal with any Borrower and any Guarantor as the Lender may elect in its discretion.

Each Guarantor hereby agrees that neither the Lender’s rights or remedies nor such Guarantor’s obligations under this Agreement shall be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or affected by any one or more of the following events, actions, facts or circumstances, and the liability of such Guarantor under this Agreement shall, be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of:

^^all rights and benefits under applicable law purporting to reduce a Guarantor’s obligations in proportion to the obligation of the pr[[Parent]]ipal or providing that the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the pr[[Parent]]ipal;

^^except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any requirement of marshaling or any other pr[[Parent]]iple of election of remedies and all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Lender, even though that election of remedies has destroyed a Guarantor’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Borrower or any other Guarantor;

^^any right to assert against the Lender any defense (legal or equitable), set off, counterclaim and other right that such Guarantor may now or any time hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor;
