The Company believes that the Plan will encourage the participants to contribute materially to the growth of the Company, thereby benefiting the Company’s stockholders, and will align the economic interests of the participants with those of the stockholders. The Plan was originally effective on [[Date 2: Date]] upon approval by the stockholders of the Company, and previously amended and restated on [[Date 3: Date]] upon approval by the stockholders of the Company and on [[Date 4: Date]]. This amendment and restatement will be effective [[Date 1]], subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company.

In addition, the Committee shall have discretion to make the foregoing equitable adjustments in any circumstances in which an adjustment is not mandated by this subsection (d) or applicable law, including in the event of a Change in Control.

^*Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock-Based Awards*

^^*SARs.* The Committee may grant SARs to an Employee or Non-Employee Director separately or in tandem with an Option. The following provisions are applicable to SARs:

^^^*Base Amount.* The Committee shall establish the base amount of the SAR at the time the SAR is granted.

^^^*Tandem SARs.* The Committee may grant tandem SARs either at the time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter while the Option remains outstanding; provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, SARs may be granted only at the date of the grant of the Incentive Stock Option. In the case of tandem SARs, the number of SARs granted to a Participant that shall be exercisable during a specified period shall not exceed the number of shares of Company Stock that the Participant may purchase upon the exercise of the related Option during such period. Upon the exercise of an Option, the SARs relating to the Company Stock covered by such Option shall terminate. Upon the exercise of SARs, the related Option shall terminate to the extent of an equal number of shares of Company Stock.

^^^*Exercisability.* An SAR shall be exercisable during the period specified by the Committee in the Grant Agreement and shall be subject to such vesting and other restrictions as may be specified in the Grant Agreement. The Committee may grant SARs the exercise of which is subject to achievement of performance goals or other conditions. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any or all outstanding SARs at any time for any reason. The Committee shall determine in the Grant Agreement under what circumstances and during what periods a Participant may exercise an SAR after termination of employment or service. A tandem SAR shall be exercisable only while the Option to which it is related is exercisable.

^^^*Grants to Non-Exempt Employees.* SARs granted to persons who are non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, may not be exercisable for at least six months after the date of grant (except that such SARs may become exercisable, as determined by the Committee, upon the Participant’s death, Disability or retirement, or upon a Change in Control or other circumstances permitted by applicable regulations).

^^^*Value of SARs.* When a Participant exercises SARs, the Participant shall receive in settlement of such SARs an amount equal to the value of the stock appreciation for the number of SARs exercised. The stock appreciation for an SAR is the amount by which the Fair Market Value of the underlying Company Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR exceeds the base amount of the SAR as described in subsection (i).

^^^*Form of Payment.* The Committee shall determine whether the stock appreciation for an SAR shall be paid in the form of shares of Company Stock, cash or a combination of the two. For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Company Stock to be received, shares of Company Stock shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR. If shares of Company Stock are to be received upon exercise of an SAR, cash shall be delivered in lieu of any fractional share.

^^*Other Stock-Based Awards.* The Committee may grant other awards not specified in Sections 7, 8 or 9 or subsection (a) above that are based on or measured by Company Stock to Employees and Non-Employee Directors, on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate.

The Committee may provide that Dividend Equivalents shall be payable based on the achievement of specific performance goals.

^^*Payment with Respect to Dividend Equivalents.* Dividend Equivalents may be payable in cash or shares of Company Stock or in a combination of the two, as determined by the Committee.

^*Qualified Performance-Based Compensation*

^^*Designation as Qualified Performance-Based Compensation.* The Committee may determine that Stock Units, Stock Awards, Dividend Equivalents or Other Stock-Based Awards granted to an Employee shall be considered “qualified performance-based compensation” under section 162(m) of the Code, in which case the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply. The Committee may also grant Options or SARs under which the exercisability of the Options is subject to achievement of performance goals as described in this Section 12 or otherwise.

^^*Performance Goals.* When Grants are made under this Section 12, the Committee shall establish in writing (i) the objective performance goals that must be met, (ii) the period during which performance will be measured, (iii) the maximum amounts that may be paid if the performance goals are met, and (iv) any other conditions that the Committee deems appropriate and consistent with the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code for “qualified performance-based compensation.” The performance goals shall satisfy the requirements for “qualified performance-based compensation,” including the requirement that the achievement of the goals be substantially uncertain at the time they are established and that the performance goals be established in such a way that a third party with knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether and to what extent the performance goals have been met. The Committee shall not have discretion to increase the amount of compensation that is payable, but may reduce the amount of compensation that is payable, pursuant to Grants identified by the Committee as “qualified performance-based compensation.”

The performance goals may relate to one or more business units or the performance of the Company as a whole, or any combination of the foregoing. Performance goals need not be uniform as among Participants.

^^*Timing of Establishment of Goals.* The Committee shall establish the performance goals in writing either before the beginning of the performance period or during a period ending no later than the earlier of (i) 90 days after the beginning of the performance period or (ii) the date on which [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the performance period has been completed, or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under section 162(m) of the Code.

^^*Certification of Results.* The Committee shall certify the performance results for the performance period specified in the Grant Agreement after the performance period ends. The Committee shall determine the amount, if any, to be paid pursuant to each Grant based on the achievement of the performance goals and the satisfaction of all other terms of the Grant Agreement.

^^*Death, Disability or Other Circumstances.* The Committee may provide in the Grant Agreement that Grants under this Section 12 shall be payable, in whole or in part, in the event of the Participant’s death or disability, a Change in Control or under other circumstances consistent with the Treasury regulations and rulings under section 162(m) of the Code.

^*Deferrals*

The Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash (including dividend equivalents) or the delivery of shares that would otherwise be due to the Participant in connection with any Grant. The Committee shall establish rules and procedures for any such deferrals, consistent with applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code.

^*Withholding of Taxes*

^^*Required Withholding.* All Grants under the Plan shall be subject to applicable federal (including FICA), state and local tax withholding requirements. The Company may require that the Participant or other person receiving or exercising Grants pay to the Company the amount of any federal, state or local taxes that the Company is required to withhold with respect to such Grants, or the Company may deduct from other wages paid by the Company the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such Grants.

^^*Election to Withhold Shares.* If the Committee so permits, a Participant may elect to satisfy the Company’s tax withholding obligation with respect to Grants paid in Company Stock by having shares withheld, at the time such Grants become taxable, up to an amount that does not exceed the minimum applicable withholding tax rate for federal (including FICA), state and local tax liabilities. The election must be in a form and manner prescribed by the Committee.

^*Transferability of Grants*

^^*Restrictions on Transfer.* Except as described in subsection (b) below, only the Participant may exercise rights under a Grant during the Participant’s lifetime, and a Participant may not transfer those rights except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. When a Participant dies, the personal representative or other person entitled to succeed to the rights of the Participant may exercise such rights.

^*Consequences of a Change in Control*

^^In the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may take any one or more of the following actions with respect to some or all outstanding Grants, without the consent of any Participant: (i) the Committee may determine that outstanding Options and SARs shall be fully exercisable, and restrictions on outstanding Stock Awards and Stock Units shall lapse, as of the date of the Change in Control or at such other time as the Committee determines, (ii) the Committee may require that Participants surrender their outstanding Options and SARs in exchange for one or more payments by the Company, in cash or Company Stock as determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock subject to the Participant’s unexercised Options and SARs exceeds the Exercise Price, or Base Amount, as applicable, if any, and on such terms as the Committee determines, (iii) after giving Participants an opportunity to exercise their outstanding Options and SARs, the Committee may terminate any or all unexercised Options and SARs at such time as the Committee deems appropriate, (iv) with respect to Participants holding Stock Units, Other Stock-Based Awards or Dividend Equivalents, the Committee may determine that such Participants shall receive one or more payments in settlement of such Stock Units, Other Stock-Based Awards or Dividend Equivalents, in such amount and form and on such terms as may be determined by the Committee, (v) if the Company is the surviving corporation, the Committee may determine that Grants will remain outstanding after the Change in Control, or (vi) if the Company is not the surviving corporation, the Committee may determine that Grants that remain outstanding after the Change in Control shall be converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). Such acceleration, surrender, termination, settlement or conversion shall take place as of the date of the Change in Control or such other date as the Committee may specify.

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Board may amend the Plan in such manner as it deems appropriate in the event of a change in applicable law or regulations.

^^*Grants in Connection with Corporate Transactions and Otherwise.* Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to (i) limit the right of the Committee to make Grants under this Plan in connection with the acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business or assets of any corporation, firm or association, including Grants to employees thereof who become Employees, or for other proper corporate purposes, or (ii) limit the right of the Company to grant stock options or make other stock-based awards outside of this Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may make a Grant to an employee of another corporation who becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or property, reorganization or liquidation involving the Company in substitution for a grant made by such corporation. The terms and conditions of the Grants may vary from the terms and conditions required by the Plan and from those of the substituted stock incentives, as determined by the Committee.

^^*Compliance with Law.* The Plan, the exercise of Options and the obligations of the Company to issue or transfer shares of Company Stock under Grants shall be subject to all applicable laws and to approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. With respect to persons subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan and all transactions under the Plan comply with all applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. In addition, it is the intent of the Company that Incentive Stock Options comply with the applicable provisions of section 422 of the Code, that Grants of “qualified performance-based compensation” comply with the applicable provisions of section 162(m) of the Code and that, to the extent applicable, Grants are either exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any legal requirement of section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422, 162(m) or 409A of the Code as set forth in the Plan ceases to be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422, 162(m) or 409A of the Code, that Plan provision shall cease to apply. The Committee may revoke any Grant if it is contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it into compliance with any valid and mandatory government regulation.

No Participant or any other person shall under any circumstances acquire any property interest in any specific assets of the Company. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payment from the Company hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

^^*Rights of Participants.* Nothing in this Plan shall entitle any Employee, Non-Employee Director or other person to any claim or right to receive a Grant under this Plan.
