\centered **RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT**

Pursuant to the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice (the ***“Grant Notice”***) and this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the ***“Agreement”***) (collectively, the ***“Award”***) and in consideration of your services rendered or to be rendered, as applicable, [[Organization 1 Name]] (the ***“Company”***) has granted you a Restricted Stock Unit Award under its 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the ***“Plan”***). Defined terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement but defined in the Grant Notice or the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Grant Notice or the Plan, as applicable.

The details of your Award, in addition to those set forth in the Grant Notice and the Plan, are as follows:

1.**GRANT OF THE AWARD.**This Award represents the right to be issued on a future date the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock as indicated in the Grant Notice. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “***Account***”) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Award. This Award was granted in consideration of your services to the Company. Except as otherwise provided herein, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company (other than past and future services to the Company) with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the shares or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.

2.**VESTING**.

(a)Subject to the limitations contained herein, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting criteria provided in the Grant Notice, provided that no shares will vest following a termination of your Continuous Service. Upon such termination of your Continuous Service, the Award shall terminate and the shares credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination will be forfeited at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such underlying shares of Common Stock or the Award.

(b)The Company will prepare financial statements for the 2011 calendar year which will be audited by the Company’s independent auditors during the first quarter of 2012. If the information derived from the final 2011 financial statements as audited by the Company’s independent auditors does not reflect that the 2011 Performance Goal has been attained, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, the Award shall terminate and the shares credited to the Account that were not vested on such date will be forfeited at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such underlying shares of Common Stock or the Award. For purposes of determining whether the 2011 Performance Goal has been attained, “non-GAAP operating income” shall be defined as operating loss for the year ended [[Date 1: Date]], as reported in the Company’s audited financials statements 

included in the Company’s 2011 Annual Report of Form 10-K, presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), adjusted for noncash items consisting of equity compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred revenue and also adjusted for restructuring and other charges (reported in accordance with ASC 420-10-S99) and any charges that qualify for treatment as “Unusual Items” (in accordance with ASC 225-20-45-16) and are reported as a separate component of income from continuing items. The ending result of these adjustments to GAAP operating loss must reflect an income position in order to meet the definition of non-GAAP operating income.

3.**NUMBER OF SHARES**.

(a)The number of shares of Common Stock subject to your Award as referenced in your Grant Notice may be adjusted from time to time for capitalization adjustments, as set forth in Section 11 of the Plan.

(b)Any shares, cash or other property that becomes subject to the Award pursuant to this Section 3, if any, shall be subject, in a manner determined by the Board, to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.

(c)Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3, no fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock shall be created pursuant to this Section 3. The Board shall, in its discretion, determine an equivalent benefit for any fractional shares or fractional shares that might be created by the adjustments referred to in this Section 3.

4.**SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you may not be issued any shares of Common Stock under your Award unless the shares of Common Stock are either then registered under the Securities Act or, if such shares of Common Stock are not then so registered, the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award must also comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.

5.**LIMITATIONS ON TRANSFER.** Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions herein and applicable securities laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, you may designate a third party 

who, in the event of your death, shall thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.

6.**DATE OF ISSUANCE.**

(a)The Company will deliver to you a number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to the number of vested shares subject to your Award, including any additional shares received pursuant to Section 3 above that relate to those vested shares, but less any number of shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 12, on the applicable vesting date(s). However, if a scheduled delivery date falls on a date that is not a business day, such delivery date shall instead fall on the next following business day.

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) you are subject to the Company’s policy permitting officers and directors to sell shares only during certain “window” periods, in effect from time to time or you are otherwise prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s Common Stock in the public market and any shares covered by your Award are scheduled to be delivered on a day (the “***Original Distribution Date***”) that does not occur during an open “window period” applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with such policy, or does not occur on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of the Company’s common stock on the open market, and (ii) you have not electedt to satisfy the Company’s tax withholding obligations by withholding shares from your distribution, then such shares shall not be delivered on such Original Distribution Date and shall instead be delivered on the first business day of the next occurring open “window period” applicable to you pursuant to such policy (regardless of whether you are still providing continuous services at such time) or the next business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s Common Stock in the open market, but in no event later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third calendar month of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Original Distribution Date occurs. The form of such delivery (*e.g.*, a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company.

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following provisions shall apply if you elect to defer delivery of the shares subject to your Award beyond the vesting date in accordance with this Section:

(i)If you elect to defer delivery of such shares of Common Stock beyond the vesting date under the Company’s 2001 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “***Deferred Compensation Plan***”), then the Company will not deliver such shares on the vesting date or dates provided in your Grant Notice and subject to the foregoing provisions, but will instead deliver such shares to you on the date or dates that you so elect, subject to the terms and conditions of the Deferred Compensation Plan (the “***Settlement Date***”). If you elect to defer delivery of the shares subject to your Award under the Deferred Compensation Plan, the shares subject to your Award are subject to all the applicable terms and conditions of the Deferred Compensation Plan, 

which shall control in the event of any discrepancy between the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Grant Notice, this Agreement or the Plan.

(ii)If the Company determines that you are subject to its policy regarding insider trading of the Company’s stock or you are otherwise prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s stock in the public market and any shares of Common Stock subject to your Award are scheduled to be delivered on a Settlement Date that does not occur during an open “window period” applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with such policy, or a day when you are prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s stock in the public market and you have not elected to satisfy the Company’s tax withholding obligations by withholding shares from your distribution, then such shares shall not be delivered on such Settlement Date and shall instead be delivered as soon as practicable on the first business day within the next open “window period” applicable to you pursuant to such policy or the next day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s stock in the public market (regardless of whether you are still providing continuous services at such time); *provided, however,* that unless the delay until the next open window period or the next day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of the Company’s stock in the public market would not result in the imposition of any additional taxes under the Code (including section 409A of the Code), the delivery of the shares shall not be delayed pursuant to this provision beyond sixty (60) days following the selected Settlement Date. The form of such delivery (*e.g.*, a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company.

(iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Plan, in the event of a corporate transaction described in Section 11(c) of the Plan that is not a 409A Change of Control, then subject to the Company’s discretion related to termination of the Deferred Compensation Plan and outstanding deferrals pursuant to Article 10 thereof, the surviving or acquiring corporation (or its parent company) (the “Acquiring Entity”) must either assume, continue or substitute your Award, and shares subject to your Award that vest, if any, shall be issued to you by the Acquiring Entity in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and your deferral election. For such purposes, a “409A Change in Control” is a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company’s assets, as provided in Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) and applicable guidance thereunder.

(iv)In the event that you have a Separation From Service that is not a termination of your Continuous Service, then any unvested shares subject to your Award that vest following your Separation From Service will be issued to you in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(a) and 6(b). “Separation From Service” has the meaning set forth in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.

7.**EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS.** You hereby acknowledge and agree that the manner selected by the Company by which you indicate your consent to your Grant Notice is also deemed to be your execution of your Grant Notice and of this Agreement. You further agree that such manner of indicating consent may be relied upon as your

8.**IRREVOCABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY.** You constitute and appoint the Secretary of the Company as attorney-in-fact and agent to transfer said Common Stock on the books of the Company with full power of substitution in the premises, and to execute with respect to such securities and other property all documents of assignment and/or transfer and all stock certificates necessary or appropriate to make all securities negotiable and complete any transaction herein contemplated. This is a special power of attorney coupled with an interest (specifically, the Company’s underlying security interest in retaining the shares of Common Stock in the event you do not perform the associated services for the Company), and is irrevocable and shall survive your death or legal incapacity. This power of attorney is limited to the matters specified in this Agreement ..

9.**DIVIDENDS.** You shall receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a capitalization adjustment as provided in the Plan; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply with respect to any shares of Common Stock that are delivered to you in connection with your Award after such shares have been delivered to you.

10.**RESTRICTIVE LEGENDS.** The certificates representing the Common Stock shall have endorsed thereon appropriate legends as determined by the Company.

shall have no obligation to issue a certificate for such shares and any such shares shall be automatically reacquired by the Company for no consideration.

13.**UNSECURED OBLIGATION.** Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of a vested Award, you shall be considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement.
