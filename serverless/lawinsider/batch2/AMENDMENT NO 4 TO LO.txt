FOR VALUE RECEIVED, **[[Borrower]]**, a Wisconsin corporation (the “Borrower”), hereby promises to pay to the order of **[[I]]** (“M&I”), on the Revolving Credit Termination Date (as defined in the Loan Agreement referred to below) (or such earlier maturity date resulting from acceleration) the principal sum of SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ($[[USD Value 5]]) or such lesser amount of revolving credit loans which are owing from the Borrower to M&I under the Revolving Credit Commitment provided for in the Loan Agreement referenced below. The Borrower hereby agrees to make all required payments of principal necessary so that the outstanding amount of revolving credit loans plus the undrawn face amount of letters of credit, all as described in the Loan Agreement, shall not at any time, exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment, as defined in the Loan Agreement.

The unpaid principal shall bear interest from the date hereof until paid at an annual rate, computed on the basis of a 360-day year, as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Interest accrued on the outstanding principal balance shall be payable on the last day of each month, commencing on [[Date 13: Date]], and continuing thereafter until the outstanding principal balance is repaid in full, with all accrued interest paid with the final payment of principal. Interest will be payable in the amounts in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay such interest.

In the event that any amount of the principal of, or interest on, this Note is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), the entire principal amount outstanding under this Note shall bear interest at the annual rate equal to the rate otherwise in effect under the Loan Agreement plus three percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) from the due date until all such overdue amounts have been paid in full.

Payments of both principal and interest and other amounts due hereunder are to be made in lawful money of the United States of America at the offices of [[Organization 4 Name]], Attention: Commercial Loan Department, 770 North Water Street, Wisconsin 53202, or at such other place as the holder shall designate in writing to the maker.

The makers and all endorsers hereby severally waive presentment for payment, protest and demand, notice of protest, demand and of dishonor and nonpayment of this Note. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by M&I or any subsequent holder, including the reasonable fees of counsel, in connection with the protection and enforcement of the rights of M&I or any subsequent holder of this Note, including without limitation, the collection of any amounts due under this Note and the protection and enforcement

QBMKE\6050039.2    

of such rights in any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceedings involving the Borrower, both before and after judgment.

This Note constitutes the Revolving Credit Note described in that certain Loan Agreement, as amended (the Loan Agreement, as previously amended and as further amended from time to time, is referred to herein as the “Loan Agreement”) dated as of [[Date 2]] by and between M&I and the Borrower to which Loan Agreement reference is hereby made for a statement of the terms and conditions under which the Revolving Credit Loans evidenced hereby may be made and a description of the terms and conditions upon which this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part. In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Loan Agreement, shall occur, the entire unpaid principal and accrued interest may be automatically due and payable or may be declared due and payable as provided in the Loan Agreement.

This Note is an amendment and restatement of that certain Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note executed by the Borrower payable to the order of M&I in the original principal amount of $[[USD Value 4]] dated as of [[Date 3]], as amended and restated on [[Date 8]] (the “Prior Note”) and evidences an extension and continuation of the indebtedness evidenced by the Prior Note. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that such indebtedness has not been repaid or extinguished and that the execution hereof does not constitute a novation of the Prior Note. Moreover, this Note shall be entitled to all security and collateral to which the Prior Note was entitled, without change or diminution in the priority of any lien or security interest granted to secure the Prior Note. The maximum principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans which may be advanced under the Loan Agreement was increased to $[[USD Value 6: Number]]
