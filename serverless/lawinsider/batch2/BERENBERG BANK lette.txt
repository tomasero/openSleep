Dear Sirs,  
We refer to the loan agreement dated 19 [[Date 2]] made between yourselves as Borrower and ourselves as Lender in which we provide you a facility of up to USD 13,000,000.00 for the part-financing of MV “Ottawa Princess” (the “Loan Agreement”). Words and expressions defined in the Loan Agreement shall have the same meaning when used in this letter.

We hereby give our consent to suspend the asset protection clause according to paragraph 10.2 (b) of the Loan Agreement through 31 [[Date 3: Date]] under the following conditions:

Please confirm this in writing to us.

We herewith agree that, starting from 1 [[Date 4: Date]] on, the paragraph 10.2(b) of the Loan Agreement should be amended as follows:

unquote  
For this request we will increase the margin to 5,00 per cent. p.a. and will debit your current account no. 0523281004 with an arrangement fee of 0.25 per cent. flat on the outstanding loan amount.
