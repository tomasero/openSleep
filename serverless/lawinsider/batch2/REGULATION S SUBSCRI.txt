The undersigned hereby acknowledges, represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company and its affiliates as follows:

^^The undersigned is acquiring the Shares for his own account as principal, not as a nominee or agent, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to, or for, resale, distribution or fractionalization thereof in whole or in part and no other person has a direct or indirect beneficial interest in such Shares or any portion thereof. Further, the undersigned does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such person or to any third person, with respect to the Shares for which the undersigned is subscribing or any part of the Shares.

^^The undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, the execution and delivery of this Agreement has been duly authorized, if applicable, and this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the undersigned.

^^The undersigned is not subscribing for the Shares as a result of or subsequent to any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio, or presented at any seminar or meeting, or any solicitation of a subscription by person previously not known to the undersigned in connection with investment Shares generally.

^^The undersigned understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Shares under the Securities Act, or to assist the undersigned in complying with the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States or of any foreign jurisdiction.

^^The undersigned is (i) experienced in making investments of the kind described in this Agreement and the related documents, (ii) able, by reason of the business and financial experience of its officers (if an entity) and professional advisors (who are not affiliated with or compensated in any way by the Company or any of its affiliates or selling agents), to protect its own interests in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement, and the related documents, and (iii) able to afford the entire loss of its investment in the Shares. The undersigned further understands that the Company currently has no business or operations and although it is contemplating entering the field of clean energy technologies, the Company currently has no agreements or arrangements with any persons in connection therewith.

^^The undersigned acknowledges his understanding that the offering and sale of the Shares is intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act. In furtherance thereof, in addition to the other representations and warranties of the undersigned made herein, the undersigned further represents and warrants to and agrees with the Company and its affiliates as follows:

\centered ii

^^^The undersigned realizes that the basis for the exemption may not be present if, notwithstanding such representations, the undersigned has in mind merely acquiring the Shares for a fixed or determinable period in the future, or for a market rise, or for sale if the market does not rise.

^^^The undersigned has the financial ability to bear the economic risk of his investment, has adequate means for providing for his current needs and personal contingencies and has no need for liquidity with respect to his investment in the Company;

^^No representations or warranties have been made to the undersigned by the Company, or any officer, employee, agent, affiliate or subsidiary of the Company, other than the representations of the Company contained herein, and in subscribing for Shares the undersigned is not relying upon any representations other than those contained herein.

^^Any resale of the Shares during the ‘distribution compliance period’ as defined in Rule 902(f) to Regulation S shall only be made in compliance with exemptions from registration afforded by Regulation S. Further, any such sale of the Shares in any jurisdiction outside of the United States will be made in compliance with the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

The undersigned has reviewed all reports and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC Documents”).

^^Other than as set forth herein, the undersigned is not relying upon any other information, representation or warranty by the Company or any officer, director, stockholder, agent or representative of the Company in determining to invest in the Shares. The undersigned has consulted, to the extent deemed appropriate by the undersigned, with the undersigned’s own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in the Shares and on that basis believes that his or its investment in the Shares is suitable and appropriate for the undersigned.

\centered vi

^^The undersigned is aware that no federal or state agency has (i) made any finding or determination as to the fairness of this investment, (ii) made any recommendation or endorsement of the Shares or the Company, or (iii) guaranteed or insured any investment in the Shares or any investment made by the Company.
