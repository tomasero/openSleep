**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^**Transfers Related to Regulatory Matters.** Lilly will license, assign, cause to be assigned, or diligently assist with efforts to assign, or provide rights to Magen to, any existing licenses, registrations, rights, or permits in its possession at the Effective Date that will be required to effect the development or Regulatory Approval of the Licensed Compounds and/or Licensed Products by Magen. Such license, assignment or provision of rights will include any and all worldwide regulatory filings and associated permits relating to Licensed Compound. 

^^**Transition Support.** The Parties agree to work in good faith to complete the provision of Lilly Know-How to Magen as soon as practicable but no later than [*] days after the Effective Date. Thereafter, during the term Lilly will grant Magen access, during normal business hours, to appropriate Lilly personnel (including [*] and [*]) for reasonable consultation related to the Lilly Know-How not to exceed [*] ([*]) hours (in two hour increments) in total. If Magen requests consultation (by telephone or videoconference) beyond this amount, Lilly will consider Magen’s request in light of the availability of Drs.

[*] is responsible for, and will pay for, any travel and associated expenses of such Lilly personnel if needed for travel to provide such consultation. Nothing contained in this Section 2.4 or otherwise in this Agreement will be construed as a guarantee by Lilly that Magen will obtain Regulatory Approval for Licensed Product. 

^^**Additional Compound Option.** If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, Lilly determines that a specific Additional Compound is available for licensing, then Lilly shall give Magen prompt written notice of the availability of such Additional Compound for licensing by Magen in the Field under the terms of this Agreement. Lilly hereby grants to Magen the exclusive option (the “Additional Compound Option”) to expand the definition of Licensed Compounds to include, on a compound-by-compound basis, any Additional Compound that Lilly has determined is available for licensing. Upon receiving written notice from Lilly that a particular Additional Compound is available for licensing, Magen shall have [*] ([*]) days to determine whether it wants to exercise its Additional Compound Option with respect to such Additional Compound. If Magen exercises such option, by providing written notice to Lilly within such time period, then such specified Additional Compound shall automatically be a Licensed Compound, and the Parties shall add such compound to the list of Licensed Compounds in Schedule A (and remove the compound from the list of Additional Compounds in Schedule B). Each such Additional Compound for which the Additional Compound Option is exercised by Magen shall be immediately a Licensed Compound upon such exercise and subject to all the rights and obligations of this Agreement with respect to Licensed Compounds, including Lilly’s right to receive milestone payments and royalty payments based on the development and commercialization of Licensed Product containing such Licensed Compound under the terms of Article 4. 

^^**Magen Right of First Refusal Option**. 

^^The Parties acknowledge that Lilly intends to continue research, development, and potential commercialization of molecules with vitamin D receptor modulation mechanisms of action for therapeutic indications outside of the Field. From time to time, Lilly may discover and advance additional molecules that are active against the vitamin D receptor and may have potential to become products within the Field (the “Follow-On Compounds”), but which are not Licensed Compounds (or Additional Compounds) under this Agreement. With respect to any such Follow-On Compound, if Lilly determines that it will seek to grant a license to such Follow-On Compound in the Field (including in response to any Third Party licensing offer or proposal to Lilly with respect to such Follow-On Compound), then Lilly shall, before offering such Follow-On Compound to any Third Party, disclose such Follow-On Compound to Magen and offer to Magen in writing the option to license such Follow-On Compound for use in the Field (a “Follow-On Option”). Any such license shall be on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between [[Organization 3 Name]] reasonably and in good faith, or (if applicable) on terms equivalent to those in a recent *bona fide* licensing offer to Lilly from a Third Party with respect to licensing such Follow-On Compound in the Field. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^If Lilly offers a Follow-On Option to Magen, then Lilly shall provide to Magen as soon as practicable such Information relating to the particular Follow-On Compound covered by the Follow-On Option as is reasonably needed for Magen to evaluate the Follow-On Compound and whether to exercise the Follow-On Option. Magen shall have a period of [*] ([*]) days to review such Lilly Information regarding the Follow-On Compound, and to exercise such Follow-On Option. If Magen exercises the Follow-On Option, then the Parties shall immediately enter into licensing negotiations regarding such Follow-On Compound and shall seek diligently and in good faith to agree on the commercially reasonable terms of and to execute a separate licensing agreement covering the license to Magen of such Follow-On Compound in the Field, by the date that is [*] ([*]) days after such exercise. Lilly may not license any Follow-On Compound to a Third Party in the Field without first providing to Magen the Follow-On Option covering such Follow-On Compound and complying with the above procedures. With respect to any such Follow-On Option provided by Lilly, if: (i) Lilly receives written notice from Magen that it does not want to license the applicable Follow-On Compound, or (ii) Magen does not exercise such Follow-On Option within the above [*] day exercise period, or (iii) the Parties fail to successfully negotiate and execute a licensing agreement for the Follow-On Compound, in the case Magen has exercised such Follow-On Option, then Lilly shall be free to license the applicable Follow-On Compound to a Third Party, *provided that* such terms are no less favorable to Lilly than those refused by Magen. 

^^**Covenant Not to Sue**. During the term of this Agreement, Lilly covenants that it will make no claim nor commence or prosecute against Magen any suit, action or proceeding of any kind based upon assertion of infringement of any claim of any issued patent owned or licensed by Lilly to the extent that such claim covers a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product. 

\centered COMMERCIAL MATTERS

Magen may change such representative from time to time by written notice to Lilly containing the name and contact information for the new representative. Likewise, Lilly will promptly (and no later than [*] ([*]) days) after the Effective Date, designate in writing the Lilly representative that shall have the responsibility of communicating with Magen under this Agreement (including the provision of that individual’s name, job title, fax and phone number) and providing all reasonable assistance with respect to the transfer and understanding of the Lilly Know-How and Lilly Patents and other matters relating to Licensed Compounds in the Field. Lilly may change such representative from time to time by written notice to Magen containing the name and contact information for the new representative. Such representatives shall make themselves reasonably available for regular conferences and meetings (by teleconference or as otherwise agreed) reasonable in frequency and duration to discuss transition and reporting matters under this Agreement, and the Lilly representative will use reasonable efforts (including seeking and obtaining all applicable Information from appropriate sources in Lilly) to answer accurately any reasonable questions posed by the Magen representative relating to Licensed Compound, Licensed Product and/or the Lilly Know-How or Lilly Patents. 

^^**Development Reporting.** Magen shall provide semi-annual written reports to the Lilly representative describing progress against the goals outlined in the Development Plan (to be solely prepared by Magen), and a description of any modifications in development strategy and goals as appropriate. 

^^**Exclusive Use of Licensed Compounds by Magen.** During the Term, Lilly covenants that it and its Affilates shall not: (i) license, transfer, or otherwise grant any rights to a Third Party with respect to any of the Licensed Compounds, or permit the use of any Licensed Compounds by any Third Party, regardless of field; or (ii) research, develop, commercialize, or sell the Licensed Compounds for its own account or for the benefit of any Affiliate, regardless of field. 

^^**Exclusivity Regarding Dermatology Applications for VDRMs.** For a period of [*] (*]) years from the Effective Date (the “Magen Exclusivity Period”), so long as Magen is using Diligent Efforts to develop, or has developed, at least one Licensed Compound into a Licensed Product, the Magen programs to develop and launch Licensed Products shall represent Lilly’s and its Affiliates’ only interest and activity with respect to development and commercialization of products based on a vitamin D receptor modulation mechanism in the Field. During the Magen Exclusivity Period, Lilly covenants that it and its Affiliates shall not pursue development, commercialization, or sale of any products containing vitamin D receptor modulator compounds for use in the Field. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^**Regulatory Matters.** Magen and/or its Affiliates or sublicensees shall have sole and exclusive rights and responsibility for seeking all necessary Regulatory Approvals to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products. Magen (or its Affiliate or sublicensee as applicable) shall hold legal title to all Marketing Applications and all Regulatory Approvals throughout the world, and shall assume full responsibility for the clinical protocols developed in support of such Marketing Applications. Except in accordance with this Agreement, Lilly shall have no financial obligation relating to Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products. Magen shall use Diligent Efforts to commence development on Licensed Compound and/or Licensed Product in accordance with the Development Plan. Magen will be responsible for all regulatory requirements during development and commercialization of Licensed Compounds and Licensed Products. Nothing contained in this Section 3.6 or otherwise in this Agreement will be construed as a guarantee by Magen that development of Licensed Product will be successful, that Regulatory Approval will be obtained for Licensed Product, or that the Licensed Product will be successfully commercialized. 

^^**Adverse Event Reporting.** Magen will report adverse events that occur during the development and marketing of Licensed Products to the relevant regulatory authorities promptly according to the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations. A copy of all adverse event reports shall be provided to Lilly at the same time as or promptly after the report is submitted to the regulatory authority. 

^^**Governmental Filings.** Lilly and Magen each agree to prepare and file whatever filings, requests or applications are required to be filed with any governmental authority in connection with the transfer of rights to Magen under this Agreement and to cooperate with one another as reasonably necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 

^^**Compliance with Law.** Magen will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to its development, manufacture, distributing, marketing, promotion, selling, importing and exporting of Licensed Products. Magen agrees and acknowledges that as holder of the regulatory documents with respect to Licensed Products, it will have sole responsibility for, among other things, adverse event reporting and all other regulatory reporting and regulatory document maintenance obligations. 

^^**Supply of Compound.** Except as set forth in Section 2.3, Lilly shall have no obligation to supply quantities of any Licensed Compound. 

^^**Cooperation.** If either Party becomes engaged in or participates in any investigation, claim, litigation or other proceeding with any Third Person, including the FDA, relating in any way to Licensed Compound or Licensed Product, the other Party will cooperate in all reasonable respects with such Party in connection therewith, including, without limitation, using its reasonable efforts to make available to the other such employees who may be reasonably necessary with respect to such investigation, claim, litigation or other proceeding, provided that, for purposes of this provision, reasonable efforts to make available any employee will be deemed to mean providing a Party with reasonable access to any such employee at a reasonable cost to be agreed in advance. 

\centered PAYMENTS 

^^**Initial License Fee****.** Within fifteen (15) days of the execution of this Agreement, Magen will pay to Lilly the non-refundable sum of One Million Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]). 

^^**Milestone Payments.** Within [*] ([*]) days of Magen or its Permitted Sellers achieving a milestone event listed below with respect to a particular Licensed Product, Magen (or the applicable Permitted Seller) will notify Lilly in writing thereof and pay to Lilly the below-specified non-creditable and non-refundable milestone payment applicable to such event. 

**Milestone Event**      **Milestone Payment**

[*]      [*] Dollars ($[*])

[*]      [*] Dollars ($[*])

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

Each Milestone Payment shall be made only once at the first achievement of each applicable milestone event with respect to each different Licensed Product. Further, if a particular Licensed Product has achieved Regulatory Approval (for a particular indication or set of indications), and such Licensed Product is subsequently developed and achieves Regulatory Approval for one or more additional indications and is sold under a separate trade name for such additional indications, then for all milestone events achieved by such Licensed Product in such subsequent development efforts for such additional indication, all applicable milestone payments shall be payable. Such milestone payments shall be made within [*] ([*]) days of First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product under such separate trade name. 

If a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product fails in clinical development, after milestone payments have been paid based on such development, and development of such Licensed Compound or Licensed Product is terminated (a “Failed Product”), and clinical development of another Licensed Product (the “Replacement Product”) is subsequently commenced to replace such Failed Product, then all such milestone payments made for the Failed Product may be credited against milestone payments due for achievement of milestone events during the development of the Replacement Product. 

^^Royalty Payments. 

^^Magen shall pay Lilly earned royalties as a percentage of Net Sales of Licensed Products. The royalty rate applicable to a particular sale of Licensed Product is determined based on the actual incremental amount of Net Sales, through the date of the sale during the calendar year of sale, under the following schedule: 

Incremental Annual Net Sales      Royalty Rate
$[*] to $[*] million      [*]% of Net Sales
$[*] million to $[*] million      [*]% of Net Sales
$[*] million      [*]% of Net Sales

^^If Magen enters into a license agreement with a Third Person under Patent or other intellectual property rights controlled by such Third Person that claim or cover the manufacture, use or sale of a Licensed Product (a “Third Party License”) and Magen reasonably believes such license is necessary for Magen to research, have researched, develop, have developed, make, have made, use, have used, manufacture, have manufactured, register, have registered, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import and export, distribute, or market Licensed Compounds and Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory, and Magen makes payments to such Third Person under such Third Party License with respect to such Licensed Product, then Magen may credit [*]% of such payment against the royalties payable to Lilly with respect to such Licensed Product, provided that in no event will the applicable royalty payable to Lilly with respect to such Licensed Product be reduced by more than [*]%. Royalty credits accrued but not used to offset royalty payments owed to Lilly may be applied against future royalty obligations based on sales of such Licensed Product. For clarity, the credit referred to above shall not apply to any license that Magen acquires that is preferred by Magen but Magen does not reasonably believe is necessary to the exploitation of such Licensed Product. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^Magen shall pay royalties due under this Section 4.3 concurrently with the remittance of the royalty report in accordance with Section 4.4. For sales of a particular Licensed Product in a particular country (or jurisdiction), royalties shall be owed and payable under this Section 4.3 for such sales during the Royalty Term applicable to such Licensed Product in such country (or jurisdiction). 

^^The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Lilly Patents and Lilly Know-How licensed pursuant to this Agreement justify royalties of differing amounts with respect to sales of the Licensed Product, which royalties could be applied separately to the Licensed Product involving the exercise of such Lilly Patents and/or the incorporation of such Lilly Know-How, and that if such royalties were calculated separately, royalties relating to the Lilly Patents and royalties relating to the Lilly Know-How would last for different terms. In light of such considerations and for reasons of convenience, the Parties have hereby determined that blended royalty rates for the Lilly Patents and the Lily Know-How licensed hereunder will apply during a single Royalty Term and that the utilization of such blended royalty rates is advantageous to both Parties. 

^^**Record Retention, Royalty Reports, and Royalty Payment Schedule.** Magen shall keep (and shall cause its Affiliates and require its sublicensees to keep) complete and accurate books and records that are necessary to ascertain and verify royalty payments owed under Section 4.3. Such records shall be kept in accordance with GAAP and Magen’s or its Permitted Sellers internal practices and procedures, consistently applied. Magen shall furnish Lilly with a quarterly report on Net Sales of Licensed Product occurring in each particular Calendar Quarter, within [*] ([*]) days after the end of the Calendar Quarter. Such report shall include a written report detailing: (i) the Net Sales of Licensed Products for the previous Calendar Quarter, broken down by country and between Magen and any Permitted Sellers, (ii) the royalty payment that is due and payable for the Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter, and (iii) the basis for calculating such royalty payment. Magen will mail such reports to the attention of: [[Lilly]] and Company, Lilly Royalty Administration in Finance, Drop Code 1063, [[Organization 2 Name]], [[Address 3: Address]], 46285. The amount of royalty payment due to Lilly shall be paid by Magen concurrently with the remittance of each royalty report (that is, within [*] ([*]) days of the end of each Calendar Quarter). All amounts payable to Lilly under this Article 4 shall be paid in U.S. dollars by electronic wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Lilly (unless otherwise instructed by Lilly in writing). 

^^**Audits.** Lilly will have the right, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to have such books and records of Magen described in Section 4.4 audited no more than [*] per calendar year so as to verify the accuracy of the information previously reported to Lilly under Section 4.4. Any such audit shall be conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm of national standing selected by Lilly and approved by Magen (which firm may be Magen’s independent certified public accounting firm), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Such audit may cover the period back to the beginning of two (2) full calendar years preceding the date of the request for such audit and may not cover any prior period. Lilly may audit a given period of sales [*]. Such audit right shall continue for [*] ([*]) calendar years following expiration or termination of the Agreement. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

Such accountants will keep confidential any information obtained during such audit and will report to Lilly only their conclusions. The cost of such audit will be borne by [*]; however, if as a result of such audit the Parties agree that the actual amount of royalties owed to Lilly, for the period audited, is more than the amount of royalties paid by Magen for the period that is the subject of the audit by greater than [*] percent ([*]%) of such amount owed, then the cost of the audit will be borne by Magen. Within [*] ([*]) days after both Parties have received a copy of an audit report, Magen or Lilly, as appropriate, will compensate the other Party for payment errors or omissions revealed by the audit. Magen will include in all sublicenses granted in accordance herewith, and any other agreements enabling a Third Person to be a Permitted Seller, an audit provision substantially similar to the foregoing requiring such Permitted Seller to keep full and accurate books and records relating to the Licensed Product and granting Lilly the right to have an independent public accounting firm audit the accuracy of the information reported by the sublicensee in connection therewith. 

^^Taxes And Currency. All payments made under this Agreement shall be in United States dollars. Any and all taxes levied on any payments by Magen under this Agreement shall be the liability of and paid by Lilly. If laws or regulations require the withholding of such taxes, the taxes will be deducted by Magen from the payment and remitted by Magen to the proper tax authority, provided that Magen will furnish Lilly with a copy of the official tax receipt on such withholdings as soon as practicable after such withholding, and give Lilly such assistance, at Lilly’s expense, as may be reasonably necessary to enable or assist Lilly to claim exemption or take credit therefrom. Proof of payment shall be provided to Lilly within [*] ([*]) days after payment. Magen will cooperate, at Lilly’s expense, in pursuing tax refunds, if such refund is appropriate in Lilly’s determination. 

^^Late Payment. Any amounts not paid by Magen when due under this Agreement will be subject to interest from and including the date payment is due through and including the date upon which Lilly has collected the funds in accordance herewith at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) the sum of [*] percent ([*]%) plus the United States prime rate of interest quoted in the Money Rates (or equivalent) section of the *Wall Street Journal* per annum, calculated daily on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year, or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by law. 

\centered INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS 

^^Prosecution and Maintenance of Lilly Patents. 

^^Lilly shall be responsible for the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of all the Lilly Patents (collectively, ***“Patent Responsibilities”***) under this Agreement. During such efforts, Lilly shall be obligated to provide Magen copies of all documents proposed to be filed with a patent office (reasonably in advance of such filing) and all correspondence with any patent office (including office actions and the like) relating to such efforts, to consult with Magen, and to reasonably incorporate Magen’s comments with respect to matters related to prosecution and maintenance of the Lilly Patents, insofar as the prosecution and maintenance of the Lilly Patents may reasonably be considered to affect Magen’s development and commercial interests described herein. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^If Lilly may determine that it no longer desires to fulfill the Patent Responsibilities for any of the Lilly Patents under this Agreement or if Lilly decides to allow any Lilly Patent to lapse or desires to abandon or discontinue prosecution of any Lilly Patent, Lilly shall promptly so notify Magen, and in such case, at Lilly’s sole discretion, either (i) Magen shall thereafter assume such Patent Responsibilities (except as otherwise provided below) as Magen desires with respect to the affected Lilly Patent(s) or (ii) Lilly shall assign the Lilly Patents to Magen (in which case Magen shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to prosecute, maintain and enforce such assigned Patents). Further, if Magen reasonably believes that Lilly is prosecuting any Lilly Patent in a manner that negatively affects Magen’s development and commercial interests, or that Lilly’s inaction is likely to result in the abandonment of any Lilly Patent(s), then, upon Magen’s request, Lilly shall transfer the Patent Responsibilities for such Lilly Patent(s) to Magen or, in Lilly’s sole discretion assign such Lilly Patents to Magen. When Magen assumes any Patent Responsibilities or upon an assignment of the Lilly Patents, Lilly shall provide Magen with all Information and documents concerning the patent portfolio as shall be necessary or helpful to Magen in assuming such Patent Responsibilities or assignment. If Lilly determines to have Magen undertake the Patent Responsibilities, Lilly will irrevocably designate and appoint Magen and its duly authorized officers and agents as Lilly’s agent and attorney-in-fact with respect to the Lilly Patents for which Lilly has transferred Patent Responsibilities to Magen, to act for and in Lilly’s behalf to execute, deliver and file any and all documents with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Lilly. 

^^During the period when Magen is assuming the Patent Responsibilities, Magen shall, within [*] ([*]) days after each calendar year, provide Lilly with a written report describing the status of all Lilly Patents, including the patent country, patent and application numbers, filing date, issue date, expiration date, and any other relevant information reasonably requested by Lilly. Such report shall be mailed to [[Lilly]] and Company, Deputy/Patent General Counsel, Drop Code 1104, [[Organization 2 Name]], [[Address 3: Address]], 46285. 

^^If, after Magen assumes the Patent Responsibilities, Magen decides to allow any Lilly Patent to lapse or wishes to abandon or discontinue prosecution of any Lilly Patent, Magen shall notify Lilly in writing not less than [*] ([*]) days prior to taking such action, and Lilly shall have the right to assume the responsibility for such Lilly Patents. If Lilly does so, then Magen shall surrender to Lilly its rights under Article 2 under the patent or patent application in the country or countries so affected, and Lilly may assume control of the same at Lilly’s sole expense (it being understood that all other rights under the license to such Lilly Patent in other countries and to all other Lilly Patents under Article 2 continue). 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.**

[[Organization 3 Name]] will promptly notify the other of any infringement or suspected infringement that may come to its notice of any intellectual property rights relating to the Licensed Products, including, without limitation, the Lilly Patents and Lilly Know-How, and will provide the other Party with information with respect thereto. If a Third Person infringes or misappropriates any Lilly Patent or Lilly Know-How, Magen (or its Affiliate or sublicensee) will have the first right (but not the obligation), at its own expense, to pursue any and all injunctive relief, and any or all compensatory and other remedies and relief (collectively, ***“Remedies”***), against such Third Person, and Lilly will have the right to participate in such action at its own expense. Should Magen determine not to pursue Remedies with respect to any such infringement or misappropriation of Lilly Patents or Lilly Know-How within [*] ([*]) days after receipt of written notice from Lilly requesting Magen to do so, then Lilly will have the right (but not the obligation), at its own expense, to pursue Remedies against such Third Person, and Magen shall have the right to participate in such action at its own expense. 

^^Assistance and Cooperation. If a Party pursues Remedies hereunder with respect to infringement or misappropriation of Lilly Patents or Lilly Know-How, the other Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with the Party pursuing such Remedies, including joining in any action or providing a power of attorney if necessary. Each Party will bear its own costs and expenses relating to such pursuit. Any damages or other amounts collected will be distributed, first, to the Party that pursued Remedies to cover its costs and expenses; and second, to the other Party to cover its costs and expenses, if any, relating to the pursuit of such Remedies; and any remaining amount will be distributed to the Party that pursued the Remedies, provided that any recovery by Magen attributable to lost sales of Licensed Product shall be deemed Net Sales under this Agreement, occurring at the time such recovery is received by Magen. 

^^Settlement of Litigation. No settlement, consent judgment or other final disposition of an action for infringement or validity may be entered into as to any Lilly Patent or Lilly Know-How without Lilly’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^Infringement of Third Person Rights. If a Third Person institutes a patent, trade secret or other infringement suit against Magen or a Permitted Seller during the term of this Agreement, alleging that the manufacture, marketing, sale, use or importation of a Licensed Product infringes one or more patent or other intellectual property rights held by such Third Person, then Magen (or its Affiliate or sublicensee, as applicable) will have the sole right (but not the obligation), at [*] expense, to assume direction and control of the defense of such claims. Lilly will use all reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with Magen in Magen’s defense of the claims, including providing a power of attorney if necessary. Magen will not have the right to settle or otherwise dispose of any such claim in a manner that materially negatively impacts Lilly’s interest in the Lilly Patents without the consent of Lilly, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^[[Organization 4 Name]]. Magen will be the sole and exclusive owner of [[Organization 4 Name]], with the sole rights, at its discretion, to seek to obtain Patents and other applicable intellectual property protection covering any such [[Organization 4 Name]], at it expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may disclose the terms contained in this Agreement to Third Persons in connection with financing or strategic activities of the Receiving Party as set forth in Section 6.2(f) and as provided in Section 6.4. 

If any Party to this Agreement determines a release of information regarding the existence or terms of this Agreement is required by Applicable Laws, prior to any release of such information, that Party will notify the other Party in writing as soon as practical and provide as much detail as possible in relation to the disclosure required and, where possible under Applicable Laws, will endeavor in good faith to provide the other Party with a minimum of [*] ([*]) business days to review the proposed public statement.

No Transferee shall further Transfer any Payment Rights without the prior written consent of [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]] will remain the party to, and otherwise retain all rights and obligations under, this Agreement, and, as a result, there will be no amendment to this Agreement and no change in the payment procedures or other terms of this Agreement related to the payment of the royalties. Without limiting the foregoing, no Transferee shall have any rights directly against Magen to enforce any of the Payment Rights or any term or provision of this Agreement, and the assignment or sale of Payment Rights shall not impose upon Magen any additional obligations of any kind either to Lilly or to a Transferee. 

Transferee shall be obligated to keep all information disclosed to it confidential in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of normal and customary confidentiality provisions that are at least as restrictive as those of this Article 6. Such confidentiality provisions shall be promptly furnished to Magen and shall name Magen as a third party beneficiary thereof and give Magen the right to enforce the terms thereof.

The failure of an Indemnitee to give notice in the manner provided herein will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 9, except to the extent that such failure to give notice materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such claim. 

^^**Defense of Action.** In case any action that is subject to indemnification under this Article 8 shall be brought against an Indemnitee and it shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate and, if it so desires, to assume the defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee.

^^**Conduct of Defense.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2, the Party conducting the defense of a claim will (1) keep the other Party informed on a reasonable and timely basis as to the status of the defense of such claim (but only to the extent such other Party is not participating jointly in the defense of such claim), and (2) conduct the defense of such claim in a prudent manner.

Each Indemnified Party’s rights under this Article 8 will not be deemed to have been waived or otherwise affected by such Indemnified Party’s waiver of the breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in or made pursuant this Agreement, unless such waiver expressly and in writing also waives any or all of the Indemnified Party’s right under this Article 8.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, once Magen (or its Affiliate or sublicensee) has obtained Regulatory Approval and commenced commercial sales of a Licensed Product, Lilly may not terminate this Agreement based on the uncured breach of Magen *except for* uncured material breach of Magen’s payment obligations under this Agreement. Lilly shall retain, however, all other remedies and rights at law and at equity with respect to any breach by Magen. 

^^Termination for Bankruptcy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the extent enforceable under applicable law Lilly may terminate this Agreement in its entirety with immediate effect if Magen: 

^^makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; 

^^petitions for or acquiesces in the appointment of any receiver, trustee or similar officer to liquidate or conserve its business or any substantial part of its assets; 

^^commences under the laws of any jurisdiction any proceeding for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended (“Code”) or similar bankruptcy laws in applicable jurisdictions, involving its insolvency, reorganization, adjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or any other similar proceeding for the release of financially distressed debtors; or 

^^becomes a party to any proceeding or action of the type described above in (c), and such proceeding or action remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than [*] ([*]) days. 

^^Rights Upon Termination by Lilly. If Lilly terminates this Agreement under Section 9.2, 9.3 or 10.3, then the following will take effect upon the effective date of such termination: 

^^Reversion of Lilly Patents and Lilly Know-How and Termination or Assignment of Sublicenses. All rights under the Lilly Patents and the Lilly Know-How granted by Lilly to Magen pursuant to Article 2 will terminate and all rights granted therein will immediately revert to Lilly with no further notice or action required on Lilly’s behalf; provided, however, that if the termination relates only to a specific country, then only the license pertaining to such country will revert to Lilly hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any sublicense granted by Magen hereunder that is in compliance with the terms of Section 2.2: (i) to one pharmaceutical or biotechnology company having a market capitalization of at least [*] dollars ($[*]) pursuant to which such sublicensee acquires rights to commercialize and/or distribute Licensed Products worldwide (which may exclude [*]) or in at least [*], and (ii) to one pharmaceutical or biotechnology company having a market capitalization of at least [*] dollars ($[*]) to which such sublicensee acquires rights to commercialize and/or distribute Licensed Products in [*] (including at least [*] and [*]) or [*] (including at least [*]) shall survive any such termination and shall automatically be assigned by Magen to Lilly such that such sublicense becomes a direct license between Lilly and such sublicensee if such sublicensee cures the breach that gave rise to the termination of this Agreement by Lilly. Any other sublicense granted by Magen hereunder shall at Lilly’s sole discretion, either be terminated, or if agreed to by Lilly in writing, assigned by Magen to Lilly such that they become direct licenses between Lilly and the applicable sublicensee. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^Reversion of Patent Maintenance Responsibilities. Upon the effective date of the termination of this Agreement, the sole responsibility for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the Lilly Patents will revert back to Lilly with no further notice or action required on Lilly’s behalf; provided, however, that if the termination relates only to a specific country, then only the patent maintenance obligations pertaining to such country will revert to Lilly hereunder. In such case, Magen will maintain its Patent Responsibilities for all other Lilly Patents. 

^^Transfer of Regulatory Documents. To the extent requested by Lilly, Magen shall promptly thereafter transfer possession and the exclusive license under (and shall cause all contractors used by Magen to provide services hereunder to transfer possession and license) to Lilly (and in Lilly’s name where appropriate) of all Clinical Trial data and information, all Clinical Trial databases, all data generated in support of Marketing Applications, Regulatory Approvals or other regulatory commitments (*e.g.*, toxicology and stability data) and regulatory documents (including any correspondence between Magen and any sublicensee or contractor of Magen and any regulatory agency relating thereto) that were created and/or developed under the terms of this Agreement for Licensed Compound or Licensed Product (collectively, the ***“Regulatory Documents”***). Lilly shall compensate Magen for its access to and use of such Regulatory Documents, in accordance with the agreed terms as above. Should Lilly elect to sublicense, or to co-market or co-promote Licensed Product with a Third Person in the Territory, Lilly shall have the right to provide appropriate access to such Clinical Trial data or information, Clinical Trial databases, all data generated in support of any Marketing Application, Regulatory Approval other regulatory commitment, or Regulatory Document to such Third Person, subject to payment of the compensation amounts as agreed for any such access and use by such Third Person. 

^^Termination by Magen**.** 

^^Magen may terminate this Agreement at any time upon [*] ([*]) days written notice to Lilly, if the results of any development program for a Licensed Product, in Magen’s sole judgment, do not warrant further development work, or for any safety, toxicity or efficacy issues in Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^Upon any material breach of this Agreement by Lilly, Magen may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon [*] ([*]) days written notice to Lilly. Such termination shall become effective at the end of such [*] ([*]) day period unless Lilly cures such breach or violation during such [*] ([*]) day period; provided, however, in the case of a breach or violation that cannot be cured within such [*] ([*]) day period, Magen may terminate this Agreement following such [*] ([*]) day period only if Lilly shall have failed to commence substantial remedial actions within such [*] ([*]) day period and to use best efforts to pursue the same. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the extent enforceable under applicable law Magen may terminate this Agreement in its entirety with immediate effect if Lilly: 

^^^makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; 

^^^petitions for or acquiesces in the appointment of any receiver, trustee or similar officer to liquidate or conserve its business or any substantial part of its assets; 

^^^commences under the laws of any jurisdiction any proceeding for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended (“Code”) or similar bankruptcy laws in applicable jurisdictions, involving its insolvency, reorganization, adjustment of debt, dissolution, liquidation or any other similar proceeding for the release of financially distressed debtors; or 

^^^becomes a party to any proceeding or action of the type described above in (iii), and such proceeding or action remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of more than [*] ([*]) days. 

^^If Magen terminates this Agreement under Section 9.5(a), then the terms of Section 9.4 shall apply. If Magen terminates this Agreement under Section 9.5(b) or (c), or 10.3, then Magen shall retain any and all licenses and other rights granted to it by Lilly pursuant to this Agreement (unless otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), and Magen’s payment obligations under Article 4 and other relevant provisions shall continue in full force and effect, but all of Magen’s obligations to use Diligent Efforts under the terms of the Agreement will terminate. 

^^Residual Obligation Upon Termination. Termination of this Agreement for any reason will not relieve either Party of any obligation or liability accruing prior thereto, including the payment of any milestone payments or royalties amounts, which have accrued as of the date of termination or expiration and will be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of either Party with respect to any antecedent breach of the provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to the foregoing and the rights upon termination set forth in Sections 9.3 and 9.4, no termination of this Agreement, whether by lapse of time or otherwise, will serve to terminate the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto with respect to this Agreement as it relates to the jurisdiction(s) for which this Agreement has not been terminated. The provisions of Articles 6, 8, and 10 and Sections 4.5, 5.6, 5.7, 7.5, 9.43, 9.5, 9.6, and 9.7 are intended to and shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

^^Additional Remedies. The remedies set forth in this Article 9 or elsewhere in this Agreement will be in addition to, and will not be to the exclusion of, any other remedies available to the Parties at law, in equity or under this Agreement. 

\centered MISCELLANEOUS 

^^**Independent Contractor.** It is understood and agreed that the Parties shall have the status of an independent contractor under this Agreement and that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any partnership, joint venture or employer-employee relationship between the Parties or as authorization for either Magen or Lilly to act as agent for the other. 

^^**No Benefit to Others.** The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties and their legal representatives, successors and assigns, and they shall not be construed as conferring any rights to any Third Person. 

^^**Force Majeure.** If either Party is affected by any extraordinary, unexpected and unavoidable event such as acts of God, floods, fires, riots, war, labor disturbances, failures of sources of supply, infectious diseases of animals, or by the reason of any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand or requirement of the relevant government or any authority or representative thereof, or by reason of any other cause whatsoever (provided that in all such cases the Party claiming relief on account of such event can demonstrate that such event was extraordinary, unexpected and unavoidable by the exercise of reasonable care) (***“Force Majeure”***) it shall notify the other Party within [*] ([*]) business days of the nature and extent thereof and take all reasonable steps to overcome the Force Majeure and to minimize the loss occasioned to that other Party. Such notice will be provided within [*] ([*]) business days of the occurrence of such event and will identify the requirements of this Agreement or such of its obligations as may be affected, and, subject to the provisions below, to the extent so affected, said obligations will be suspended during the period of such disability. The Party prevented from performing hereunder will use reasonable efforts to remove such disability and will continue performance whenever such causes are removed. The Party so affected will give to the other Party a good faith estimate of the continuing effect of the Force Majeure condition and the duration of the affected Party’s nonperformance. 

If the period of any previous actual nonperformance of Lilly because of Lilly Force Majeure conditions plus the anticipated future period of Lilly nonperformance because of such conditions will exceed an aggregate of [*] ([*]) consecutive days within any one year period, Magen may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice to Lilly. 

**[*] Confidential treatment requested; certain information omitted and filed separately with the SEC.** 

If the period of any previous actual nonperformance of Magen because of Magen Force Majeure conditions will exceed [*] ([*]) consecutive days, Lilly may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice to Magen; provided, however, that to the extent such nonperformance by Magen affects Magen’s performance and Lilly’s rights under this Agreement as it relates to one or more countries, but not all countries, Lilly may terminate this Agreement after such [*] ([*]) day period as to the affected country or countries only, and in such case this Agreement will remain in full force and effect with respect to the countries that are not terminated. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, when such circumstances as those contemplated herein arise, the Parties will discuss in good faith, what, if any, modification of the terms set forth herein may be required in order to arrive at an equitable solution. 

^^**Amendment.** This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed by authorized representatives of the Parties. 

^^**Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications, proposals, representations and agreements, whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

^^**Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws effective while this Agreement remains in effect, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected thereby. 

^^**Waiver.** Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument executed by such Party. No delay on the part of Lilly or Magen in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any waiver on the part of either Lilly or Magen of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege hereunder nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. 

^^**Notices.** All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon receipt if delivered personally or by facsimile transmission (receipt verified), telexed, mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, or sent by prepaid express courier service, to the Parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a Party as shall be specified by the notice; provided, that notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon receipt thereof):

^^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, excluding any choice of law rules, which may direct the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. However, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patents encompassed within the scope of this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the applicable laws of the countries in which such patents have issued. 

^^**Assignability.** During the term of this Agreement, neither Party shall assign any benefit or burden under this Agreement without prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that (i) either Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate or to any company with which it may merge or consolidate or to any company to whom it may transfer substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates or to any company which may acquire such Party (including, in each case, any company created as a new vehicle upon any such merger, transfer or acquisition), (ii) Magen may transfer any and all of its rights to a sublicensee as provided by this Agreement and (iii) subject to Article 4, Lilly may freely assign its Payment Rights in whole or in part.

^^Dispute Resolution. If any dispute arises relating to this Agreement, prior to instituting any lawsuit or other dispute resolution process on account of such dispute, the Parties will, prior to initiating any legal action, attempt in good faith to settle such dispute first by negotiation and consultation between themselves, including referral of such dispute to the Chief Executive Officer of Magen and the Sr Vice President Corporate Strategy and [[Organization 6 Name]]. If such executives are unable to resolve such dispute or agree upon a mechanism to resolve such dispute within [*] ([*]) days of the first written request for dispute resolution under this Section 10.13, the Parties may then either consider other forms of alternative dispute resolution as a means of resolving any such dispute or institute litigation and seek such remedies as may be available. 

^^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart hereof to produce or account for any of the other counterparts. 

^^Schedules, Exhibits and Attachments. All schedules, exhibits and attachments (including, without limitation, the Development Plan) referred to herein are intended to be and hereby are specifically made part of this Agreement.
