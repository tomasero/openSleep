Dear Sirs/Mesdames:

We consent to the use, through incorporation by reference in the Prospectus, of our report dated [[Date 2: Date]] to the unitholders of [[Organization 3 Name]] (the “Trust”) on the following financial statements:

Consolidated balance sheets as at [[Date 3: Date]] and 2008; and

Consolidated statements of earnings and retained earnings (deficit), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flow for each of the years in the three-year period ended [[Date 3]].

We also consent to the incorporation by reference in the Prospectus of our report to the Board of Directors of 1521500 Alberta Ltd. on the balance sheet of 1521500 Alberta Ltd. as at [[Date 4: Date]]. Our report is dated [[Date 4]].

We report that we have read the Prospectus and all information specifically incorporated by reference therein and have no reason to believe that there are any misrepresentations in the information contained therein that are derived from the financial statements upon which we have reported or that are within our knowledge as a result of our audits of such financial statements.
