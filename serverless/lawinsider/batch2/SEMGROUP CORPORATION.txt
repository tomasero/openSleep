THIS AGREEMENT dated as of the day of [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Agreement Date”) is made by and between [[Executive]], a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (“[[Organization 1 Name]]”, together with its subsidiaries, affiliates and successors thereto), and (“Executive”).

The Board of Directors of [[Organization 1 Name]] has determined that it is in the best interests of [[Organization 1 Name]] and its stockholders to encourage and motivate the Executive to devote his full attention to the performance of his assigned duties without the distraction of concerns regarding his involuntary or constructive termination of employment for the reasons specified in this Agreement. The Executive is employed by [[Organization 1 Name]] or a Subsidiary and may from time to time be employed by one or more Subsidiaries. [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Subsidiaries believe that it is in the best interest of the Executive, their customers, the communities they serve, and the stockholders of [[Organization 1 Name]] to provide financial assistance through severance payments and other benefits to Executive if Executive is involuntarily or constructively terminated for the reasons specified in this Agreement.

^^^during a Post-Change Period, failure to meet performance goals, objectives or measures following good faith efforts to meet such goals, objectives or measures; and 

further provided that, for purposes of clauses (b) through (e) if an act, or a failure to act, which was done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and with a reasonable belief, after reasonable investigation, that Executive’s act, or failure to act, was in the best interests of [[Organization 1 Name]], the Subsidiary or an Affiliate or was required by applicable law or administrative regulation, such breach shall not constitute Cause if, within 10 business days after Executive is given written notice of such breach that specifically refers to this Section, Executive cures such breach to the fullest extent that it is curable. With respect to the above definition of “cause”, no act or conduct by Executive will constitute “cause” if Executive acted: (i) in accordance with the instructions or advice of counsel representing [[Organization 1 Name]] or if there was a conflict such that Executive could not consult with counsel representing [[Organization 1 Name]], other qualified counsel, or (ii) as required by legal process.

^^approval by the stockholders of [[Organization 1 Name]] of a plan or agreement for the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of [[Organization 1 Name]] or a plan of complete liquidation of [[Organization 1 Name]], other than any such transaction that would result in: (i) a Related Party owning or acquiring more than [[Percentage 4: Number]]% of the assets owned by [[Organization 1 Name]] immediately prior to the transaction, or (ii) the Persons who were the direct or indirect owners of the outstanding common stock and Voting Securities of [[Organization 1 Name]] immediately before such transaction becoming, immediately after the consummation of such transaction, the direct or indirect owners, of more than [[Percentage 4]]% of the assets owned by [[Organization 1 Name]] immediately prior to the transaction. 

Notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, a Change in Control shall not occur with respect to Executive if, in advance of such event, Executive agrees in writing that such event shall not constitute a Change in Control.

^^the members of the Board on the date of such determination who have been members of the Board since such baseline date, and

^^“[[Organization 1 Name]] Parties” means [[Organization 1 Name]] and Executive’s Employer. 

^^“Separation from Service” means an Executive’s termination or deemed termination from employment with [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of determining whether a Separation from Service has occurred, the employment relationship is treated as continuing intact while the Executive is on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long as the Executive retains a right to reemployment with his employer under an applicable statute or by contract. For this purpose, a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Executive will return to perform services for his employer. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the Executive does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a leave of absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, and such impairment causes the Executive to be unable to perform the duties of the Executive’s position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a 29 month period of absence shall be substituted for such six month period. For purposes of this Agreement, a Separation from Service occurs at the date as of which the facts and circumstances indicate either that, after such date: (A) the Executive and [[Organization 1 Name]] reasonably anticipate the Executive will perform no further services for [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Subsidiaries (whether as an employee or an independent contractor), or (B) that the level of bona fide services the Executive will perform for [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Affiliates (whether as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36 month period or, if the Executive has been providing services to [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Subsidiaries for less than 36 months, the full period over which the Executive has rendered services, whether as an employee or independent contractor. The determination of whether a Separation from Service has occurred shall be governed by the provisions of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1, as amended, taking into account the objective facts and circumstances with respect to the level of bona fide services performed by the Executive after a certain date. 

^^“Severance Period” see Section 2.1(c). 

^^“Stock Options” means stock options, stock appreciation rights or similar awards. 

^^“Subsidiary” means a corporation, trade or business, if it and [[Organization 1 Name]] are members of a controlled group of corporations as defined in Code Section 414(b) or under common control as defined under Code Section 414(c); the standard of control under Code Sections 414(b) and 414(c) shall be deemed to be “at least [[Percentage 7: Number]]%” and all determinations shall be made in accordance with Code Section 409A and the applicable guidance thereunder. 

^^“Surviving Corporation” means the parent corporation resulting from a Reorganization Transaction or, if securities representing at least [[Percentage 4]]% of the aggregate voting power of all Voting Securities of a corporation affected by a Change in Control, which is not a Reorganization Transaction, are directly or indirectly owned by another corporation, such other corporation. 

^^“Target Annual Bonus” means, as of any date, the amount equal to the product of Executive’s Base Salary determined as of such date multiplied by the percentage of such Base Salary to which Executive would have been entitled immediately prior to such date under any Annual Bonus arrangement for the fiscal year for which the Annual Bonus is awarded if the performance goals established pursuant to such Annual Bonus were achieved at the [[Percentage 8: Number]]% level as of the end of the fiscal year; provided, however, that if Executive’s Annual Bonus is discretionary and no [[Percentage 8]]% target level is formally established either under the Annual Bonus arrangement or otherwise, Executive’s “Target Annual Bonus” shall mean the amount equal to [[Percentage 8]]% of Executive’s Base Salary. 

^^“Taxes” means federal, state, local and other income, employment and other taxes. 

^^“Termination Date” means the date of the receipt of the Notice of Termination by Executive (if such notice is given by Executive’s Employer) or by Executive’s Employer (if such notice is given by Executive), or any later date, not more than 30 days after the giving of such notice, specified in such notice; provided, however, that: 

^^if Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Termination Date shall be the date of Executive’s death or the date of deemed termination of employment due to Disability, as applicable, regardless of whether a Notice of Termination has been given; and 

^^if no Notice of Termination is given, the Termination Date shall be the last date on which Executive is employed by an Employer; and 

^^for purposes of Article IV (Restrictive Covenants) if the Executive does not have a Separation from Service, the Termination Date shall be the later of the date the entity that employs Executive ceases to be a Subsidiary, or, after a Disaggregation (as defined in Section 1.21), the date Executive’s employment with the successor business unit terminates, whether such termination is initiated by such successor or by Executive. 

^^“Voting Securities” of a corporation means securities of such corporation that are entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of such corporation. 

^^“Work Product” means any and all work product, including, but not limited to, documentation, tools, templates, processes, procedures, discoveries, inventions, innovations, technical data, concepts, know-how, methodologies, methods, drawings, prototypes, trade secrets, notebooks, reports, findings, business plans, recommendations and memoranda of every description, that Executive makes, conceives, discovers or develops alone or with others during the course of Executive’s employment with [[Organization 1 Name]] or during the one year period following Executive’s Termination Date (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights). 

\centered **[[Organization 1 Name]]’S OBLIGATIONS UPON SEPARATION FROM SERVICE** 

^^If By Executive for Good Reason or By an Employer Other Than for Cause, Disability, Death or Disqualifying Disaggregation During the Post-Change Period. If Executive has a Separation from Service for Good Reason or there is an Employer-initiated Separation from Service of the Executive for any reason other than Cause, Disability, Death or a Disqualifying Disaggregation during the Post-Change Period, then in addition to payment of all Accrued Obligations, which shall be payable no later than 10 business days after the Termination Date, [[Organization 1 Name]]’s and the Employer’s sole obligations to Executive under this Article II shall be as follows: 

^^Severance Payments. Executive shall be paid a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of the following, on the first business day following six months after Executive’s Separation from Service: 

^^^Annual Bonus for Fiscal Year Prior to Year of Termination. If the Termination Date occurs after the end of a fiscal year but before the Annual Bonus with respect to such fiscal year is fully paid out, the Annual Bonus for such prior fiscal year shall be paid to Executive, but the payment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any Annual Bonus previously paid to Executive with respect to such prior fiscal year; and 

^^^Multiple of Salary and Bonus. An amount equal to two (2) times the sum of: (A) Base Salary plus (B) the Target Annual Bonus, each determined as of the Termination Date; provided, however, that any reduction in Executive’s Base Salary or Target Annual Bonus that would qualify as Good Reason shall be disregarded for this purpose. 

^^Stock Incentive Awards. All of Executive’s Stock Options and Restricted Shares then outstanding shall only vest and payout in accordance with the applicable award agreements for such Stock Options and Restricted Shares.

^^Outplacement.

^^Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance. For a period of six years after the Termination Date (or for any known longer applicable statute of limitations period), the Executive shall be entitled to coverage under a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy in an amount no less than, and on the same terms as those provided to peer executive officers and directors of the Employer. 

^^If By an Employer Other Than for Cause, Disability or Death Prior to the Post-Change Period. If there is an Employer-initiated Separation from Service of the Executive for any reason other than Cause, Disability or Death prior to the Post-Change Period, then in addition to payment of all Accrued Obligations, which shall be payable no later than 30 business days after the Termination Date, [[Organization 1 Name]]’s and the Employer’s sole obligations to Executive under this Article II shall be as follows: 

^^Severance Payments. Executive shall be paid a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of the following, on the first business day following six months after Executive’s Separation from Service: 

^^^Annual Bonus for Fiscal Year Prior to Year of Termination. If the Termination Date occurs after the end of a fiscal year but before the Annual Bonus with respect to such fiscal year is fully paid out, the Annual Bonus for such prior fiscal year shall be paid to Executive, but the payment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any Annual Bonus previously paid to Executive with respect to such prior fiscal year; and 

^^^Multiple of Salary and Bonus. An amount equal to one (1) times the sum of: (A) Base Salary plus (B) the Target Annual Bonus, each determined as of the Termination Date.

^^If by the Employer for Cause. 

^^Termination for Cause. If the Executive has a Separation from Service for Cause, the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties’ sole obligation to Executive under this Article II shall be to pay Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations determined as of the Termination Date. 

^^Change in Control: Procedural Requirements for Termination for Cause. For any Separation from Service for Cause during any part of a Post-Change Period, the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties shall strictly observe each of the following substantive and procedural provisions: 

^^^The Board shall call a meeting for the stated purpose of determining whether Executive’s acts or omissions satisfy the requirements of the definition of “Cause” and, if so, whether to terminate Executive’s employment for Cause. 

^^^Not less than 15 days prior to the date of such meeting, the Board shall provide or cause to be provided Executive and each member of the Board written notice (a “Notice of Consideration”) of: (A) a detailed description of the acts or omissions alleged to constitute Cause, (B) the date of such meeting of the Board, and (C) Executive’s rights under clauses (iii) and (iv) below. 

^^^Executive shall have the opportunity to present to the Board a written response to the Notice of Consideration, but shall not have the right to appear in person or by counsel before the Board. 

^^^Executive’s employment may be terminated for Cause only if: (A) the acts or omissions specified in the Notice of Consideration did in fact occur and such actions or omissions do constitute Cause as defined in this Agreement, (B) the Board, by affirmative vote of a simple majority of its members, makes a specific determination to such effect and to the effect that Executive’s employment should be terminated for Cause (“Cause Determination”), and (C) [[Organization 1 Name]] thereafter provides Executive with a Notice of Termination that specifies in specific detail the basis of such Separation from Service for Cause and which Notice shall be consistent with the reasons set forth in the Notice of Consideration. 

^^In the event that the existence of Cause shall become an issue in any action or proceeding between Executive, on the one hand, and any one or more of the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties, on the other hand, the Cause Determination shall be final and binding on all parties, except as provided in Section 2.3(c) below. 

Nothing in this Section 2.3(b) shall preclude the Board, by majority vote, from suspending Executive from his duties, with pay, at any time. 

^^Change in Control: Standard of Review. In the event that the existence of Cause during a Post-Change Period shall become an issue in any action or proceeding between Executive, on the one hand, and any one or more of the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties on the other hand, the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties, as applicable, shall, notwithstanding the Cause Determination, have the burden of establishing that the actions or omissions specified in the Notice of Consideration did in fact occur and do constitute Cause and that the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties have satisfied all applicable substantive and procedural requirements of this Section. 

^^If by an Executive Other Than for Good Reason. If Executive has a Separation from Service initiated by the Executive other than for Good Reason, Disability or death, the sole obligation of the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties to Executive under this Article II shall be to pay Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations determined as of the Termination Date. 

^^If by Death or Disability. If Executive dies or if Executive has a Separation from Service by reason of Executive’s Disability, the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties’ sole obligation to Executive under this Article II shall be to pay Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to all Accrued Obligations determined as of the Termination Date. 

^^Waiver and Release. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Executive’s employment terminates pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, no [[Organization 1 Name]] Party shall have any obligation to Executive under Sections 2.1(a)-(e) or 2.2(a)-(d), as the case may be, unless and until Executive executes and delivers to [[Organization 1 Name]] within 60 days after Separation from Service a release and waiver of [[Organization 1 Name]], the Employer and Affiliates, in substantially the same form as attached hereto as Exhibit A, or as otherwise mutually acceptable. 

^^Breach of Covenants. If a court determines that Executive has breached any non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, confidential information or intellectual property covenant entered into at any time between Executive (on the one hand) and [[Organization 1 Name]], the Employer, or any Affiliate (on the other hand), including the Restrictive Covenants in Article IV, (a) no [[Organization 1 Name]] Party shall have any obligation to pay or provide any severance or benefits under Article II, (b) all of Executive’s unexercised Stock Options shall terminate as of the date of the breach, (c) all of Executive’s unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited as of the date of the breach, (d) Executive shall reimburse a [[Organization 1 Name]] Party for any amount already paid under Article II, and (e) Executive shall repay to [[Organization 1 Name]] an amount equal to the aggregate “spread” (as defined below) on all Stock Options, if any, exercised in the one year period prior to the first date on which Executive breached any such covenant (“Breach Date”). For purposes of this Section 2.7, “spread” in respect of any Stock Option shall mean the product of the number of shares as to which such Stock Option has been exercised during the one year period prior to the Breach Date multiplied by the difference between the closing price of the Class A common stock on the exercise date (or if the Class A common stock did not trade on the exercise date on the principal stock exchange on which the Class A common stock is then listed or if not so listed in the over-the-counter market, the most recent date on which the Class A common stock did so trade) and the exercise price of the Stock Options. 

^^Code Section 280G Cutback. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid under Section 2.1 of this Agreement would be an “excess parachute payment” (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any successor provision thereto) but for the application of this sentence, then the payment to be paid or provided under this Agreement will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment, as so reduced, constitutes an excess parachute payment. Whether requested by Executive or the Company, the determination of whether any reduction in such payment or benefit to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made at the expense of the Company by the Company’s independent accountants. The fact that Executive’s right to payment or benefit may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 2.8 will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any rights Executive has other than pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Agreement is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 2.8, the Company will reduce Executive’s payment and/or benefit, to the extent required, in the following order: (i) the lump sum payment described in Section 2.1(a), (ii) the health continuation benefits set forth in Section 2.1(c), and (iii) the outplacement benefit described in Section 2.1(d). 

\centered **NO SET-OFF OR MITIGATION** 

^^No Set-off by [[Organization 1 Name]]. Executive’s right to receive when due the payments and other benefits provided for under this Agreement is absolute, unconditional and subject to no setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or other claim, right or action that any [[Organization 1 Name]] Party may have against Executive or others, except as expressly provided in this Section or as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, any [[Organization 1 Name]] Party shall have the right to deduct any amounts outstanding on any loans or other extensions of credit to Executive from a [[Organization 1 Name]] Party from Executive’s payments and other benefits (if any) provided for under this Agreement. Time is of the essence in the performance by the [[Organization 1 Name]] Parties of their respective obligations under this Agreement. 

^^No Mitigation. Executive shall not have any duty to mitigate the amounts payable by any [[Organization 1 Name]] Party under this Agreement by seeking new employment or self-employment following termination. Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, all amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid without reduction regardless of any amounts of salary, compensation or other amounts which may be paid or payable to Executive as the result of Executive’s employment by another employer or self-employment. 

\centered **RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS** 

^^Confidential and Proprietary Information. The Executive acknowledges that in the course of performing services for [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Affiliates, Executive may create (alone or with others), learn of, have access to, or receive Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined in Section 1.19). The Executive recognizes that all such Confidential and Proprietary Information is the sole and exclusive property of [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Affiliates or of third parties to which [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate owes a duty of confidentiality, that it is [[Organization 1 Name]]’s policy to safeguard and keep confidential all such Confidential and Proprietary Information, and that disclosure of Confidential and Proprietary Information to an unauthorized third party would cause irreparable damage to [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Affiliates. Executive agrees that, except as required by the duties of Executive’s employment with [[Organization 1 Name]] or any of its Affiliates and except in connection with enforcing Executive’s rights under this Agreement or if compelled by a court or governmental agency, in each case provided that prior written notice is given to [[Organization 1 Name]], Executive will not, without the written consent of [[Organization 1 Name]], willfully disseminate or otherwise disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential and Proprietary Information disclosed to Executive or otherwise obtained by Executive during his employment with [[Organization 1 Name]] or its Affiliates, and will take all necessary precautions to prevent disclosure, to any unauthorized individual or entity (whether or not such individual or entity is employed or engaged by, or is otherwise affiliated with, [[Organization 1 Name]] or any Affiliate), and will use the Confidential and Proprietary Information solely for the benefit of [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Affiliates and will not use the Confidential and Proprietary Information for the benefit of any other Person nor permit its use for the benefit of Executive. These obligations shall continue during and after the termination of Executive’s employment for any reason and for so long as the Confidential and Proprietary Information remains Confidential and Proprietary Information. 

^^Non-Competition. During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Termination Date, regardless of the reason for Executive’s Separation from Service, Executive agrees that without the written consent of [[Organization 1 Name]] Executive shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, in any capacity: 

^^engage or participate in, become employed by, serve as a director of, or render advisory or consulting or other services in connection with, any Competitive Business; provided, however, that after Executive’s Separation from Service, this Section 4.2 shall not preclude Executive from: (i) being an employee of, or consultant to, any business unit of a Competitive Business if: (A) such business unit does not qualify as a Competitive Business in its own right, and (B) Executive does not have any direct or indirect involvement in, or responsibility for, any operations of such Competitive Business that cause it to qualify as a Competitive Business, or (ii) with the approval of [[Organization 1 Name]], being a consultant to, an advisor to, a director of, or an employee of a Competitive Business; or 

^^make or retain any financial investment, whether in the form of equity or debt, or own any interest, in any Competitive Business. Nothing in this subsection (b) shall, however, restrict Executive from making an investment in any Competitive Business if such investment does not: (i) represent more than [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of the aggregate market value of the outstanding capital stock or debt (as applicable) of such Competitive Business, (ii) give Executive any right or ability, directly or indirectly, to control or influence the policy decisions or management of such Competitive Business, or (iii) create a conflict of interest between Executive’s duties to [[Organization 1 Name]] and its Affiliates or under this Agreement and his interest in such investment. 

^^Non-Solicitation. During the period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Termination Date, regardless of the reason for Executive’s Separation from Service, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly: 

^^other than in connection with the good-faith performance of his duties as an officer of [[Organization 1 Name]] or its Affiliates, cause or attempt to cause any employee, director or consultant of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate to terminate his relationship with [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate; 

^^solicit the employment or engagement as a consultant or adviser, of any employee of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate (other than by [[Organization 1 Name]] or its Affiliates), or cause or attempt to cause any Person to do any of the foregoing; 

^^establish (or take preliminary steps to establish) a business with, or cause or attempt to cause others to establish (or take preliminary steps to establish) a business with, any employee of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate, if such business is or will be a Competitive Business; or 

^^solicit the purchase or sale of goods, services or combination of goods and services from the established customers of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate. For the purpose of this provision, “established customers” shall be deemed to include any entity or person which has been a customer or supplier of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate within twelve (12) months of the date of cessation of Executive’s employment with [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate. 

^^Intellectual Property. 

^^During the period of Executive’s employment with [[Organization 1 Name]] or any Affiliate, and thereafter upon [[Organization 1 Name]]’s request, regardless of the reason for Executive’s Separation from Service, Executive shall disclose immediately to [[Organization 1 Name]] all Work Product that: (i) relates to the business of [[Organization 1 Name]] or any Affiliate or any customer or supplier to [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate or that may be used in relation therewith; or (ii) results from tasks or projects assigned to Executive by [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate; or (iii) results from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate. Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of [[Organization 1 Name]] and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a “work made for hire” within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. If and to the extent that any such Work Product is not a “work made for hire” within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, Executive hereby assigns, and agrees to assign, to [[Organization 1 Name]] all right, title and interest in and to the Work Product and all copies thereof, and all copyrights, patent rights, trademark rights, trade secret rights and all other proprietary and intellectual property rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due, or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, [[Organization 1 Name]] agrees and acknowledges that the provisions of Section 4.4(a) relating to ownership and disclosure of Work Product do not apply to any inventions or other subject matter for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate was used and that are developed entirely on Executive’s own time, unless: (i) the invention or other subject matter relates: (a) to the business of [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate, or (b) to the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of [[Organization 1 Name]] or any Affiliate, or (ii) the invention or other subject matter results from any work performed by Executive for [[Organization 1 Name]] or any Affiliate. 

^^Executive agrees that, upon disclosure of Work Product to [[Organization 1 Name]], Executive will, during his employment by [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of [[Organization 1 Name]], execute all such documents and perform all such acts as [[Organization 1 Name]] or an Affiliate (or their respective duly authorized agents) may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of [[Organization 1 Name]] alone (unless [[Organization 1 Name]] otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other intellectual property protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to prosecute or defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other intellectual property protection, or otherwise in respect of the Work Product. 

^^In the event that [[Organization 1 Name]] is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executive’s execution of such documents as provided in Section 4.4(c), whether because of Executive’s physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints [[Organization 1 Name]] and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance and protection of letters patent, copyright and other intellectual property protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive. 

^^Non-Disparagement. 

^^Executive agrees not to make, or cause to be made, any statement, observation or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, directly or indirectly) that: (i) accuses or implies that [[Organization 1 Name]] and/or any of its Affiliates, together with their respective present or former officers, directors, partners, stockholders, employees and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns, engaged in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct, whether relating to Executive’s employment (or the termination thereof), the business or operations of [[Organization 1 Name]], or otherwise; or (ii) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects adversely upon the business or reputation of [[Organization 1 Name]] and/or any of its Affiliates, together with their respective present or former officers, directors, partners, stockholders, employees and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns. 

^^[[Organization 1 Name]] agrees not to authorize any statement, observation or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, direct or indirect) that: (i) accuses or implies that Executive engaged in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct relating to Executive’s employment or termination thereof with [[Organization 1 Name]], or otherwise; or (ii) disparages, impugns or in any way reflects adversely upon the reputation of Executive. 

^^Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude Executive or [[Organization 1 Name]] from providing truthful testimony or information pursuant to subpoena, court order or other similar legal or regulatory process, provided, that to the extent permitted by law, Executive will promptly inform [[Organization 1 Name]] of any such obligation prior to participating in any such proceedings. 

^^Reasonableness of Restrictive Covenants. 

^^Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained in this Agreement are reasonable in the scope of the activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are reasonably necessary to protect [[Organization 1 Name]]’s legitimate interests in its Confidential and Proprietary Information, its proprietary work, and in its relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and agents. 

^^[[Organization 1 Name]] has, and Executive has had an opportunity to, consult with their respective legal counsel and to be advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants. Executive acknowledges that his observance of the covenants contained herein will not deprive Executive of the ability to earn a livelihood or to support his dependents. 

^^Executive understands he is bound by the terms of this Article IV, whether or not he receives severance payments under this Agreement or otherwise. 

^^Right to Injunction: Survival of Undertakings. 

^^In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential and Proprietary Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by this Agreement, Executive and [[Organization 1 Name]] agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which [[Organization 1 Name]] would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations hereunder. Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of this Agreement would irreparably injure [[Organization 1 Name]]. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which [[Organization 1 Name]] may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of any provision of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other security therefor, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that [[Organization 1 Name]] has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach. 

^^If a court determines that any covenant included in this Article IV is unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant’s duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so modified to be enforceable. 

^^All of the provisions of this Agreement shall survive any Separation from Service of Executive, without regard to the reasons for such termination. Notwithstanding Section 2.7, in addition to any other rights it may have, neither [[Organization 1 Name]] nor any Affiliate shall have any obligation to pay or provide severance or other benefits (except as may be required under ERISA) after the Termination Date if Executive has materially breached any of Executive’s obligations under this Agreement. 

\centered **NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS** 

^^Waiver of Certain Other Rights. To the extent that Executive shall have received severance payments or other severance benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement of any [[Organization 1 Name]] Party prior to receiving severance payments or other severance benefits pursuant to Article II, the severance payments or other severance benefits under such other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement shall reduce (but not below zero) the corresponding severance payments or other benefits to which Executive shall be entitled under Article II. To the extent that Executive accepts payments made pursuant to Article II, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to receive a corresponding amount of future severance payments or other severance benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or agreement of any [[Organization 1 Name]] Party. 

^^Other Rights. Except as expressly provided in Section 5.1 and as provided in the Recitals to this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent or limit Executive’s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program, policy, practice or procedure provided by a [[Organization 1 Name]] Party and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall this Agreement limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any other agreements with a [[Organization 1 Name]] Party. Amounts that are vested benefits or that Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice or procedure and any other payment or benefit required by law at or after the Termination Date shall be payable in accordance with such plan, program, policy, practice or procedure or applicable law except as expressly modified by this Agreement. 

^^No Right to Continued Employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee the right of Executive to continue in employment, and [[Organization 1 Name]] and the Employer retain the right to terminate Executive’s employment at any time for any reason or for no reason. 

\centered **CLAIMS PROCEDURE** 

^^Filing a Claim. 

^^Each individual eligible for benefits under this Agreement (“Claimant”) may submit his application for benefits (“Claim”) to [[Organization 1 Name]] (or to such other person as may be designated by [[Organization 1 Name]]) in writing in such form as is provided or approved by [[Organization 1 Name]]. A Claimant shall have no right to seek review of a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to enforce a Claim, prior to his filing a Claim and exhausting his rights to review under Sections 6.1 and 6.2. 

^^When a Claim has been filed properly, it shall be evaluated and the Claimant shall be notified of the approval or the denial of the Claim within 30 days after the receipt of such Claim. A Claimant shall be given a written notice in which the Claimant shall be advised as to whether the Claim is granted or denied, in whole or in part. If a Claim is denied, in whole or in part, the notice shall contain: (i) the specific reasons for the denial, (ii) references to pertinent provisions of this Agreement on which the denial is based, (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the Claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, (iv) the Claimant’s right to seek review of the denial and a description of the procedures for such review, and (v) a statement regarding Claimant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse decision on appeal. 

^^Review of Claim Denial. If a Claim is denied, in whole or in part, or if a Claim is neither approved nor denied within the 30-day period specified Section 6.1(b), the Claimant (or his authorized representative) shall have the right at any time to: (a) request that [[Organization 1 Name]] (or such other person as shall be designated in writing by [[Organization 1 Name]]) review the denial or the failure to approve or deny the Claim, (b) review pertinent documents, and (c) submit issues and comments in writing. Within 30 days after such a request is received, [[Organization 1 Name]] shall complete its review and give the Claimant written notice of its decision.

[[Organization 1 Name]] shall include in its notice to Claimant: (i) the specific reasons for its decision, (ii) references to provisions of this Agreement on which its decision is based, (iii) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim, and (iv) a statement regarding the Claimant’s right to bring a civil action under ERISA Section 502(a) within 180 days of receipt of notice of denial on appeal. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS** 

^^No Assignability. This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior written consent of [[Organization 1 Name]] shall not be assignable by Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive’s legal representatives. 

^^Successors. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon [[Organization 1 Name]] and its successors and assigns.

Any successor to the business or assets of [[Organization 1 Name]] (or any Employer) which assumes or agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, contract, or otherwise shall be jointly and severally liable with [[Organization 1 Name]] (or the Employer) under this Agreement as if such successor were [[Organization 1 Name]] (or the Employer). If Executive’s employment is transferred from [[Organization 1 Name]] to a Subsidiary, or from a Subsidiary to [[Organization 1 Name]] or another

If no Beneficiary is designated, Executive’s estate shall be his Beneficiary. 

^^Non-Alienation of Benefits. Benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, before actually being received by Executive, and any such attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable under this Agreement shall be void. 

^^Severability. If any one or more Articles, Sections or other portions of this Agreement are declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any Article, Section or other portion not so declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Article, Section or other portion so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall be construed so as to effectuate the terms of such Article, Section or other portion to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.
