^^**Waiver of Repayment Obligations**. In the event that an Eligible Employee incurs a Severance during the Change in Control Protection Period, any obligation that such Eligible Employee may otherwise have had to repay amounts to the Company in respect of a relocation commitment bonus, other relocation assistance or a commuter bonus shall be waived immediately upon such termination and the Eligible Employee shall not be required to repay any such amounts to the Company.

^^**Benefit Continuation**. Subject to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and Section 4 hereof, in the case of each Eligible Employee who incurs a Severance during the Change in Control Protection Period, commencing on the date immediately following such Eligible Employee's Severance Date and continuing for the period set forth below (the "Welfare Benefit Continuation Period"), the Company shall, at its sole expense, provide to each such Eligible Employee (and such person's eligible dependants) group medical and dental benefits substantially similar to the benefits provided to such Eligible Employee under the group medical and dental plans of the Company in which such Eligible Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to such employee's Severance Date or, if more favorable to such employee, immediately prior to the Change in Control, it being understood that the Eligible Employee will, during such period, be responsible for the portion of the premium paid by such Eligible Employee while active and for other charges passed along to active employees (such as co-payments). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event that an Eligible Employee commences employment with another company at any time during the Welfare Benefits Continuation Period, the Eligible Employee shall cease receiving such group medical and dental plan coverage. Within thirty (30) days of an Eligible Employee's commencement of employment with another company, such Eligible Employee shall provide the Company written notice of such employment and provide information to the Company regarding the medical and dental benefits provided to such Eligible Employee by his or her new employer. The Welfare Benefit Co ntinuation Period shall equal, for each Eligible Employee, the period of time used to calculate the severance payment described in Section 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 hereof, as applicable. The coverage period for purposes of the group health continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code (the "COBRA Continuation Period") shall commence on the date immediately following the Welfare Benefit Continuation Period.

^^**Outplacement Services**. Subject to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and Section 4 hereof, each Eligible Employee who incurs a Severance during the Change in Control Protection Period shall be provided with appropriate outplacement services as selected by the Company for a period of 1 month with respect to Tier I Employees, 6 months with respect to Tier II Employees, 3 months with respect to Tier III Employees and 1 month with respect to Tier IV Employees. Tier V Employees shall be entitled to a 2 day outplacement workshop.

^^**Legal Fees**. The Company shall reimburse each Eligible Employee whose termination of employment occurs during the Change in Control Protection Period for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by such Eligible Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided under this Plan or an Alternative Arrangement (as defined below), provided such Eligible Employee prevails in substantial part on the material issues presented in such legal or other proceeding.

^^**Release**. No Eligible Employee who incurs a Severance during the Change in Control Protection Period shall be eligible to receive any payments or other benefits under the Plan (other than payments under Section 2.2 hereof and benefits under Section 2.9 hereof) unless he or she first executes a release in favor of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and does not revoke such release within the time permitted therein for such revocation.

^^**Section 409A**. It is intended that payments and benefits under this Plan not subject Eligible Employees to taxation under Section 409A of the Code and, accordingly, this Plan shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Any payments described in this Plan that are due within the “short term deferral period” as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. If current or future regulations or guidance from the Internal Revenue Service dictates, or the Company’s counsel determines that any payments or benefits due to the Eligible Employee hereunder upon the schedule otherwise provided h erein would cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, then, to the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Eligible Employee’s Severance Date shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Eligible Employee’s Severance Date (or upon such Eligible Employee's death, if earlier). To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, amounts reimbursable to the Eligible Employee under this Plan (including any legal fee reimbursements) shall be paid to the Eligible Employee on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense or tax was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to the Eligible Employee) during any one year may not effect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.

^^**Nonduplication; Coordination with Other Arrangements**. This Plan shall not be deemed to impair any rights of an Eligible Employee pursuant to any other agreement, plan or arrangement with the Company or an Affiliate (an "Alternative Arrangement"); provided however that the compensation and benefits provided under this Plan shall be coordinated with similar compensation and benefits provided under other Company-sponsored plans and individual agreements with Eligible Employees so as to avoid the duplication of any such compensation and benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an Eligible Employee is party to an Alternative Arrangement which provides one or more of the types of benefits provided under Sections 2.3 through 2.13 of this Plan upon a termination of employment, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to the payment or benefit which is more favorable to the Eligible Employee, as determined on a per-payment or per-benefit basis, as applicable. For purposes of the foregoing comparison, an Eligible Employee who experiences a termination of employment during the Change in Control Protection Period qualifying him or her for severance payments or benefits under this Plan or the applicable Alternative Arrangement shall be deemed to have experienced a qualifying termination of employment for purposes of each of the Plan and the Alternative Arrangement.

^**PLAN ADMINISTRATION**.

^^The Plan Administrator shall administer the Plan and may interpret the Plan, prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations under the Plan and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, subject to all of the provisions of the Plan.

^^The Plan Administrator may delegate any of its duties hereunder to such person or persons from time to time as it may designate.

^^The Plan Administrator is empowered, on behalf of the Plan, to engage accountants, legal counsel and such other personnel as it deems necessary or advisable to assist it in the performance of its duties under the Plan. The functions of any such persons engaged by the Plan Administrator shall be limited to the specified services and duties for which they are engaged, and such persons shall have no other duties, obligations or responsibilities under the Plan. Such persons shall exercise no discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting the management of the Plan. All reasonable expenses thereof shall be borne by the Company.

^**EXCISE TAX**.

^^**Excise Tax Treatment**. Unless a more favorable treatment is otherwise provided in an individual agreement with an Eligible Employee, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement (collectively, a "Payment"), to or for the benefit of an Eligible Employee, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, or any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such tax or taxes, tog ether with any such interest and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the aggregate amount of Payments payable to the Eligible Employee shall be reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount, with such reduction being applied first to the cash payments under Section 2 hereof and then to other benefits provided hereunder; provided however that such reduction shall not be effected in the event that the net amount of Payments received by the Eligible Employee, after giving effect to the imposition of the Excise Tax (and all other applicable taxes) exceeds the net amount of such Payments received by the Eligible Employee after giving effect to the reduction.

^**PLAN MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION**.

The Plan may be terminated or amended by the Board at any time; provided, however, that during the Change in Control Protection Period, (a) the Plan may not be terminated and (b) the Plan may not be amended if such amendment would in any manner be adverse to the interests of any Eligible Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) any action taken by the Company or the Plan Administrator to cause an Eligible Employee to no longer be designated as a Tier I Employee, Tier II Employee, Tier III Employee or Tier IV Employee, as the case may be, or to decrease the benefits for which an Eligible Employee is eligible, and (b) any amendment to this Section 5 following the occurrence of a Change in Control shall be treated as an amendment to the Plan which is adverse to the interests of any Eligible Employee.

^**GENERAL PROVISIONS**.

^^Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, no right or interest of any Eligible Employee under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation by execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge or in any manner; no attempted assignment or transfer thereof shall be effective; and no right or interest of any Eligible Employee under the Plan shall be liable for, or subject to, any obligation or liability of such Eligible Employee.

^^If the Company or any subsidiary thereof is obligated by law or by contract to pay severance pay, a termination indemnity, notice pay, or the like, or if the Company or any subsidiary thereof is obligated by law to provide advance notice of separation ("Notice Period"), then any severance pay hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any such severance pay, termination indemnity, notice pay or the like, as applicable, and by the amount of any compensation received during any Notice Period.

^^Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund, trust or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving any Eligible Employee, or any person whomsoever, the right to be retained in the service of the Company or any subsidiary thereof, and all Eligible Employees shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan had never been adopted.

^^If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions had not been included.

^^The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of the Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan.

^^This Plan shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent not preempted by federal law, which shall otherwise control.

^^All benefits hereunder shall be reduced by applicable withholding and shall be subject to applicable tax reporting, as determined by the Plan Administrator.

^^The Plan, as a "severance pay arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(2)(B)(i) of ERISA, is intended to be excepted from the definitions of "employee pension benefit plan" and "pension plan" set forth under section 3(2) of ERISA, and is intended to meet the descriptive requirements of a plan constituting a "severance pay plan" within the meaning of regulations published by the Secretary of Labor at Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations §2510.3-2(b).
