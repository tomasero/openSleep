^**Exercise of Warrant**. 

^^**Exercise for Cash**. At any time and from time to time on and after one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of effectiveness or commencement of sales of the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”) and expiring on , at 11:59 p.m., Richmond, Virginia time (the “Exercise Period”), the Warrant may be exercised as to all or any portion of the whole number of shares covered by the Warrant by the holder thereof by surrender of the Warrant, accompanied by a subscription for shares to be purchased in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and by a check payable to the order of the Company in the amount required for purchase of the shares as to which the Warrant is being exercised, delivered to the Company at its principal office at Suite F, 23rd Floor, Building B, Jiangjing Mansion, 228 Yanjiang Ave., Jiangan District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China 430010, Attention: [[Person 1 First Name]] [[Person 1 Last Name]], Chief Executive Officer. 

^^**Cashless Exercise**. In addition, during the Exercise Period and to the extent that the Company has failed to register the shares issuable hereunder in accordance with Section 7 hereof within 90 days of the notification of the Company of the exercise of such demand registration right, the Warrant may be exercised as to all or any portion of the whole number of shares covered by the Warrant by the holder thereof by surrender of Warrant together with irrevocable instructions to the Company to issue in exchange for the Warrant the number of shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares as to which the Warrant is being exercised multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the Current Value of any share less the Exercise Price therefor and the denominator of which is such Current Value. In the case of the purchase of less than all the shares purchasable under the Warrant, the Company shall cancel such Warrant and shall execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor for the unexercised balance. For the purposes hereof, “Exercise Date” shall mean the date on which all deliveries required to be made to the Company upon exercise of the Warrant pursuant to this Section 4 shall have been made. 

^^**Issuance of Certificates**. Upon the exercise of a Warrant in whole or in part, the Company will within five (5) days thereafter, at its expense (including the payment by the Company of any applicable issue or transfer taxes), cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Warrant holder a certificate or certificates for the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares to which such holder is entitled upon exercise of the Warrant. In the event such holder is entitled to a fractional share, in lieu thereof such holder shall be paid a cash amount equal to such fraction, multiplied by the Current Value of one full share on the date of exercise. Certificates for shares issuable by reason of the exercise of the Warrant shall be dated and shall be effective as of the date of the surrendering of the Warrant for exercise, notwithstanding any delays in the actual execution, issuance or delivery of the certificates for the shares so purchased. In the event the Warrant is exercised as to less than the aggregate amount of all shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant held by such person, the Company shall issue a new Warrant to the holder of the Warrant so exercised covering the aggregate number of shares as to which the Warrant remains unexercised. In addition to the foregoing, should the Company fail to issue the share certificate or certificates within the time limits referenced in the first sentence of this Section 4(c), if and to the extent not already utilized as to the Warrant or the shares underlying the Warrant, the holder may utilize the cashless exercise contained in Section 4(b) hereof. 

^^**Current Value**. For purposes of this section, “Current Value” is defined (i) in the case for which a public market exists for the shares at the time of such exercise, at a price per share equal to (A) the average of the means between the closing bid and asked prices of the shares in the over-the-counter market for 20 consecutive business days commencing 30 business days before the date of such notice, (B) if the shares are quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, at the average of the means of the daily closing bid and asked prices of the shares for 20 consecutive business days commencing 30 business days before the date of such notice, or (C) if the shares are listed on any national securities exchange or The NASDAQ National Market, at the average of the daily closing prices of the shares for 20 consecutive business days commencing 30 business days before the date of such notice, and (ii) in the case no public market exists at the time of such exercise, at the Appraised Value. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Appraised Value” is the value determined in accordance with the following procedures. For a period of five (5) days after the date of an event (a “Valuation Event”) requiring determination of Current Value at a time when no public market exists for the shares (the “Negotiation Period”), each party to this Agreement agrees to negotiate in good faith to reach agreement upon the Appraised Value of the securities or property at issue, as of the date of the Valuation Event, which will be the fair market value of such securities or property, without premium for control or discount for minority interests, illiquidity or restrictions on transfer. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon the Appraised Value of such securities or other property by the end of the Negotiation Period, then the Appraised Value of such securities or property will be determined for purposes of this Agreement by a recognized appraisal or investment banking firm mutually agreeable to the holder(s) of the Warrant and the Company (the “Appraiser”). If the holder(s) of the Warrant and the Company cannot agree on an Appraiser within two (2) business days after the end of the Negotiation Period, the Company, on the one hand, and the holder(s) of the Warrant, on the other hand, will each select an Appraiser within ten (10) business days after the end of the Negotiation Period and those Appraisers will determine the fair market value of such securities or property, without premium for control or discount for minority interests. Such independent Appraiser(s) will be directed to determine fair market value of such securities or property as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of its selection. The determination by Appraiser(s) of the fair market value will be conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement. If there are two Appraisers, and they do not agree as to fair market value, then fair market value shall be determined to be the average of the fair market values as determined by each Appraiser. Appraised Value of each share at a time when (i) the Company is not a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and (ii) the shares are not traded in the organized securities markets, will, in all cases, be calculated by determining the Appraised Value of the entire Company taken as a whole and dividing that value by the number of shares then outstanding, without premium for control or discount for minority interests, illiquidity or restrictions on transfer. The costs of the Appraiser(s) will be borne by the Company. In no event will the Appraised Value of the shares be less than the per share consideration received or receivable with respect to the shares or securities or property of the same class in connection with a pending transaction involving a sale, merger, recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, or share exchange, dissolution of the Company, sale or transfer of all or a majority of its assets or revenue or income generating capacity, or similar transaction. 

^**Protection Against Dilution**. The Exercise Price for the shares and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant, in whole or in part, is subject to adjustment from time to time as described in this Section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Warrant Agreement is intended or may be construed to violate any FINRA Conduct Rule. In particular, the anti-dilution provisions of this Warrant Agreement shall be interpreted in compliance with Rule 5110(f)(2)(H)(vi) and (vii) of the FINRA Conduct Rules. 

^^**Dividends, Subdivisions, Reclassifications, Etc**. In case at any time or from time to time after the date of execution of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) take a record of the holders of shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or a distribution on shares payable in shares or another class of securities, (ii) subdivide or reclassify its outstanding share of shares into a greater number shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify its outstanding shares into a smaller number of shares, then, and in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted in such a manner that the Exercise Price for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately after such event shall bear the same ratio to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to any such event as the total number of shares outstanding immediately prior to such event shall bear to the total number of shares outstanding immediately after such event. 

^^**Adjustment of Number of Shares Purchasable**. When any adjustment is required to be made in the Exercise Price under this Section 5, (i) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant, in whole or in part, shall be changed (upward to the nearest full share) to the number of shares determined by dividing (x) an amount equal to the number of shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to the adjustment, multiplied by the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the adjustment, by (y) the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment, and (ii) upon exercise of the Warrant, the holder will be entitled to receive the number of shares of other securities referred to in Section 5(a) that such holder would have received had the Warrant been exercised prior to the events referred to in Section 5(a). 

^^**Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, Etc**. In the case of any reorganization or consolidation of the Company with, or any merger of the Company with or into, another entity (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation) or in case of any sale or transfer to another entity of the majority of assets of the Company, the entity resulting from such reorganization or consolidation or surviving such merger or to which such sale or transfer shall be made, as the case may be, shall make suitable provision (which shall be fair and equitable to each holder of a Warrant) and shall assume the obligations of the Company hereunder (by written instrument executed and mailed to each holder of a Warrant then outstanding) pursuant to which, upon exercise of the Warrant, at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation, merger or conveyance, the holder shall be entitled to receive the common shares or other securities or property that such holder would have been entitled to upon consummation if such holder had exercised the Warrant immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided in this Section 5. 

^^**Certificate as to Adjustments**. In the event of adjustment as herein provided in the paragraphs of this Section 5, the Company shall promptly mail to each Warrant holder a certificate setting forth the Exercise Price and number of shares issuable upon exercise after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of facts requiring such adjustment. Such certificate shall also set forth the kind and amount of shares or other securities or property into which the Warrant shall be exercisable after any adjustment of the Exercise Price as provided in this Agreement. 

^^**Minimum Adjustment**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no certificate as to adjustment of the Exercise Price hereunder shall be made if such adjustment results in a change in the Exercise Price then in effect of less than five cents ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) and any adjustment of less than five cents ($[[USD Value 2]]) of any Exercise Price shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment that, together with the adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, amounts to five cents ($[[USD Value 2]]) or more; provided however, that upon the exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall have made all necessary adjustments (to the nearest cent) not theretofore made to the Exercise Price up to and including the date upon which such Warrant is exercised.
