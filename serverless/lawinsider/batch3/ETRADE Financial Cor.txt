^^**Option** **or SAR Repricing**. Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, or exchange of shares), the Company shall not amend the terms of outstanding awards to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or SARs or cancel outstanding Options or SARS in exchange for cash, other awards or Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or SARs without stockholder approval This paragraph shall not be construed to apply to “issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applies,” within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code.

^S**HARES** S**UBJECT TO** P**LAN**.  
^^**Maximum Number of Shares Issuable**. Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the number of shares of Stock available for grant under the Predecessor Plan as of the Effective Date or (b) [[Shares 1: Number]] shares, plus 30 million shares added effective [[Date 3: Date]], plus 125 million shares added effective [[Date 1]], and shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof.

^^**Share Accoun****ting**. If an outstanding Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company for an amount not greater than the Participant’s original purchase price, the shares of Stock allocable to the terminated portion of such Award or such forfeited or repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. Shares of Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the Plan with respect to any portion of an Award, other than an Option or SAR, that is settled in cash. Shares withheld or reacquired by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 17.2 shall not again be available for issuance under the Plan. Upon payment in shares of Stock pursuant to the exercise of an SAR, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the SAR is exercised. If the exercise price of an Option is paid by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant, or by means of a Net-Exercise, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the Option is exercised.

^^**Adjustment for Unissued or Forfeited Predecessor Plan Shares**. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 4.1 shall be cumulatively increased from time to time by:

^^the number of shares of Stock subject to that portion of any award outstanding pursuant to the Predecessor Plan as of the Effective Date which, on or after such date, expires or is terminated or canceled for any reason without having been exercised or settled; and

^^the number of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Predecessor Plan subject to forfeiture or repurchase by the Company which, on or after the Effective Date, are so forfeited or repurchased for an amount not greater than the Participant’s original purchase price;

provided, however, that the aggregate number of shares of Stock authorized for issuance under the Predecessor Plans that may become authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall not exceed thirty-nine million ([[Shares 3: Number]]), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4.

^^**Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure**. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and kind of shares subject to the Plan and to any outstanding Awards, in the maximum adjustment for unissued or forfeited Predecessor Plan shares set forth in Section 4.3, in the Award limits set forth in Section 5.3 and in the exercise or purchase price per share under any outstanding Award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants’ rights under the Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as “effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.” If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Awards are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event) shares of another corporation (the “***New Shares*** ”), the Committee may unilaterally amend the outstanding Awards to provide that such Awards are for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise or purchase price per share of, the outstanding Awards shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Committee, in its discretion. Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the exercise or purchase price under any Award be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to such Award. The Committee in its sole discretion, may also make such adjustments in the terms of any Award to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate, including modification of Performance Goals, Performance Award Formulas and Performance Periods. The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be final, binding and conclusive.

The Committee may, without affecting the number of Shares reserved or available hereunder, authorize the issuance or assumption of benefits under this Plan in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, subject to compliance with Sections 409A and 422 and any related guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, where applicable.

^E**LIGIBILITY**, P****ARTICIPATION AND** A**WARD** LIMITATIONS**.

^^**Persons Eligible for A****wards**. Awards may be granted only to Employees, Consultants and Directors. A Nonemployee Director Award may be granted only to a person who, at the time of grant, is a Nonemployee Director.

^^**Participation in Plan**. Awards are granted solely at the discretion of the Committee. Eligible persons may be granted more than one Award. However, eligibility in accordance with this Section shall not entitle any person to be granted an Award, or, having been granted an Award, to be granted an additional Award.

^^**Award Limitations**.   
^^***Incentive Stock Option Limitations***.

^^^**Maximum Number of Shares Issuable Pursuant to** **Incentive Stock Options**. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, the maximumaggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed forty two million (42,000,000) shares, plus any shares added to the aggregate number of shares under the Plan pursuant to Section 4.1 as a result of stockholder approval following the Effective Date. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to all Awards other than Incentive Stock Options shall be the number of shares determined in accordance with Section 4.1, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, 4.3 and Section 4.4.

^^^**Persons Eligible**. An Incentive Stock Option may be granted only to a person who, on the effective date of grant, is an Employee of the Company, a Parent Corporation or a Subsidiary Corporation (each being an “***[[Organization 2 Name]]***”). Any person who is not an Employee of an [[Organization 2 Name]] on the effective date of the grant of an Option to such person may be granted only a Nonstatutory Stock Option. An Incentive Stock Option granted to a prospective Employee upon the condition that such person become an Employee of an [[Organization 2 Name]] shall be deemed granted effective on the date such person commences Service with an [[Organization 2 Name]], with an exercise price determined as of such date in accordance with Section 8.2.

^^^**Fair Market Value Limitation**. To the extent that options designated as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock option plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a limitation different from that set forth in this Section, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code. If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising. In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first. Upon exercise, shares issued pursuant to each such portion shall be separately identified.

^^***Limit on Full Value Aw******ards without Minimum Vesting***. Except with respect to a maximum of five percent ([[Percentage 4: Number]]%) of the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan, as provided in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, any Full Value Award which vests on the basis of the Participant’s continued Service shall not provide for vesting which is any more rapid than over a period of three (3) years, and any Full Value Award which vests on the basis of the attainment of performance goals shall not provide for a performance period of less than twelve (12) months; provided, however, that such limitations shall not preclude the acceleration of vesting of any such Award upon the death, disability, retirement or involuntary termination of Service of the Participant or upon or following a Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its discretion.

^^Section ***162(m) Award Limits***. The following limits shall apply to the grant of any Award if, at the time of grant, the Company is a “publicly held corporation” within the meaning of Section 162(m).

^^^**Options and SARs**. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, no Employee shall be granted within any fiscal year of the Company one or more Options or Freestanding SARs which in the aggregate are for more than two million five hundred thousand (2,500,000) shares.

^^^**Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards**. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, no Employee shall be granted within any fiscal year of the Company one or more Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Unit Awards, the grant or vesting of which is based on the attainment of Performance Goals, for more than one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) shares.

^^^**Performance Awards**. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, no Employee shall be granted (1) Performance Shares which could result in such Employee receiving more than one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) shares for each full fiscal year of the Company contained in the Performance Period for such Award, or (2) Performance Units which could result in such Employee receiving more than five million ($[[USD Value 2: Number]]) for each full fiscal year of the Company contained in the Performance Period for such Award. No Participant may be granted more than one Performance Award for the same Performance Period.

^^^**Cash-Based Awards** **and Other Stock-Based Awards**. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, no Employee shall be granted (1) Cash-Based Awards in any fiscal year of the Company, the grant or vesting of which is based on the attainment of Performance Goals, which could result in such Employee receiving more than five million ($[[USD Value 2]]), or (2) Other Stock-Based Awards in any fiscal year of the Company, the grant or vesting of which is based on the attainment of Performance Goals, which could result in such Employee receiving more than one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) shares.

^S**TOCK** O**PTIONS**.  
Options shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No Option or purported Option shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing Options may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A if applicable, and, except as otherwise set forth in Section 12 with respect to Nonemployee Director Options, shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

^^**Exercise Price**. The exercise price for each Option shall be established in the discretion of the Committee; provided, however, that (a) the exercise price per share shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option and (b) no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner shall have an exercise price per share less than one hundred ten percent ([[Percentage 5: Number]]%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option (whether an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option) may be granted with an exercise price lower than the minimum exercise price set forth above if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner qualifying under the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code.

^^**Exercisability and Term of Options**. Options shall be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option; provided, however, that (a) no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such Option and (b) no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner shall be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years after the effective date of grant of such Option. Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the grant of an Option, each Option granted hereunder shall terminate ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions.

^^**Payment of Exercise Price**.  
^^***Forms of Consideration Authorized***. Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Option shall be made (i) in cash or by check or cash equivalent, (ii) by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value not less than the exercise price, (iii) by delivery of a properly executed notice of exercise together with irrevocable instructions to a broker providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares being acquired upon the exercise of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (a “***Cashless Exercise***”), (iv) by delivery of a properly executed notice electing a Net-Exercise, (v) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Committee from time to time to the extent permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Committee shall not permit payment by means of a Participant’s promissory note, or (vi) by any combination thereof. The Committee may at any time or from time to time grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of consideration.

^^***Limitations on Forms of Consideration***.

^^^**Tender of Stock.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company’s stock. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Participant for more than six (6) months (or such other period, if any, as the Committee may permit) and not used for another Option exercise by attestation during such period, or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.

^^^**Cas****hless Exercise**. The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, to establish, decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise, including with respect to one or more Participants specified by the Company notwithstanding that such program or procedures may be available to other Participants.

^^**Effect of Termination of Service**.  
^^**Option Exercisability**. Subject to earlier termination of the Option as otherwise provided herein and unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of an Option and set forth in the Award Agreement, an Option shall terminate immediately upon the Participant’s termination of Service to the extent that it is then unvested and shall be exercisable after the Participant’s termination of Service to the extent it is then vested only during the applicable time period determined in accordance with this Section and thereafter shall terminate:

^^^**Disability**. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the Disability of the Participant, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the Option’s term as set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option (the “***Option Expiration Date***”).

^^^**Death**. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the death of the Participant, any unexercisable or unvested portion of the Option shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated and may be exercised by the Participant’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the Participant’s death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. The Participant’s Service shall be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Participant dies within three (3) months after the Participant’s termination of Service.

^^^**Termination for Cause**. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant’s Service is terminated for Cause or if, following the Participant’s termination of Service and during any period in which the Option otherwise would remain exercisable, the Participant engages in any act that would constitute Cause for termination of Service, the Option shall terminate in its entirety and cease to be exercisable immediately upon such termination of Service or act.

^^^**Other Termination of Service**. If the Participant’s Service terminates for any reason, except Disability, death or Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Participant on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant (1) at any time prior to the expiration of six (6) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated if the Participant remains subject to the Insider Trading Policy for a period of at least sixty (60) days following the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated or (2) at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated in the case of any other Participant, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

^^***Extension if*** ***Exercise Prevented by Law***. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than termination for Cause, if the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.4(a) is prevented by the provisions of Section 16 below, the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months (or such longer period of time as determined by the Committee, in its discretion) after the date the Participant is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

^^***Extension if Participant Subject to*** Section ***16(b)***. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than termination for Cause, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.4(a) of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option would subject the Participant to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option shall remain exercisable until the earliest to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which a sale of such shares by the Participant would no longer be subject to such suit, (ii) the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the Participant’s termination of Service, or (iii) the Option Expiration Date.

^^**Transferability of Options**. During the lifetime of the Participant, an Option shall be exercisable only by the Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative. An Option shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be assignable or transferable to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option.

^S**TOCK** A**PPRECIATION** R**IGHTS**.  
Stock Appreciation Rights shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock subject to the Award, in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No SAR or purported SAR shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing SARs may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A if applicable, and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

^^**Types of SARs Authorized**. SARs may be granted in tandem with all or any portion of a related Option (a “***Tandem SAR***”) or may be granted independently of any Option (a “***Freestanding SAR***”). A Tandem SAR may only be granted concurrently with the grant of the related Option.

^^**Exercise Price**. The exercise price for each SAR shall be established in the discretion of the Committee; provided, however, that (a) the exercise price per share subject to a Tandem SAR shall be the exercise price per share under the related Option and (b) the exercise price per share subject to a Freestanding SAR shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the SAR.

^^**Exercisability and Term of SARs**.  
^^***Tandem SARs***. Tandem SARs shall be exercisable only at the time and to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related Option is exercisable, subject to such provisions as the Committee may specify where the Tandem SAR is granted with respect to less than the full number of shares of Stock subject to the related Option. The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Tandem SAR that such SAR may not be exercised without the advance approval of the Company and, if such approval is not given, then the Option shall nevertheless remain exercisable in accordance with its terms. A Tandem SAR shall terminate and cease to be exercisable no later than the date on which the related Option expires or is terminated or canceled. Upon the exercise of a Tandem SAR with respect to some or all of the shares subject to such SAR, the related Option shall be canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the Tandem SAR was exercised. Upon the exercise of an Option related to a Tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares subject to such Option, the related Tandem SAR shall be canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the related Option was exercised.

^^***Freestanding SARs***. Freestanding SARs shall be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR; provided, however, that no Freestanding SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such SAR.

^^**Exercise of SARs**. Upon the exercise (or deemed exercise pursuant to Section 7.5) of an SAR, the Participant (or the Participant’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the SAR by reason of the Participant’s death) shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount for each share with respect to which the SAR is exercised equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR over the exercise price. Payment of such amount shall be made (a) in the case of a Tandem SAR, solely in shares of Stock in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date of exercise of the SAR and (b) in the case of a Freestanding SAR, in cash, shares of Stock, or any combination thereof as determined by the Committee in compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement evidencing a Freestanding SAR, payment shall be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date of exercise of the SAR. The Award Agreement evidencing any Freestanding SAR may provide for deferred payment in a lump sum or in installments in compliance with Section 409A. When payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of shares to be issued shall be determined on the basis of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR. For purposes of Section 7, an SAR shall be deemed exercised on the date on which the Company receives notice of exercise from the Participant or as otherwise provided in Section 7.5.

^^**Deemed Exercise of SARs**. If, on the date on which an SAR would otherwise terminate or expire, the SAR by its terms remains exercisable immediately prior to such termination or expiration and, if so exercised, would result in a payment to the holder of such SAR, then any portion of such SAR which has not previously been exercised shall automatically be deemed to be exercised as of such date with respect to such portion.

^^**Effect of Termination of Service**. Subject to earlier termination of the SAR as otherwise provided herein and unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of an SAR and set forth in the Award Agreement, an SAR shall be exercisable after a Participant’s termination of Service only to the extent and during the applicable time period determined in accordance with Section 6.4 (treating the SAR as if it were an Option) and thereafter shall terminate.

^^**Nontransferability of SARs**. During the lifetime of the Participant, an SAR shall be exercisable only by the Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative. An SAR shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Tandem SAR related to a Nonstatutory Stock Option or a Freestanding SAR shall be assignable or transferable to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.

^S**TOCK** A**WARDS**.  
Stock Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying whether the Award is a Stock Bonus or a Stock Purchase Right and the number of shares of Stock subject to the Award, in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No Stock Award or purported Stock Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing Stock Awards may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, if applicable, and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

^^**Types of Stock Awards Authorized**. Stock Awards may be granted in the form of either a Stock Bonus or a Stock Purchase Right. Stock Awards may be granted upon such conditions as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals described in Section 10.4. If either the grant of a Stock Award or the lapsing of the Restriction Period is to be contingent upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, the Committee shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3 through 10.5(a).

^^**Purchase Price**. The purchase price for shares of Stock issuable under each Stock Purchase Right shall be established by the Committee in its discretion. No monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding) shall be required as a condition of receiving shares of Stock pursuant to a Stock Bonus, the consideration for which shall be services actually rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, the Participant shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit having a value not less than the par value of the shares of Stock subject to a Stock Award.

^^**Purchase Period**. A Stock Purchase Right shall be exercisable within a period established by the Committee, which shall in no event exceed thirty (30) days from the effective date of the grant of the Stock Purchase Right.

^^**Payment of Purchase Price**. Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the purchase price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Stock Purchase Right shall be made (i) in cash or by check or cash equivalent, (ii) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Committee from time to time to the extent permitted by applicable law, or (iii) by any combination thereof. The Committee may at any time or from time to time grant Stock Purchase Rights which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the purchase price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of consideration.

^^**Vesting and Restrictions on Transfer**. Subject to Section 5.3(b), Shares issued pursuant to any Stock Award may (but need not) be made subject to Vesting Conditions based upon the satisfaction of such Service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as shall be established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. During any Restriction Period in which shares acquired pursuant to a Stock Award remain subject to Vesting Conditions, such shares may not be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of other than pursuant to an Ownership Change Event or as provided in Section 8.8. The Committee, in its discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Stock Award that, if the satisfaction of Vesting Conditions with respect to any shares subject to such Stock Award would otherwise occur on a day on which the sale of such shares would violate the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, then the satisfaction of the Vesting Conditions automatically be deemed to occur on the next day on which the sale of such shares would not violate the Insider Trading Policy. Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.

^^**Voting Rights; Dividends and Distributions**. Except as provided in this Section, Section 8.5 and any Award Agreement; during any Restriction Period applicable to shares subject to a Stock Award, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company holding shares of Stock, including the right to vote such shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares. However, in the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant is entitled by reason of the Participant’s Stock Award shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as the shares subject to the Stock Award with respect to which such dividends or distributions were paid or adjustments were made.

^^**Effect of Termination of Service**. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement evidencing a Stock Award, if a Participant’s Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant’s death or disability), then (a) the Company shall have the option to repurchase for the purchase price paid by the Participant any shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to a Stock Purchase Right which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant’s termination of Service and (b) the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to a Stock Bonus which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant’s termination of Service. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.

^^**Nontransferability of Stock Award Rights**. Rights to acquire shares of Stock pursuant to a Stock Award shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to a Stock Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative.

^R**ESTRICTED** S**TOCK** U**NIT** A**WARDS**.  
Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award, in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No Restricted Stock Unit Award or purported Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing Restricted Stock Units may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of

^with respect to Section 409A, if applicable, and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

^^**Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards**. Restricted Stock Unit Awards may be granted upon such conditions as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals described in Section 10.4. If either the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award or the Vesting Conditions with respect to such Award is to be contingent upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, the

Committee shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3 through 10.5(a).

^^**Purchase Price**. No monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) shall be required as a condition of receiving a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the consideration for which shall be services actually rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, the Participant shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit having a value not less than the par value of the shares of Stock issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Unit Award.

^^**Vesting**. Subject to Section 5.3(b), Restricted Stock Unit Awards may (but need not) be made subject to Vesting Conditions based upon the satisfaction of such Service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as shall be established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award.

^^**Voting Rights, Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions**. Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Restricted Stock Units until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Restricted Stock Unit Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date such Award is granted and ending, with respect to the particular shares subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date the Award is settled or the date on which it is terminated. Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole Restricted Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock. The number of additional Restricted Stock Units (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date. Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time (or as soon thereafter as practicable) as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant’s Restricted Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as are applicable to the Award.

^^**Effect of Termination of Service**. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Unit Award, if a Participant’s Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant’s death or disability), then the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any Restricted

Stock Units pursuant to the Award which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant’s termination of Service.

^^**Settlement of Restricted** **Stock Unit Awards**. The Company shall issue to a Participant on the date on which Restricted Stock Units subject to the Participant’s Restricted Stock Unit Award vest or on such other date determined by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement one (1) share of Stock (and/or any other new, substituted or additional securities or other property pursuant to an adjustment described in Section 9.4) for each Restricted Stock Unit then becoming vested or otherwise to be settled on such date, subject to the withholding of applicable taxes. If permitted by the Committee, subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, the Participant may elect in accordance with terms specified in the Award Agreement to defer receipt of all or any portion of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section, and such deferred issuance date(s) elected by the Participant shall be set forth in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide for settlement of any Restricted Stock Unit Award by payment to the Participant in cash of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on the payment date of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section. The Committee, in its discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Unit Award that, if the settlement of the Award with respect to any shares would otherwise occur on a day on which the sale of such shares would violate the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, then the settlement with respect to such shares shall occur on the next day on which the sale of such shares would not violate the Insider Trading Policy.

^^**Nontran****sferability of Restricted Stock Unit Awards**. The right to receive shares pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to a Restricted Stock Unit Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative.

^P**ERFORMANCE** A**WARDS**.  
Performance Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No Performance Award or purported Performance Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing Performance Awards may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, if applicable, and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

^^**Types of Performance Awards Authorized**. Performance Awards may be granted in the form of either Performance Shares or Performance Units. Each Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award shall specify the number of Performance Shares or Performance Units subject thereto, the Performance Award Formula, the Performance Goal(s) and Performance Period applicable to the Award, and the other terms, conditions and restrictions of the Award.

^^**Initial Value of Performance Shares and Performance Units**. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in granting a Performance Award, each Performance Share shall have an initial monetary value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, on the effective date of grant of the Performance Share, and each Performance Unit shall have an initial monetary value established by the Committee at the time of grant. The final value payable to the Participant in settlement of a Performance Award determined on the basis of the applicable Performance Award Formula will depend on the extent to which Performance Goals established by the Committee are attained within the applicable Performance Period established by the Committee.

^^**Establishment of Performance Period, Performance Goals and** **Performance Award Formula**. In granting each Performance Award, the Committee shallestablish in writing the applicable Performance Period, Performance Award Formula and one or more Performance Goals which, when measured at the end of the Performance Period, shall determine on the basis of the Performance Award Formula the final value of the Performance Award to be paid to the Participant. Unless otherwise permitted in compliance with the requirements under Section 162(m) with respect to each Performance Award intended to result in the payment of Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee shall establish the Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula applicable to each Performance Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date ninety (90) days after the commencement of the applicable Performance Period or (b) the date on which [[Percentage 2]]% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and, in any event, at a time when the outcome of the Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Once established, the Performance Goals and Performance Award Formula applicable to a Covered Employee shall not be changed during the Performance Period. The Company shall notify each Participant granted a Performance Award of the terms of such Award, including the Performance Period, Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula.

^^**Measurement of Performance Goals**. Performance Goals shall be established by the Committee on the basis of targets to be attained (“***Perfor****mance Targets***”) with respect to one or more measures of business or financial performance (each, a “*Performance Measure***”), subject to the following:

^^***Performance Measures***. Performance Measures shall have the same meanings as used in the Company’s financial statements, or, if such terms are not used in the Company’s financial statements, they shall have the meaning applied pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, or as used generally in the Company’s industry. Performance Measures shall be calculated with respect to the Company and each Subsidiary Corporation consolidated therewith for financial reporting purposes or such division or other business unit as may be selected by the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, the Performance Measures applicable to a Performance Award shall be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but prior to the accrual or payment of any Performance Award for the same Performance Period and excluding the effect (whether positive or negative) of any change in accounting standards or any extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring item, as determined by the Committee, occurring after the establishment of the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Award. Each such adjustment, if any, shall be made solely for the purpose of providing a consistent basis from period to period for the calculation of Performance Measures in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights with respect to a

Performance Award. Performance Measures may be one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee:

^^^revenue;

^^^sales;

^^^expenses;

^^^operating income;

^^^gross margin;

^^^operating margin;

^^^earnings before any one or more of: stock-based compensation expense, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization;

^^^pre-tax profit;

^^^net operating income;

^^^net income;

^^^economic value added;

^^^free cash flow;

^^^operating cash flow;

^^^stock price;

^^^earnings per share;

^^^return on stockholder equity;

^^^return on capital;

^^^return on assets;

^^^return on investment;

^^^employee satisfaction;

^^^employee retention;

^^^balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;

^^^market share;

^^^daily average revenue trades;

^^^asset gathering metrics;

^^^number of customers;

^^^customer satisfaction;

^^^product development;

^^^completion of a joint venture or other corporate transaction;

^^^completion of identified special project; and

^^^overall effectiveness of management.

^^***Performance Targets***. Performance Targets may include a minimum, maximum, target level and intermediate levels of performance, with the final value of a Performance Award determined under the applicable Performance Award Formula by the level attained during the applicable Performance Period. A Performance Target may be stated as an absolute value or as a value determined relative to an index, budget or other standard selected by the Committee.

^^**Settlement of** **Performance Awards**.  
^^***Determination of Final Value***. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Performance Period applicable to a Performance Award, the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained and the resulting final value of the Award earned by the Participant and to be paid upon its settlement in accordance with the applicable Performance Award Formula.

^^***Discretionary Adjustment of Award Formula***. In its discretion, the Committee may, either at the time it grants a Performance Award or at any time thereafter, provide for the positive or negative adjustment of the Performance Award Formula applicable to a Performance Award granted to any Participant who is not a Covered Employee to reflect such Participant’s individual performance in his or her position with the Company or such other factors as the Committee may determine. If permitted under a Covered Employee’s Award Agreement, the Committee shall have the discretion, on the basis of such criteria as may be established by the Committee, to reduce some or all of the value of the Performance Award that would otherwise be paid to the Covered Employee upon its settlement notwithstanding the attainment of any Performance Goal and the resulting value of the Performance Award determined in accordance with the Performance Award Formula. No such reduction may result in an increase in the amount payable upon settlement of another Participant’s Performance Award that is intended to result in Performance-Based Compensation.

^^***Effect of*** ***Leaves of Absence*****.** Unless otherwise required by law or a Participant’s Award Agreement, payment of the final value, if any, of a Performance Award held by a Participant who has taken in excess of thirty (30) days in leaves of absence during a Performance Period shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days of the Participant’s

Service during the Performance Period during which the Participant was not on a leave of absence.

^^***Notice to Participan******ts***. As soon as practicable following the Committee’s determination and certification in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and (b), the Company shall notify each Participant of the determination of the Committee.

^^***Payment in Settlement of Performance Awards***. Subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, as soon as practicable following the Committee’s determination and certification in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and (b), payment shall be made to each eligible Participant (or such Participant’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to receive such payment by reason of the Participant’s death) of the final value of the Participant’s Performance Award. Payment of such amount shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award, payment shall be made in a lump sum. If permitted by the Committee, and subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, the Participant may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of the payment to be made to Participant pursuant to this Section, and such deferred payment date(s) elected by the Participant shall be set forth in the Award Agreement. If any payment is to be made on a deferred basis, the Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, provide for the payment during the deferral period of Dividend Equivalents or interest.

^^***Provisions A******pplicable to Payment in Shares***. If payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of such shares shall be determined by dividing the final value of the Performance Award by the value of a share of Stock determined by the method specified in the Award Agreement. Such methods may include, without limitation, the closing market price on a specified date (such as the settlement date) or an average of market prices over a series of trading days. Shares of Stock issued in payment of any Performance Award may be fully vested and freely transferable shares or may be shares of Stock subject to Vesting Conditions as provided in Section 8.5. Any shares subject to Vesting Conditions shall be evidenced by an appropriate Award Agreement and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 8.5 through 8.8 above.

^^**Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions**. Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Performance Share Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares, if any (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Performance Share Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date the Award is granted and ending, with respect to the particular shares subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date on which the Performance Shares are settled or the date on which they are forfeited. Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be credited to the Participant in the form of additional whole Performance Shares as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock. The number of additional Performance Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on the dividend payment date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Performance Shares previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair

Market Value per share of Stock on such date. Dividend Equivalents may be paid currently or may be accumulated and paid to the extent that Performance Shares become nonforfeitable, as determined by the Committee. Settlement of Dividend Equivalents may be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the related Performance Share as provided in Section 10.5. Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid with respect to Performance Units. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant’s Performance Share Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Performance Share Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Performance Goals as are applicable to the Award.

^^**Effect of Termination of Service**. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award, the effect of a Participant’s termination of Service on the Performance Award shall be as follows:

^^***Death or Disability***. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant’s Performance Award shall be determined by the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and shall be prorated based on the number of days of the Participant’s Service during the Performance Period. Payment shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 10.5.

^^***Other Termination of Service***. If the Participant’s Service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award shall be forfeited in its entirety.

^^**Nontransferability of Performance Awards**. Prior to settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, no Performance Award shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to a Performance Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative.

^D**EFERRED** C**OMPENSATION** A**WARDS**.  
^^**Establishment of Deferred Compensation Award Programs**. This Section 11 shall not be effective unless and until the Committee determines to establish a program pursuant to this Section. The Committee, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, may establish one or more programs pursuant to the Plan under which:

^^***Elective Cash Compensation Reduction Awards***. Participants designated by the Committee who are Insiders or otherwise among a select group of highly compensated Employees may irrevocably elect, prior to a date specified by the Committee and complying with Section 409A, to reduce such Participant’s compensation otherwise payable in cash (subject to any minimum or maximum reductions imposed by the Committee) and to be granted automatically at such time or times as specified by the Committee one or more Stock Bonus Awards or Awards of Stock Units with respect to such numbers of shares of Stock as determined in accordance with the rules of the program established by the Committee and having such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee.

^^***Stock Issuance Deferral Awards***. Participants designated by the Committee who are Insiders or otherwise among a select group of highly compensated Employees may irrevocably elect, prior to a date specified by the Committee and complying with Section 409A, to be granted automatically an Award of Stock Units with respect to such number of shares of Stock and upon such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee in lieu of:

^^^shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the exercise of an Option;

^^^cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the exercise of an SAR; or

^^^cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the settlement of a Performance Award.

^^**Terms and Conditions of Deferred Com****pensation Awards**. Deferred Compensation Awards granted pursuant to this Section 11 shall be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No such Deferred Compensation Award or purported Deferred Compensation Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing Deferred Compensation Awards may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A.

^^***Terms and Conditions of Stock Bonus Awards***. Stock Bonus Awards granted pursuant to this Section 11 shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 8.

^^***Terms and Condition***s of Stock Units. Except as provided below, Stock Units granted pursuant to this Section 11 shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 9.

^^^**Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and** **Distributions**. Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stockrepresented by Stock Units until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). However, a Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date the Stock

Units are granted automatically to the Participant and ending on the earlier of the date on which such Stock Units are settled or the date on which they are forfeited. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock. The number of additional Stock Units (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on the dividend payment date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Stock Units previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date. Such additional Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time (or as soon thereafter as practicable) as the Stock Units originally subject to the Stock Unit Award. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant’s Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award.

^^^**Settlement of Stock Unit Awards**. A Participant electing to receive an Award of Stock Units pursuant to this Section 11 shall specify at the time of such election a settlement date with respect to such Award which complies with Section 409A. The Company shall issue to the Participant on the settlement date elected by the Participant, or as soon thereafter as practicable, a number of whole shares of Stock equal to the number of vested Stock Units subject to the Stock Unit Award. Such shares of Stock shall be fully vested, and the Participant shall not be required to pay any additional consideration (other than applicable tax withholding) to acquire such shares.

^N**ONEMPLOYEE** D**IRECTOR** A**WARDS**.  
Nonemployee Director Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No Nonemployee Director Award or purported Nonemployee Director Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A if applicable, and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions.

^^**Terms and Conditions of Nonemployee Director Awards**. The Committee shall determine the forms and amounts of the Nonemployee Director Awards from time to time, which determination may include (but not be limited to) adopting policies with respect to granting Awards when a person first becomes a Nonemployee Director, granting Awards on an annual basis to Nonemployee Directors, and granting additional Awards on the basis of membership on or chairmanship of Board committees. The Committee shall establish the vesting and exercisability terms of all Nonemployee Director Awards, including Nonemployee Director Options. Awards granted pursuant to this Section 12 may consist of any type of Award authorized under the Plan, including Options, SARs, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Unit Awards, or any combination thereof.

^^**Terms and Conditions of Nonemployee Director Options**. To the extent the Committee determinates that Nonemployee Director Awards shall take the form of Nonemployee Director Options, then except as provided by this Section, Nonemployee Director Options shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 6.

^^***Exercise Price***. The exercise price per share of Stock subject to a Nonemployee Director Option shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of the Nonemployee Director Option.

^^***Exercisability and Term of Nonemployee Director Options***. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Award Agreement evidencing a Nonemployee Director Option and provided that the Participant’s Service has not terminated prior to the relevant date, each Nonemployee Director Option shall vest and become exercisable as set forth in the Award Agreement and shall terminate and cease to be exercisable on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant of the Nonemployee Director Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Plan or the Award Agreement evidencing such Option.

^^***Effect of Termination of Service***.  
^^^**Option Exercisability**. Subject to earlier termination of the Nonemployee Director Option as otherwise provided herein, a Nonemployee Director Option shall be exercisable after the Participant’s termination of Service only during the applicable time period determined in accordance with this Section and thereafter shall terminate:

^**Disability**. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the Disability of the Participant, any unexercisable or unvested portion of the Nonemployee Director Option shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated and may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

^**Death**. If the Participant’s Service terminates because of the death of the Participant, any unexercisable or unvested portion of the Nonemployee Director Option shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full on the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated and may be exercised by the Participant’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Nonemployee Director Option by reason of the Participant’s death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant’s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date. The Participant’s Service shall be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Participant dies within three (3) months after the Participant’s termination of Service.

^^^**Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of a Nonemployee Director Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 12.2(c)(i) is prevented by the provisions of Section 16 below, the Nonemployee Director Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months after the date the Participant is notified by the Company that the Nonemployee Director Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.

^^^**Extension if Participant Subject to Section 16(b)**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 12.2(c)(i) of shares acquired upon the exercise of the Nonemployee Director Option would subject the Participant to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Nonemployee Director Option shall remain exercisable until the earliest to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which a sale of such shares by the Participant would no longer be subject to such suit, (ii) the one hundred and ninetieth (190th) day after the Participant’s termination of Service, or (iii) the Option Expiration Date.

Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish. No such Award or purported Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement. Award Agreements evidencing Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference, including the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A, if applicable, and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

^^**Grant of Cash-Based Awards**. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Cash-Based Awards to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions, including the achievement of performance criteria, as the Committee may determine.

^^**Grant of Other Stock-Based Awards**. The Committee may grant other types of equity-based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms of this Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted securities, stock-equivalent units, stock appreciation units, securities or debentures convertible into common stock or other forms determined by the Committee) in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Such Awards may involve the transfer of actual shares of Stock to Participants, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Stock and may include, without limitation, Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United States.

^^**Value of Cash-Based and Other Stock-Based Awards**. Each Cash-Based Award shall specify a monetary payment amount or payment range as determined by the Committee. Each Other Stock-Based Award shall be expressed in terms of shares of Stock or units based on such shares of Stock, as determined by the Committee. The Committee may require the satisfaction of such Service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as shall be established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award. If the Committee exercises its discretion to establish performance criteria, the final value of Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid to the Participant will depend on the extent to which the performance criteria are met. The establishment of performance criteria with respect to the grant or vesting of any Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award intended to result in Performance-Based Compensation shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those applicable to Performance Awards set forth in Section 10.

^^**Payment or Settlement of Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based** **Awards**. Payment or settlement, if any, with respect to a Cash- Based Award or an Other Stock-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, in cash, shares of Stock or other securities or any combination thereof as the Committee determines. The determination and certification of the final value with respect to any Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award intended to result in Performance-Based Compensation shall comply with the requirements applicable to Performance Awards set forth in Section 10. To the extent applicable, payment or settlement with respect to each Cash-Based Award and Other Stock-Based Award shall be made in compliance with the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Code Section 409A.

^^**Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions**. Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Other Stock-Based Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares of Stock (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), if any, in settlement of such Award. However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Other Stock-Based Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date such Award is granted and ending, with respect to the particular shares subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date the Award is settled or the date on which it is terminated. Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 9.4. Dividend Equivalent rights shall not be granted with respect to Cash-Based Awards.

^^**Effect of Termination of Service**. Each Award Agreement evidencing a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to retain such Award following termination of the Participant’s Service. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, need not be uniform among all Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination.

^^**Nontransferability of Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Bas**ed** Awards**. Prior to the payment or settlement of a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-BasedAward, the Award shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee may impose such additional restrictions on any shares of Stock issued in settlement of Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, minimum holding period requirements, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such shares of Stock are then listed and/or traded, or under any state securities laws applicable to such shares of Stock.

^S**TANDARD** F**ORMS** OF A**WARD** A**GREEMENT**.  
^^**Award Agreements**. Each Award shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the appropriate form of Award Agreement approved by the Committee and as amended from time to time. Any Award Agreement may consist of an appropriate form of Notice of Grant and a form of Agreement incorporated therein by reference, or such other form or forms as the Committee may approve from time to time.

^^**Authority to Vary Terms**. The Committee shall have the authority from time to time to vary the terms of any standard form of Award Agreement either in connection with the grant or amendment of an individual Award or in connection with the authorization of a new standard form or forms; provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such new, revised or amended standard form or forms of Award Agreement are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.

^^***Accelerated Vesting***. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide in any Award Agreement or, in the event of a Change in Control, may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability and vesting in connection with such Change in Control of any or all outstanding Options and SARs and shares acquired upon the exercise of such Options and SARs upon such conditions, including termination of the Participant’s Service prior to, upon, or following such Change in Control, and to such extent as the Committee shall determine.

^^***Assumption or Substitution***. In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “***Acquiror***”), may, without the consent of any Participant, either assume or continue the Company’s rights and obligations under outstanding Options and SARs or substitute for outstanding Options and SARs substantially equivalent options and SARs (as the case may be) for the Acquiror’s stock. Any Options or SARs which are neither assumed or continued by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control.

^^***Cash-Out***. The Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Participant, determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each or any Option or SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control shall be canceled in exchange for a payment with respect to each vested share (and each unvested share, if so determined by the Committee) of Stock subject to such canceled Option or SAR in (i) cash, (ii) stock of the Company or of a corporation or other business entity a party to the Change in Control, or (iii) other property which, in any such case, shall be in an amount having a Fair Market Value equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control over the exercise price per share under such Option or SAR (the “***Spread***”). In the event such determination is made by the Committee, the Spread (reduced by applicable withholding taxes, if any) shall be paid to Participants in respect of the vested portion of their canceled Options and SARs as soon as practicable following the date of the Change in Control and in respect of the unvested portion of their canceled Options and SARs in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such Awards as in effect prior to the Change in Control.

^^**Effect of Change in Control on Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit** **Awards and Performance Awards**. Subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect toSection 409A if applicable, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award or Performance Award for, or in the event of a Change in control may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for, the lapsing of the Restriction Period applicable to the shares subject to the Stock Award (and, in the case of Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards, acceleration of the vesting and settlement of such Award) upon such conditions, including termination of the Participant’s Service prior to, upon, or following such Change in Control, and to such extent as the Committee shall determine.

^^**Effect of Change in Control on Deferred Compensation Awards**. Subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A if applicable, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Deferred Compensation Award that, in the event of a Change in Control, the Stock Awards or Stock Units pursuant to such Award shall become vested and, in the case of Stock Units, shall be settled effective as of the date of the Change in Control to such extent as specified in such Award Agreement.

^^**Effect of Change in Control on Nonemploye**e Director Awards. Subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A if applicable, any unexercisable or unvested portion of each outstanding Nonemployee Director Award and any shares acquired pursuant thereto shall be immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date of the Change in Control. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, each Nonemployee Director Award shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this Section 15.

^^**Effect of Change in Control on Cash-Base**d Awards and Other **Stock-Based Awards**. Subject to the provisions of Section 19 with respect to Section 409A ifapplicable, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award for, or in the event of a Change in control may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for, acceleration of the vesting and settlement of such Award upon such conditions, including termination of the Participant’s Service prior to, upon, or following such Change in Control, and to such extent as the Committee shall determine.

^C**OMPLIANCE** W**ITH** S**ECURITIES** L**AW**.  
The grant of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to any Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of such exercise or issuance be in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

^T**AX** W**ITHHOLDING**.  
^^**Tax Withholding in Gene****ral**. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any and all payments made under the Plan, or to require the Participant, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, to make adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to an Award or the shares acquired pursuant thereto. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock, to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to an Award Agreement, or to make any payment in cash under the Plan until the Participating Company Group’s tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant.

^^**Withholding in Shares**. The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise or settlement of an Award, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group. The Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.

^A**MENDMENT OR** T**ERMINATION OF** P**LAN**.  
The Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Section 4.4), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, and (c) no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company’s stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule, including the rules of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Award unless expressly provided by the Committee. Except as provided by the next sentence, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of any Participant, amend the Plan or any Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as it deems necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or such Award Agreement to any present or future law, regulation or rule applicable to the Plan, including, but not limited to, Section 409A.

^C**OMPLIANCE WITH** S**ECTION** **409A**.  
^^**Awards Subject to Section 409A**.

^^Each Deferred Compensation Award.

^^Any Restricted Stock Unit Award, Performance Award, Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award that either (i) provides by its terms for settlement of all or any portion of the Award on one or more dates following the Short-Term Deferral Period (as defined below) or (ii) permits or requires the Participant to elect one or more dates on which the Award will be settled.

Subject to any applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 409A or other applicable guidance, the term “***Short-Te******rm Deferral Period***” means the period ending on the later of (i) the date that is two and one-half months from the end of the Company’s fiscal year in which the applicable portion of the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or (ii) the date that is two and one-half months from the end of the Participant’s taxable year in which the applicable portion of the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For this purpose, the term “substantial risk of forfeiture” shall have the meaning set forth in any applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 409A or other applicable guidance.

^^**Deferral and/or Distribution Elections**. Except as otherwise permitted or required by Section 409A or any applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 409A or other applicable guidance, the following rules shall apply to any deferral and/or distribution elections (each, an “***Election***”) that may be permitted or required by the Committee pursuant to an Award subject to Section 409A:

^^All Elections must be in writing and specify the amount of the distribution in settlement of an Award being deferred, as well as the time and form of distribution as permitted by this Plan.

^^All Elections shall be made by the end of the Participant’s taxable year prior to the year in which services commence for which an Award may be granted to such Participant; provided, however, that if the Award qualifies as “performance-based compensation” for purposes of Section 409A and is based on services performed over a period of at least twelve (12) months, then the Election may be made no later than six (6) months prior to the end of such period.

^^Elections shall continue in effect until a written election to revoke or change such Election is received by the Company, except that a written election to revoke or change such Election must be made prior to the last day for making an Election determined in accordance with paragraph (b) above or as permitted by Section 19.3.

^^**Subsequent Elections**. Any Award subject to Section 409A which permits a subsequent Election to delay the distribution or change the form of distribution in settlement of such Award shall comply with the following requirements:

^^No subsequent Election may take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the subsequent Election is made;

^^Each subsequent Election related to a distribution in settlement of an Award not described in Section 19.4(b), 19.4(c), or 19.4(f) must result in a delay of the distribution for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date such distribution would otherwise have been made; and

^^No subsequent Election related to a distribution pursuant to Section 19.4(d) shall be made less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under such distribution.

^^Separation from service (as determined by the Secretary of the United States Treasury);

^^The date the Participant becomes Disabled (as defined below);

^^Death;   
^^A specified time (or pursuant to a fixed schedule) that is either (i) specified by the Committee upon the grant of an Award and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award or (ii) specified by the Participant in an Election complying with the requirements of Section 19.2 and/or 19.3, as applicable;

^^To the extent provided by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, a change in the ownership or effective control or the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company; or

^^The occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency (as defined below).

Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, to the extent that a Participant is a “Specified Employee” (as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)) of the Company, no distribution pursuant to Section 19.4(a) in settlement of an Award subject to Section 409A may be made before the date which is six (6) months after such Participant’s date of separation from service, or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death.

^^**Unforeseeable Emergency**. The Committee shall have the authority to provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Award subject to Section 409A for distribution in settlement of all or a portion of such Award in the event that a Participant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Committee, the occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency. In such event, the amount(s) distributed with respect to such Unforeseeable Emergency cannot exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such distribution(s), after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). All distributions with respect to an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Committee’s determination that an Unforeseeable Emergency has occurred.

The occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be judged and determined by the Committee. The Committee’s decision with respect to whether an Unforeseeable Emergency has occurred and the manner in which, if at all, the distribution in settlement of an Award shall be altered or modified, shall be final, conclusive, and not subject to approval or appeal.

^^**Disabled**. The Committee shall have the authority to provide in any Award subject to Section 409A for distribution in settlement of such Award in the event that the Participant becomes Disabled. A Participant shall be considered “Disabled” if either:

^^the Participant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, or

^^the Participant is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Participant’s employer.

All distributions payable by reason of a Participant becoming Disabled shall be paid in a lump sum or in periodic installments as established by the Participant’s Election, commencing as soon as practicable following the date the Participant becomes Disabled. If the Participant has made no Election with respect to distributions upon becoming Disabled, all such distributions shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date the Participant becomes Disabled.

^^**Death**. If a Participant dies before complete distribution of amounts payable upon settlement of an Award subject to Section 409A, such undistributed amounts shall be distributed to his or her beneficiary under the distribution method for death established by the Participant’s Election as soon as administratively possible following receipt by the Committee of satisfactory notice and confirmation of the Participant’s death. If the Participant has made no Election with respect to distributions upon death, all such distributions shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date of the Participant’s death.

^^**No Acceleration of Distributions**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Plan does not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any distribution under this Plan, except as provided by Section 409A and/or the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.

^M**ISCELLANEOUS** P**ROVISIONS**.  
^^**Repurchase Rights**. Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.

^^**Forfeiture Events**.  
^^The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant’s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of Service for Cause or any act by a Participant, whether before or after termination of Service, that would constitute Cause for termination of Service.

^^If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, any Participant who knowingly or through gross negligence engaged in the misconduct, or who knowingly or through gross negligence failed to prevent the misconduct, and any Participant who is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve - (12-) month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.

^^**Provision of Information**. Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company’s common stockholders.

^^**Rights as Employee, Consultant or Director**. No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant. Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any Participant a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant’s Service at any time. To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that Award shall in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee’s employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship with the Company.

^^**Rights as a Stockholder**. A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.4 or another provision of the Plan.

^^**Delivery of Title to Shares**. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued the shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award and shall deliver such shares to or for the benefit of the Participant by means of one or more of the following: (a) by delivering to the Participant evidence of book entry shares of Stock credited to the account of the Participant, (b) by depositing such shares of Stock for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship, or (c) by delivering such shares of Stock to the Participant in certificate form.

^^**Fractional Shares**. The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.

^^**Retirement and Welfare Plans**. Neither Awards made under this Plan nor shares of Stock or cash paid pursuant to such Awards may be included as “compensation” for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any Participant under any Participating Company’s retirement plans (both qualified and non-qualified) or welfare benefit plans unless such other plan expressly provides that such compensation shall be taken into account in computing a Participant’s benefit.

^^**Beneficiary Designation**. Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant’s death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant’s spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant’s spouse. If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant’s death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant’s legal representative.

^^**Severability**. If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

^^**No Constraint on Corporate Action**. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to: (a) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company’s or another Participating Company’s right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or, (b) limit the right or power of the Company or another Participating Company to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate.

^^**Unfunded Obligation**. Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company. Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations. The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder. Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant’s creditors in any assets of any Participating Company. The Participants shall have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.

^^**Choice of Law**. Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law rules.
