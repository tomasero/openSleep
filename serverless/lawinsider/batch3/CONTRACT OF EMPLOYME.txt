No previous period of employment shall count as continuous employment.

^^You shall establish to the Company’s satisfaction (through production of original documents reasonably requested by us) that you are entitled to live and work in the Czech Republic without any additional approvals. You will notify the Company immediately if you cease to be so entitled at any time during your employment with the Company.

^^You represent and warrant that you are not bound by or subject to any contract, court order, agreement, arrangement or undertaking which in any way restricts or prohibits you from entering into this Contract or performing your duties under it.

^^Your job title is Chief Financial Officer, reporting directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the [[Organization 2 Name]]. For purposes of this Contract, the “**[[Organization 2 Name]]**” shall mean [[Organization 3 Name]] (“**[[Organization 4 Name]]**”) and/or any Associated Company (as defined below).

^^From the Commencement Date, your basic salary is EUR 450,000 per year, payable monthly in arrears by credit transfer into your bank account after all necessary deductions for relevant taxes and social security payments. Your salary shall be payable in Czech koruna (CZK) based on the EUR-CZK exchange rate in effect on the Commencement Date in respect of the period through [[Date 2: Date]] and on each [[Date 3: Date]] in respect of each year thereafter. In the event the amount of salary you would have been entitled to receive in Czech korunas in any calendar year, following conversion of such amount using the average CZK-EUR exchange rate for such calendar year, is greater than the amount you did receive, the difference will be added to your salary payable in the first month of the following calendar year. In the event the amount of salary you would have been entitled to receive in Czech korunas in any calend ar year, following conversion of such amount using the average CZK-EUR exchange rate for such calendar year, is less than the amount you did receive, the difference will be withheld from your basic salary payable in the first month of the following calendar year.

^^Your salary will be reviewed on an annual basis. The first review will take place on or about the first anniversary of your Commencement Date. Any increase is entirely at the Company’s discretion.

The Company shall not have any liability to pay any benefit to you under any insurance scheme unless it receives payment of the benefit from the insurer under the scheme.

^^Any insurance scheme which is provided for you is also subject to the Company’s right to alter the cover provided or any term of the scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) the scheme at any time if in the reasonable opinion of the Company your state of health is or becomes such that the Company is unable to insure the benefits under the scheme at the normal premiums applicable.

^^The provision of any insurance scheme or any benefits hereunder does not in any way prevent the Company from lawfully terminating this Contract in accordance with the provisions in clause 9 even if to do so would deprive you of membership of or cover under any such scheme or benefit.

^^For a period of three years from the Commencement Date, provided you continue to be employed by the Company throughout such period, the Company shall pay you a monthly rental allowance of the Czech koruna equivalent of EUR 4,705.88 to be payable in monthly instalments at the same time and by the same method as your salary is paid (the “**Monthly Allowance**”).

The exercise price for such options shall be the closing price of the shares of Class A Common Stock of [[Organization 4 Name]] on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant. Such grant of options shall vest in four equal instalments over a period of four years and shall otherwise be subject to the Plan.

^^The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that you are qualified as an officer under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy taken out by the [[Organization 2 Name]].

All payments made pursuant to this clause 9.2 shall be subject to deductions for income tax and social security contributions as appropriate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination shall not be treated as Termination for Cause unless the Company has delivered a written notice to you stating that it intends to terminate your employment due to Termination for Cause and specifying the basis for such termination.

^^On (i) the date of termination of this Contract pursuant to clause 9.3, or (ii) the effective date of a Change of Control (as defined in Annex 1 hereto), all options and restricted stock units granted to you pursuant to the Plan shall become automatically exercisable for a period of twelve months from such date, after which they shall expire.

^^Upon the termination by whatever means of this Contract you shall immediately return to the Company all documents, computer media and hardware, credit cards, mobile phones and communication devices, keys and all other property belonging to or relating to the business of the Company which is in your possession or under your power or control and you must not retain copies of any of the above.
