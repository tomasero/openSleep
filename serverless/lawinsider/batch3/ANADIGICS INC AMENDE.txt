The express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to other members of the Board or officers or managers of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate the autho rity, subject to such terms as the Committee shall determine, to perform administrative functions and, with respect to Awards granted to persons not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to perform such other functions as the Committee may determine, to the extent permitted under Rule 16b-3 (if applicable) and applicable law.

^^**No Option or SAR Repricing Without Shareholder Approval**. Except as provided in the first sentence of Section 4(c) hereof relating to certain antidilution adjustments, unless the approval of shareholders of the Company is obtained, Options and SARs issued under the Plan shall not be amended to lower their exercise price and Options and SARs issued under the Plan will not be exchanged for other Options or SARs with lower exercise prices or for other awards the effect of which would be a repricing of the Options or SARs.

^^**Limitation on Committee’s Authority under 409A**. Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee’s authority to modify outstanding Awards shall be limited to the extent necessary so that the existence of such authority does not (i) cause an Award that is not otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code to become deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code or (ii) cause an Award that is otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code to fail to meet the requirements prescribed by Section 409A of the Code.

^^Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) hereof, (i) the total number of Shares reserved for issuance in connection with Awards under the Plan shall be 16,050,000, and (ii) the total number of Shares reserved for issuance in connection with Awards other than Options (**i.e**., SARs, Restricted Share, Restricted Unit, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Dividend Equivalents and Other Share-Based Awards) shall be 15,750,000. No Award may be granted if the number of Shares to which such Award relates, when added to the number of Shares previously issued under the Plan, exceeds the number of Shares reserved under the applicable provisions of the preceding sentence. If any Awards are forfeited, canceled, terminated, exchanged or surrendere d or such Award is settled in cash or otherwise terminates without a distribution of Shares to the Participant, any Shares counted against the number of Shares reserved and available under the Plan with respect to such Award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture, settlement, termination, cancellation, exchange or surrender, again be available for Awards under the Plan. Upon the exercise of any Award granted in tandem with any other Awards, such related Awards shall be canceled to the extent of the number of Shares as to which the Award is exercised.

^^Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) hereof, the maximum number of Shares (i) with respect to which Options or SARs may be granted during a calendar year to any Eligible Person under this Plan shall be [[Shares 1: Number]] Shares, and (ii) with respect to Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code shall be the equivalent of [[Shares 1]] Shares during a calendar year to any Eligible Person under this Plan.

^^In the event that the Committee shall determine that any dividend in Shares, recapitalization, Share split, reverse split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share exchange, extraordinary distribution or other similar corporate transaction or event, affects the Shares such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Eligible Persons under the Plan, then the Committee shall make such equitable changes or adjustments as it deems appropriate and, in such manner as it may deem equitable (i), adjust any or all of (x) the number and kind of shares which may thereafter be issued under the Plan, (y) the number and kind of shares, other securities or other consideration issued or issuable in respect of outstanding Awards, and (z) the exercise pri ce, grant price, or purchase price relating to any Award, or (ii) provide for a distribution of cash or property in respect of any Award; **provided, however**, in each case that, with respect to ISOs, such adjustment shall be made in accordance with Section 424(a) of the Code, unless the Committee determines otherwise and **provided**further**, that no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(c) that causes any Award that is not otherwise deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code to become deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code. In addition, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria and performance objectives, if any, included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence) affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles; provided, however**, that, if an Award Agreement specifically so provides, the Committee shall not have discretion to increase the amount of compensation payable under the Award to the extent such an increase would cause the Award to lose its qualification as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

^^Any Shares distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or treasury Shares including Shares acquired by purchase in the open market or in private transactions.

^^^**ISOs**. The terms of any ISO granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, including but not limited to the requirement that the ISO shall be granted within ten years from the earlier of the date of adoption or shareholder approval of the Plan.

^^^The Committee shall determine, at the time of grant, the time or times at which a SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (which shall not be more than ten years after the date of grant of the SAR), the method of exercise, method of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, method by which Shares will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Eligible Persons, whether or not a SAR shall be in tandem with any other Award, and any other terms and conditions of any SAR.

If certificates representing Restricted Shares are registered in the name of the Eligible Person, such certificates shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Shares and, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Company shall retain physical possession of the certificate and the Participant shall deliver a stock power to the Company, endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Shares.

^^^**Forfeiture**. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at the date of grant or thereafter, upon Termination of Service during the applicable deferral period or portion thereof to which forfeiture conditions apply (as provided in the Award Agreement evidencing the Restricted Share Units), or upon failure to satisfy any other conditions precedent to the delivery of Shares or cash to which such Restricted Share Units relate, all Restricted Share Units that are at that time subject to deferral or restriction shall be forfeited; **provided, however**, that the Committee may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agree ment, or may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Share Units will be waived in whole or in part in the event of Termination of Service resulting from specified causes, and the Committee may in other cases waive in whole or in part the forfeiture of Restricted Share Units.

Performance Periods may overlap and Eligible Persons may participate simultaneously with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units for which different Performance Periods are prescribed.

^^^**Award Value**. At the beginning of a Performance Period, the Committee shall determine for each Eligible Person or group of Eligible Persons with respect to that Performance Period the range of number of Shares, if any, in the case of Performance Shares, and the range of dollar values, if any, in the case of Performance Units, which may be fixed or may vary in accordance with such performance or other criteria specified by the Committee, which shall be paid to an Eligible Person as an Award if the relevant measure of Company performance for the Performance Period is met.

^^^**Significant Events**. If during the course of a Performance Period there shall occur significant events as determined by the Committee which the Committee expects to have a substantial effect on a performance objective during such period, the Committee may revise such objective; **provided, however**, that, if an Award Agreement so provides, the Committee shall not have any discretion to increase the amount of compensation payable under the Award to the extent such an increase would cause the Award to lose its qualification as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code and the regulations t hereunder.

^^^Performance Awards.

^^**Performance Awards Granted to Covered Employees**.

The Company, in its discretion, may postpone the issuance or delivery of Shares under any Award until completion of such stock exchange or market system listing or registration or qualification of such Shares or any required action under any state, federal or foreign law, rule or regulation as the Company may consider appropriate, and may require any Participant to mak e such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. No provisions of the Plan shall be interpreted or construed to obligate the Company to register any Shares under federal, state or foreign law. The Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to such other restrictions on transfer as determined by the Committee.

^^**No Right to Continued Employment or Service**. Neither the Plan nor any action taken thereunder shall be construed as giving any employee, consultant or director the right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate any employee’s, consultant’s or director’s employment or service at any time.

^^**Taxes**. The Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate is authorized to withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award under the Plan, including from a distribution of Shares, or any payroll or other payment to an Eligible Person, amounts of withholding and other taxes due in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company and Eligible Persons to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award. This authority shall include authority to withhold or receive Shares or other property and to make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of an Eligible Person’s tax obligat ions; **provided, however**, that the amount of tax withholding to be satisfied by withholding Shares shall be limited to the minimum amount of taxes, including employment taxes, required to be withheld under applicable Federal, state and local law.

^^**Changes to the Plan and Awards**. The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or the Committee’s authority to grant Awards under the Plan without the consent of shareholders of the Company or Participants, except that any such amendment or alteration shall be subject to the approval of the Company’s shareholders (i) to the extent such shareholder approval is required under the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, or (ii) as it applies to ISOs, to the extent such shareholder approval is required under Section 422 of the Code; **provided, however**, that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or termination of the Plan may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any Award theretofore granted to him or her.

No Eligible Person or employee shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons and employees.

^^**Nonexclusivity of the Plan**. Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor its submission to the shareholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of options and other awards otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable generally or only in specific cases.

^^**Not Compensation for Benefit Plans**. No Award payable under this Plan shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any benefit plan or other arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees, consultants or directors unless the Company shall determine otherwise.
