^Section 7.2(f) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following at the end thereof: 

“Prior to the Release Date, if any Borrower shall acquire a commercial tort claim in excess of $[[USD Value 1]] such Borrower shall promptly notify [[Organization 2 Name]] in a writing signed by the applicable Borrower of the general details thereof and grant to [[Organization 2 Name]] in such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to [[Organization 2 Name]]. In addition, each Borrower shall at any time and from time to time execute any further instruments and take further action as [[Organization 2 Name]] may reasonably request to perfect or continue [[Organization 2 Name]]’s Lien in the Collateral as contemplated by this Agreement.” 

^The following new Section 7.4 is inserted into the Loan Agreement, immediately following Section 7.3 thereof:

Promptly upon receipt from Borrowers of release and discharge documentation evidencing the termination of SVB’s liens on the Collateral, as provided herein, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to [[Organization 2 Name]], [[Organization 2 Name]] and, to the extent applicable, the Borrowers shall enter into such documentation, including without limitation, UCC termination statements, intellectual property filings, releases and discharge documents, which are reasonably necessary to effectuate such release, all at the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers. For the avoidance of debt, [[Organization 2 Name]] and the Borrowers agree that the first priority perfected Liens on, and security interest of [[Organization 2 Name]] in, the Original Collateral shall at all times remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any release by [[Organization 2 Name]] of the any collateral which is not Original Collateral.”
