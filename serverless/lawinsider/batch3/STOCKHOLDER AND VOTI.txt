^^ \centered **AGREEMENT** 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

\centered **VOTING AGREEMENT**

^^Agreement to Vote Subject Shares. From the date hereof through the earlier of: (a) the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement; (b) the termination of the Transaction Agreement in accordance with its terms and (c) such time as the Company Board withholds, withdraws or modifies its recommendation with respect to the Company Voting Proposal, (the periods set forth in such clauses (a), (b) or (c), the “Pre-Closing Period”), at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company called to consider and vote upon the adoption and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement (and at any and all postponements and adjournments thereof), and in connection with any other action to be taken in respect of the adoption and approval of the Transaction Agreement by written consent of stockholders of Company, the Stockholders shall vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent, if applicable) all of the Subject Shares, whether heretofore owned or hereinafter acquired, in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger and in favor of any other matter necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement (collectively, the “Transaction”), and considered and voted upon at any such meeting or made the subject of any such written consent, as applicable. During the Pre-Closing Period, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company called to consider and vote upon any Other Proposal (as hereinafter defined) (and at any and all

postponements and adjournments thereof), and in connection with any action to be taken in respect of any Other Proposal by written consent of stockholders of Company, the Stockholders shall vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent, if applicable) all of the Subject Shares against such Other Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Other Proposal” means any (x) proposal to acquire the stock or assets of the Company made by any person or group other than the Buyer or (y) other action which is intended or could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay or materially and adversely affect the contemplated economic benefits to the Buyer of the Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; *provided, however,* that neither the Transaction nor any other transaction contemplated by the Transaction Agreement to be consummated by the Buyer and the Company in connection therewith shall constitute an Other Proposal. The Stockholders shall not enter into any agreement or understanding with any person or entity the effect of which would be a violation of the provisions and agreements contained in this Section 1.1. For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is not a voting trust pursuant to Delaware law.

^^Irrevocable Proxy.

^^Grant of Proxy. SOLELY IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE BY A STOCKHOLDER TO VOTE ITS SUBJECT SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 1.1 OF THIS AGREEMENT, UPON SUCH EVENT EACH SUCH STOCKHOLDER HEREBY APPOINTS THE BUYER AND ANY DESIGNEE OF THE BUYER, EACH OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY, EACH STOCKHOLDER’S PROXY, WITH THE IRREVOCABLE FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION AND RESUBSTITUTION, TO VOTE OR ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT SHARES ONLY TO VOTE THE SUBJECT SHARES AS INDICATED IN SECTION 1.1 HEREOF. THIS PROXY IS GIVEN TO SECURE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES OF EACH STOCKHOLDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH STOCKHOLDER AFFIRMS THAT THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE. EACH STOCKHOLDER SHALL TAKE SUCH FURTHER ACTION OR EXECUTE SUCH OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY.

^^Other Proxies Revoked. Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly, represents that any proxies heretofore given in respect of the Subject Shares of such Stockholder are not irrevocable, and that all such proxies are hereby revoked.

^^No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, or the Company any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Subject Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholders, and the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, and the Company shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct the Stockholders in the voting of any of the Subject Shares, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, or in the performance of the Stockholders’ duties or responsibilities as stockholders of the Company.

^^Stockholder Capacity. Each Stockholder is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as a record holder and/or beneficial owner of Subject Shares and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to impose any obligation, restriction, limitation or liability on such Stockholder, or any of such Stockholder’s officers, directors, employees, partners, members, agents or representatives (as the case may be), in any other manner or capacity including, without limitation in any capacity as an officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to impose any obligation, restriction, limitation or liability on any Stockholder as a result of any action or inaction of any other stockholder of the Company. In no event shall any Stockholder have any liability for any breach by any other Stockholder of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made by such other Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement.

During the Pre-Closing Period, each Stockholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to or permitted by the terms and conditions of this Agreement: (i) offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, loan, pledge, encumber, assign, or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, or other arrangement or understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment, or other disposition of, grant any rights with respect to, or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might be reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) of any right, title and interest any or all of the Subject Shares; (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any of the Subject Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of the Subject Shares; or (iii) take any action that would make any representation or warranty contained herein untrue, inaccurate or incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of materially impairing the ability of such Stockholder to perform such Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement or preventing or materially delaying the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Transaction Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(a), a Stockholder may take any of the actions described in Section 3.1(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) if (x) the person receiving all or any portion of the Subject Shares or interest therein or (y) the person receiving the proxy or entering into any voting trust, power-of-attorney or other agreement or arrangement with respect to any voting of any Subject Shares during the term of this Agreement, agrees in writing, in an instrument reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, to be bound by this Agreement as a Stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Stockholder may convert its shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock (which resulting shares of Company Common Stock would remain subject to the terms of this Agreement as “Subject Shares”) and each Stockholder may take such actions as may be required in connection with a redemption by the Company of shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock.

^^No Solicitation. From and after the time of the No-Shop Start Date, each Stockholder shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any director, officer, employee or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, such Stockholder (collectively, the “Stockholder Representatives”) to, directly or indirectly, knowingly (A) initiate, solicit or encourage any Acquisition Proposal, or (B) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person making any Acquisition Proposal. From and after the time of the No-Shop Start Date, each Stockholder shall immediately cease and terminate, and shall cause its Stockholder Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) if the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives has provided information to or entered into discussions or negotiations with, in each case in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1 of the Transaction Agreement, any person or persons in response to an Acquisition Proposal made by such person or persons, then each Stockholder and its Stockholder Representatives may provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or persons as and to the extent that the Company, its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives is permitted to do so pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement and (y) each Stockholder shall be permitted to comply with its disclosure obligations under applicable law.

^^Timing of Payment. On account of the Stockholders entering into this Agreement, the Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) concurrent with the Effective Time the Common Merger Consideration to each Stockholder for the shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by each such Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon a conversion of shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock), by wire transfer in immediately available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided by each such Stockholder to the Buyer prior to the Effective Time. The Buyer’s obligations under this Section 3.2 to each Stockholder are subject to its receipt from a Stockholder prior to the Effective Time of fully executed letters of transmittal in a form provided by the Buyer that is reasonable and customary for the Company Common Stock (“Letters of Transmittal”). The Buyer agrees to deliver or cause to be delivered to each Stockholder, not less than ten (10) full calendar days prior to the Effective Time, one or more Letters of Transmittal to be completed by each such Stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Buyer fails to deliver such Letters of Transmittal to a Stockholder within such ten (10) full calendar day period, such Stockholder shall not be obligated to complete such Letters of Transmittal as a condition of receiving the Common Merger Consideration concurrent with the Effective Time as provided in this Section 3.2.
