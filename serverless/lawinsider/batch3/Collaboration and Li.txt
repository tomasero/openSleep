In the event that the average sales price of both the Collaboration Product or Reverted Product and the other active compounds or ingredients in the Combination Product cannot be determined, the Net Sales of the Collaboration Product or Reverted Product shall be negotiated in good faith by the parties.

The Net Sales price for a Combination Product in a given country will be calculated once each Contract Year and such price will be used during all applicable royalty reporting periods for the entire Contract Year for such country, absent extraordinary conditions or events. When determining the average sale price of a Collaboration Product or Reverted Product or the other active compounds or ingredients in the Combination Product, the average sale price will be calculated using data arising from the twelve (12) months preceding the calculation of the Net Sales price for the Combination Product. As used above, the term “**Combination Product**” means any Collaboration Product or Reverted Product sold in conjunction with any other active compon ent(s) (whether packaged together or in the same therapeutic formulation).

Free samples of Collaboration Product or Reverted Product and the disposition of Collaboration Product or Reverted Product for, or the use of Collaboration Product or Reverted Product in, human clinical trials in which such Collaboration Product or Reverted Product is provided to patients without any payment shall not result in any Net Sales.

Neither party shall settle or otherwise agree to the final disposition of any claim or proceeding relating to Program Patent Rights Controlled in whole or in part by the other party or licensed under this Agreement to the other party without the prior written consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

11.4.5 **Non-Product-Related Infringement**. Each party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to institute and direct legal proceedings against any Third Party believed to be infringing the Program Patent Rights solely owned by such party other than infringement relating to a Collaboration Product. All costs, including attorneys’ fees, relating to such legal proceedings shall be borne by the party instituting such legal proceedings, and all recoveries resulting from such legal proceedings shall be retained by such party. The parties shall consult with each other regarding the institution, prosecution and control of any action or proceeding with respect to infringe ment of any of the Program Patent Rights jointly owned by the parties other than infringement relating to a Collaboration Product.

^^**Notices of Other Proceedings**.  
11.5.1 Each party shall notify the other in writing of any allegations it receives from a Third Party that the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of Program Technology, Program Materials or any Collaboration Product infringes the intellectual property rights of such Third Party. Such notice shall be provided promptly following receipt of such allegations.

11.5.2 In the event that a party receives notice that it or any of its Affiliates have been individually named as a defendant in a legal proceeding by a Third Party alleging infringement of a Third Party patent or other intellectual property right as a result of the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of Program Technology, Program Materials or a Collaboration Product, such party shall immediately notify the other party in writing after the receipt of such notice. Such written notice shall include a copy of any summons or complaint (or the equivalent thereof) received regarding the foregoing.

^^**Nondisclosure Obligations**.  
12.1.1 **General**. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 12, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, each Receiving Party shall maintain the Confidential Information of each Disclosing Party in confidence and use it only for purposes specifically authorized under this Agreement.

12.1.2 **Limitations**. To the extent it is reasonably necessary or appropriate to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement and subject to advance written notification to the Disclosing Party: (a) a party may disclose to Third Parties Confidential Information it is otherwise obligated not to disclose under this Section 12.1, to its Affiliates, (sub)licensees, consultants, outside contractors and clinical investigators, on a strict need-to-know basis for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement and on condition that such entities or persons agree to keep the Confidential Information confidential for the same time periods and to the same extent as such party is requi red to keep the Confidential Information confidential hereunder; and (b) a party or its (sub)licensees may disclose, using appropriate measures to preserve confidentiality, such Confidential Information to government or other regulatory authorities to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to obtain authorizations to conduct clinical trials of, and to commercially market, Collaboration Products pursuant to this Agreement. Furthermore, a Receiving Party may request permission from the Disclosing Party to disclose such Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to [**].

12.1.3 **Required Disclosure**. A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands that are issued by a competent court or governmental agency or as otherwise clearly and specifically required by Law; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party promptly upon receipt thereof, giving [**] the Disclosing Party sufficient advance notice to permit it to oppose, limit or seek confidential treatment for such disclosure; and provided, further, that the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required whether or not a protective order or other similar order is obtained by the Disclosing Party.

^^**Injunctive Relief**. The parties hereto understand and agree that remedies at law may be inadequate to protect against any breach of any of the provisions of this Article 12 by either party or its employees, agents, officers or directors or any other person acting in concert with it or on its behalf. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to the granting of injunctive relief by a court of competent jurisdiction against any action that constitutes any such breach of this Article 12.

^^**Publication**. [[Organization 1 Name]] and Lexicon (each, a “**Submitting Party**”) may each publish or present data and results relating to a Collaboration Product or Reverted Product for which the Submitting Party holds a commercial license under Section 8.2 hereof, subject to the prior review of the proposed disclosure by the other party (each, a “**Reviewing Party**”), solely to determine (a) whether the proposed disclosure contains the Confidential Information of the Reviewing Party or (b) whether the information contained in the proposed disclosur e should be the subject of a patent application to be filed by the Reviewing Party prior to such disclosure. Each Submitting Party shall provide the Reviewing Party with the opportunity to review any proposed abstract, manuscript or presentation by delivering a copy thereof to the Reviewing Party no less than [**] before its intended submission for publication or presentation. The Reviewing Party shall have [**] from its receipt of any such abstract, manuscript or presentation in which to notify the Submitting Party in writing of any specific objections to the disclosure, based on either the need to seek patent protection or concern regarding the specific disclosure of the Confidential Information of the Reviewing Party. In the event the Reviewing Party objects to the disclosure, the Submitting Party agrees not to submit the publication or abstract or make the presentation containing the objected-to information until the Reviewing Party is given a reasonable additional period of time (not to exceed an additional [**]) to seek patent protection for any material in the disclosure which the Reviewing Party believes is patentable or, in the case of Confidential Information, to allow the Submitting Party to delete any Confidential Information of the Reviewing Party from the proposed disclosure. The Submitting Party agrees to delete from the proposed disclosure any Confidential Information of the Reviewing Party upon request.

^^**Limited Liability**. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER LEXICON NOR [[Organization 1 Name]] WILL BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS.

^^**Lexicon Indemnity Obligations**. Lexicon agrees to defend, indemnify and hold [[Organization 1 Name]], its Affiliates and their respective employees and agents harmless from all claims, losses, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation) arising as a result of: (a) actual or asserted violations of any applicable law or regulation by Lexicon, its (sub)licensees and their respective Affiliates by virtue of which any Reverted Products manufactured, distributed or sold by Lexicon hereunder shall be alleged or determined to be adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled or otherwise not in compliance with any applicable law or regulation; (b) claims for bodily injury, d eath or property damage attributable to the manufacture, distribution, sale or use of any Reverted Products by Lexicon, its (sub)licensees and their respective Affiliates; (c) a recall of a Reverted Product manufactured, distributed or sold by Lexicon hereunder ordered by a governmental agency or required by a confirmed Reverted Product failure as reasonably determined by the parties hereto; or (d) Lexicon’s breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder.

^^**[[Organization 1 Name]] Indemnity Obligations**. [[Organization 1 Name]] agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Lexicon, its Affiliates and their respective employees and agents harmless from all claims, losses, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation) arising as a result of: (a) actual or asserted violations of any applicable law or regulation by [[Organization 1 Name]], its (sub)licensees and their respective Affiliates by virtue of which any Collaboration Products manufactured, distributed or sold by [[Organization 1 Name]] hereunder shall be alleged or determined to be adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled or otherwise not in compliance with any applicable law or reg ulation; (b) claims for bodily injury, death or property damage attributable to the manufacture, distribution, sale or use of any Collaboration Products by [[Organization 1 Name]], its (sub)licensees and their respective Affiliates; (c) a recall of an Collaboration Product manufactured, distributed or sold by [[Organization 1 Name]] hereunder ordered by a governmental agency or required by a confirmed Collaboration Product failure as reasonably determined by the parties hereto; or (d) [[Organization 1 Name]]’s breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder.

^^**Limitation on Indemnity Obligations**. Neither party, its Affiliates or their respective employees and agents shall be entitled to the indemnities set forth in Sections 14.1 or 14.2, respectively, to the comparative extent the claim, loss, damage or expense for which indemnification is sought was caused by a grossly negligent, reckless or intentional act or omission by such party, its directors, officers, employees or authorized agents.

^^**Procedure**. If a party or any of its Affiliates or their respective employees or agents (collectively, the “**Indemnitee**”) intends to claim indemnification under this Article 14, the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the other party (the “**Indemnitor**”) of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the Indemnitor shall assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, provided, however, that an Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnitee, if representation of such Indemnitee by the counsel retained by the Indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnitee and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceedings. The Indemnitor shall have the right to settle or compromise any claims for which it is providing indemnification under this Article 14, provided that the consent of the Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required in the event any such settlement or compromise would adversely affect the interests of the Indemnitee. The indemnity agreement in this Article 14 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor. The failur e to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to the Indemnitor’s ability to defend such action, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 14, but the omission so to deliver notice to the Indemnitor will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee otherwise than under this Article 14. The Indemnitee under this Article 14, its employees and agents, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any action, claim or liability covered by this indemnification.

^^**Insurance**. [[Organization 1 Name]] and Lexicon shall maintain appropriate product liability insurance or maintain adequate self-insurance reserves with respect to Development, manufacture and Commercialization of Collaboration Products and Reverted Products, respectively, by such party in such amount as such party customarily maintains with respect to sales of its other products. Each party shall maintain such insurance for so long as it continues to manufacture or sell Collaboration Products or Reverted Products, as applicable, and thereafter for so long as such party customarily maintains insurance with respect to sales of its other products.

^^**Term of Agreement**. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the earlier of (a) the time, if applicable, that all Program Targets have become Released Targets, and (b) on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the expiration of the royalty term with respect to the relevant Collaboration Product or Reverted Product in such country under Section 10.4.2 or 10.6.2, as applicable.

^^**Events of Default**. An “Event of Default” by either party mean any of the following events: (a) the occurrence of a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the diligence obligations of the parties under Sections 9.1 and 9.4, respectively) if such party fails to remedy such breach within [**] after written notice thereof by the non-breaching party ([**] in the event of a party’s failure to make a payment required hereunder) or, if remediation of such breach in [**] is not practicable, if such party fails to commence and diligently pursue such remediation during such [**] period, or (b) the commencement of any proceeding in or for b ankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up by or against such party that is not dismissed or otherwise disposed of within [**] thereafter.

^^**Effect of an Event of Default**. In the event of an Event of Default, the non-defaulting party shall have the right, at its option exercisable in its sole discretion, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it at law or in equity and subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3.7.2, 13.4 and 16.7 hereof (and except as provided in Sections 9.2 and 9.4), to terminate this Agreement upon [**] notice thereof to the other party, in which case (a) the licenses granted to the defaulting party pursuant to Article 8 shall terminate and (b) the defaulting party shall return to the non-defaulting party or, upon the non-defaulting party’s option, destroy all information, mater ials or documentation provided by the non-defaulting party pursuant to this Agreement; provided that such termination shall apply to the rights and licenses granted to the defaulting party under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 with respect to a Collaboration Product or Reverted Product only in the event, and to the extent, that such Event of Default relates to such specific Collaboration Product or Reverted Product. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination rights of the non-defaulting party under this Section 15.3 shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it at law or in equity. The rights and licenses granted to the defaulting party under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 with respect to any Collaboration Product or Reverted Product with respect to which no Event of Default has occurred shall, subject to such party’s applicable obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto, continue. In the e vent that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 15.3, the defaulting party’s obligations under the exclusivity provisions set forth in Section 2.4 shall survive for five (5) years following such termination.

^^**Effect of Expiration or Termination of Agreement**. The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the parties of any obligation accruing prior to such expiration or termination. The provisions of Articles 11, 12 and 14 and Sections 16.2 through 16.6 hereof shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. The rights and licenses granted to the non-defaulting party under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement by such non-defaulting party pursuant to Section 15.3. The provisions of Sections 10.3 through 10.8 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement under which Schering-P lough, its (sub)licensees or their respective Affiliates retains the right to sell Collaboration Products until such time as this Agreement would have expired with respect to any Collaboration Product, as the case may be, in any country pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof had this Agreement not been earlier terminated.

^^**Force Majeure**. Neither party shall be held liable or responsible to the other party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any obligation under this Agreement when such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, including but not limited to fire, floods, embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war is declared or not), insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any governmental authority; provided, however, that the party so affected shall use reasonable commercial efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance, and shall continue performance hereunder with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed. Either party shall provide the other party with prompt written notice of any delay or failure to perform that occurs by reason of force majeure.

^^**Assignment**. This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, by either party without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that either Lexicon or [[Organization 1 Name]] may, without such consent, assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (a) to any Affiliate, or (b) in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of such portion of a party’s assets that includes rights under this Agreement to an unrelated Third Party; provided, further, that such party’s rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be assumed by its successor in interest in any such transaction and shall not be transferred separate from all or substantially all of its other business assets, including those business assets that are the subject of this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Any permitted assignee shall assume all obligations of its assignor under this Agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree.

^^**Change of Control**.  

16.3.1 **Change of Control of [[Organization 1 Name]]** In the event that [[Organization 1 Name]] or its parent corporation enters into a transaction with a Third Party that had revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products, in the most-recently-completed calendar year preceding the date of the transaction, of at least ten billion dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]), which transaction results in such Third Party becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities representing fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) or more of either (a) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of [[Organization 1 Name]] or its parent corporation, or (b) the combined voting power of the then-outsta nding voting securities of [[Organization 1 Name]] or its parent corporation, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, provided that [[Organization 1 Name]] or its Third Party successor shall have [**] after such transaction, or [**] after the Effective Date in the case of [[Organization 7 Name]], Inc. as the successor, to designate a Program Target as a Released Target pursuant to Section 2.3 herein (subject to Lexicon’s right, under Section 2.3, to designate such Program Target as a Reverted Target) because of an overlapping program at such Third Party successor.

16.3.2 **Change of Control of Lexicon**. In the event that Lexicon enters into a transaction with a Third Party that had revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products, in the most-recently-completed calendar year preceding the date of the transaction, of at least ten billion dollars ($[[USD Value 1]]), which transaction results in such Third Party becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities representing fifty percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) or more of either (a) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Lexicon, or (b) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of Lexicon, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that any Joint Management Committee and Joint Research Committee in effect shall terminate immediately and [[Organization 1 Name]] shall no longer be obligated to provide reports to Lexicon or its Third Party successor with respect to [[Organization 1 Name]] or Development efforts under Sections 2.2.4 or 6.3.

^^**Severability**. Each party hereby agrees that it does not intend to violate any public policy, statutory or common laws, rules, regulations, treaty or decision of any government agency or executive body thereof of any country or community or association of countries. Should one or more provisions of this Agreement be or become invalid, the parties hereto shall substitute, by mutual consent, valid provisions for such invalid provisions which valid provisions in their economic effect are sufficiently similar to the invalid provisions that it can be reasonably assumed that the parties would have entered into this Agreement with such valid provisions in lieu of such invalid provisions.& #160; In case such valid provisions cannot be agreed upon, the invalidity of one or several provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, unless the invalid provisions are of such essential importance to this Agreement that it is to be reasonably assumed that the parties would not have entered into this Agreement without the invalid provisions.

^^**Notices**. Any consent, notice or report required or permitted to be given or made under this Agreement by one of the notification parties hereto to the other shall be in writing, delivered personally or by facsimile (and promptly confirmed by telephone, personal delivery or courier) or courier, postage prepaid (where applicable), addressed to such other party at its address indicated below, or to such other address as the addressee shall have last furnished in writing to the addressor and shall be effective upon receipt by the addressee.
