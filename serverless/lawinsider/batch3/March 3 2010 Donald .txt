We are also offering you two stock options, one in the amount of [[Shares 1: Number]] shares of our Common Stock that will be issued under Satcon’s 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) and one that will be issued outside of the Plan in the amount of [[Shares 1]] shares of our Common Stock (individually, an “Option” and, collectively, the “Options”).

Except as set forth below, any unvested shares under the Options will expire on the last day of your employment and each Option will expire at the earlier of ten years after the date of grant, if you remain an active employee at that time, or 90 days after you are no longer employed by Satcon hereunder (unless you are terminated for “Cause” (as hereinafter defined) in which case it will expire immediately). If your employment is terminated without Cause or is Constructively Terminated (as such term is hereinafter defined) or you become subject to a Disability (as such term is defined under the Plan) or die while you are employed by the Company you or your Estate shall have 12 months after such termination without Cause,
