All boxes on a EURO pallet at least have to be secured and made safe for transport by wrapping foil. The number of packaged items has to be documented on the delivery note and the accompanying shipping documents.

Please avoid padding wherever possible. Any wrapping and any padding should be made of one type of materials for environmental reasons. Padding must not be made of plastics, polystyrene or industrial waste material.

Only EURO-pallets (120 x 80 cm) may be used! The total height (incl. Pallet base) must not exceed 150 cm. Projections of up to 5 cm will be tolerated. In principal all pallets have to be delivered only with one type of goods and the packaging units have to be assembled on the pallet so that the labels can be read from the front (the side with dimensions of 80 cm). Two articles per pallet may be delivered if it is possible to clearly keep the boxes apart in two halves (40 x 120 each) and all the other requirements can be fulfilled.
