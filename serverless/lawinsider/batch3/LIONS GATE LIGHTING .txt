The number of Shares purchasable hereunder and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4 hereof.

This Warrant is being issued as part of units (the “**Units**”) issued by the Company in a private placement pursuant to the Company’s Confidential Private Placement Memorandum dated [[Date 1: Date]], as amended and/or supplemented (the “**PPM**”) and accompanying Subscription Agreement (the “Agreement”).

The purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, for cash only, by the Holder, in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise form (the "**Notice of Exercise**") attached hereto as Exhibit A duly executed) at the principal office of the Company, and by payment to the Company of an amount equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of the Shares being purchased, which amount may be paid, at the election of the Holder, by wire transfer or certified check payable to the order of the Company. The person or persons in whose name(s) any certificate(s) representing Shares shall be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of, the Shares represented thereby (and such Shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the close of business on the date or dates upon which this Warrant is exercised.

^^Stock Certificates. In the event of any exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, as promptly as practicable after this Warrant is surrendered and delivered to the Company along with all other appropriate documentation on or after the date of exercise and in any event within ten (10) days thereafter, the Company at its expense shall issue and deliver to the person or persons entitled to receive the same a certificate or certificates for the number of Shares issuable upon such exercise. In the event this Warrant is exercised in part, the Company at its expense will execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor exercisable for the number of Shares for which this Warrant may then be exercised.

^^Taxes. The issuance of the Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, and the delivery of certificates or other instruments representing such Shares, shall be made without charge to the Holder for any tax or other charge in respect of such issuance.

^**Warrant**.  

^^Transfer and Replacement. At any time prior to the exercise hereof, this Warrant may be exchanged upon presentation and surrender to the Company, alone or with other warrants of like tenor of different denominations registered in the name of the same Holder, for another warrant or warrants of like tenor in the name of such Holder exercisable for the aggregate number of Shares as the warrant or warrants surrendered.

^^Replacement of Warrant. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft, or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company, at its expense, will execute and deliver in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.

^^Cancellation. Payment of Expenses. Upon the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer, exchange or replacement as provided in this Section 2, this Warrant shall be promptly canceled by the Company. The Holder shall pay all taxes and all other expenses (including legal expenses, if any, incurred by the Holder or transferees) and charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.

^^Warrant Register. The Company shall maintain, at its principal executive offices (or at the offices of the transfer agent for the Warrant or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the holder hereof), a register for this Warrant (the “**Warrant Register**”), in which the Company shall record the name and address of the person in whose name this Warrant has been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee and each prior owner of this Warrant.

^**Rights and Obligations of Holders of this Warrant**.

The Holder of this Warrant shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any rights of a shareholder in the Company, either at law or in equity; provided, however, that in the event any certificate representing shares of Common Stock or other securities is issued to the holder hereof upon exercise of this Warrant, such holder shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Common Stock on the date on which this Warrant, together with a duly executed Notice of Exercise, was surrendered and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such Common Stock certificate.

^**Adjustments**.  

^^Stock Dividends, Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, Etc. While this Warrant is outstanding, in the event the Company: (i) pays a dividend in Common Stock or makes a distribution in Common Stock, (ii) subdivides its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (iii) combines its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) increases or decreases the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding by reclassification of its Common Stock (including a recapitalization in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation), then (1) the Exercise Price on the record date of such division or distribution or the effective date of such action shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant may be exercised immediately before such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Exercise Price immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the Exercise Price immediately after such event.

^^Combination: Liquidation. While this Warrant is outstanding, (i) In the event of a Combination (as defined below), each Holder shall have the right to receive upon exercise of the Warrant the kind and amount of shares of capital stock or other securities or property which such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon or as a result of such Combination had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such event (subject to further adjustment in accordance with the terms hereof). Unless paragraph (ii) is applicable to a Combination, the Company shall provide that the surviving or acquiring Person (as defined below) (the “S**uccessor Company**”) in such Combination will assume by written instrument the obligations under this Section 4 and the obligations to deliver to the Holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Holder may be entitled to acquire. “**Combination**” means an event in which the Company consolidates with, mergers with or into, or sells all or substantially all of its assets to another Person, where “**Person**” means any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, association, joint-stock company, trust, un[[Party 1]] organization, government or any agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity; (ii) In the event of (x) a Combination where consideration to the holders of Common Stock in exchange for their shares is payable solely in cash or (y) the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the Holders shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of their Warrant, distributions on an equal basis with the holders of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrant, as if the Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such event, less the Exercise Price. In case of any Combination described in this Section 4, the surviving or acquiring Person and, in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the Company, shall deposit promptly with an agent or trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the funds, if any, necessary to pay to the Holders the amounts to which they are entitled as described above. After such funds and the surrendered Warrant are received, the Company is required to deliver a check in such amount as is appropriate (or, in the case or consideration other than cash, such other consideration as is appropriate) to such Person or Persons as it may be directed in writing by the Holders surrendering such Warrant.

^^Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock and other property, if any, issuable upon exercise of the Warrant is adjusted, as provided in this Section 4, the Company shall deliver to the holders of the Warrant in accordance with Section 10 a certificate of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of the basis on which (i) the Board of Directors determined the fair value of any evidences of indebtedness, other securities or property or warrants, options or other subscription or purchase rights and (ii) the Current Market Value (as defined below) of the Common Stock was determined, if either of such determinations were required), and specifying the Exercise Price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant after giving effect to such adjustment.

^^Notice of Certain Transactions. While this Warrant is outstanding, in the event that the Company shall propose (a) to pay any dividend payable in securities of any class to the holders of its Common Stock or to make any other non-cash dividend or distribution to the holders of its Common Stock, (b) to offer the holders of its Common Stock rights to subscribe for or to purchase any securities convertible into shares of Common Stock or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (c) to effect any capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger affecting the class of Common Stock, as a whole, or (d) to effect the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, the Company shall, within the time limits specified below, send to each Holder a notice of such proposed action or offer. Such notice shall be mailed to the Holders at their addresses as they appear in the Warrant Register, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such dividend, distribution or rights, or the date such issuance or event is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of Common Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and shall briefly indicate the effect of such action on the Common Stock and on the number and kind of any other shares of stock and on other property, if any, and the number of shares of Common Stock and other property, if any, issuable upon exercise of each Warrant and the Exercise Price after giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 4 which will be required as a result of such action. Such notice shall be given as promptly as possible and (x) in the case of any action covered by clause (a) or (b) above, at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Common Stock for purposes of such action or (y) in the case of any other such action, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of Common Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.

^^Current Market Value. The “**Current Market Value**” per share of Common Stock or any other security at any date means (i) if the security is not registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “**Exchange Act**”) and/or traded on a national securities exchange, quotation system or bulletin board, (a) the value of the security, determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company and certified in a board resolution, based on the most recently completed arm’s-length transaction between the Company and a Person other than an affiliate of the Company or between any two such Persons and the closing of which occurs on such date or shall have occurred within the six-month period preceding such date, or (b) if no such transaction shall have occurred within the six-month period, the value of the security as determined by an independent financial expert or an agreed upon financial valuation model or (ii) if the security is registered under the Exchange Act and/or traded on a national securities exchange, quotation system or bulletin board, the average of the daily closing bid prices (or the equivalent in an over-the-counter market) for each day on which the Common Stock is traded for any period on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the common Stock is being traded (each, a “**Trading Day**”) during the period commencing thirty (30) days before such date and ending on the date one (1) day prior to such date.

^**Fractional Shares**.   
In lieu of issuance of a fractional share upon any exercise hereunder, the Company will issue an additional whole share in lieu of that fractional share, calculated on the basis of the Exercise Price.

^**Legends**.   
Prior to issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying this Warrant, all such certificates representing such shares shall bear a restrictive legend to the effect that the Shares represented by such certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “**Securities Act**”), and that the Shares may not be sold or transferred in the absence of such registration or an exemption therefrom, such legend to be substantially in the form of the bold-face language appearing at the top of Page 1 of this Warrant.
