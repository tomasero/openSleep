\centered **U.S. PENSION PLAN SPIN-OFF** 

Section 5.01  General Principle. Effective on or before the Distribution Date, DPSG shall establish and adopt a defined benefit pension benefit plan and trust (the “**DPSG Pension Plan**”) intended to be qualified under IRS Code Section 401(a) and containing provisions that will provide to each DPSG Business Employee and Former DPSG Employee (and each alternate payee or beneficiary of such person) (the “**DPSG Pension Beneficiaries**”) benefits identical to those accrued with respect to such person under the Cadbury Pension Plan as of [[Date 5: Date]] (the “**Pension Measurement Date**”). On or before the Distribution Date, Cadbury shall (i) determine the Initial Transfer Amount (as defined below) and (ii) cause assets equal to the Initial Transfer Amount (adjusted as provided below) to be transferred to the trust under the DPSG Pension Plan in the form described below (the “**Initial Transfer**”). As of the date of such transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount (the “**Initial Transfer Date**”), DPSG shall commence making the required benefit payments under the terms of the DPSG Pension Plan and shall assume all liabilities with respect to the payment of benefits previously accrued by the DPSG Pension Beneficiaries under the Cadbury Pension Plan. A DPSG Business Employee shall not accrue benefits under the Cadbury Pension Plan after the date on which such employee becomes eligible to participate under the DPSG Pension Plan, unless such DPSG Pension Beneficiary shall become employed by Cadbury or a Cadbury Subsidiary after such date. A Cadbury Business Employee shall not accrue benefits under the DPSG Pension Plan, unless such Cadbury Business Employee shall become employed by DPSG or a DPSG Subsidiary. Following the Initial Transfer Date (i) an enrolled actuary appointed by Cadbury (the “**Cadbury Actuary**”) shall determine the Final Pension Transfer Amount (as defined below) and (ii) a True-Up Adjustment shall be made with respect to the Cadbury Pension Plan and the DPSG Pension Plan, as provided below. The Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause the determination of the Final Pension Transfer Amount and the True-Up Adjustment to be completed as reasonably promptly as practicable, subject to the time frames established under Section 5.03, but in no event later than [[Date 6: Date]]. Before or promptly after the date hereof, Cadbury and DPSG shall file requests with the IRS for qualification determination letters under IRS Code Section 401(a) with respect to the Cadbury Pension Plan and the DPSG Pension Plan and shall take any and all reasonable action, including the adoption of any amendments requested by the IRS, as shall be necessary to obtain such determination letters. The transfers hereunder shall occur prior to, but subject to the subsequent receipt of, favorable determination letters issued by the IRS with respect to the Cadbury Pension Plan and DPSG Pension Plan, copies of which shall be shared among Cadbury and DPSG promptly upon issuance. 

Section 5.02  Determination and Transfer of Initial Transfer Amount. On or before the Distribution Date, with the assistance of the Cadbury Actuary, Cadbury shall establish and communicate to DPSG the amount equal to [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the estimated asset transfer amount calculated as of [[Date 7: Date]] in accordance with IRS Code Section 414(l) but based on [[Date 8: Date]] census data and [[Date 9: Date]] trust assets as attributable to benefits accrued by DPSG Pension Beneficiaries under the Cadbury Pension Plan as of the Pension Measurement Date, adjusted for contributions, distributions, trust gains and losses, payments and other appropriate items occurring between the Pension Measurement Date and the Initial Transfer Date, all as estimated in good faith by Cadbury (the “**Initial Transfer Amount**”). 

^^^^^ 
Following the determination of the Initial Transfer Amount by Cadbury, Cadbury shall cause to be transferred from the trust under the Cadbury Pension Plan to the trust under the DPSG Pension Plan assets having an aggregate Value (as defined below) equal to the Initial Transfer Amount. Such assets shall be in the form of cash, securities and other property, determined in accordance with the provisions below. 

Section 5.03  Determination of the Final Pension Transfer Amount. 

^^Calculation of the Cadbury Actuary. Following the Distribution Date, the Cadbury Actuary shall determine the Final Pension Transfer Amount, which shall be equal to the amount required to be transferred from the Cadbury Pension Plan to the DPSG Pension Plan in respect of the assumption by the DPSG Pension Plan of the benefit obligations of the Cadbury Pension Plan of benefits accrued by the DPSG Pension Beneficiaries as of the Pension Measurement Date, as determined in accordance with IRS Code Section 414(l) and the regulations thereunder and the actuarial assumptions and methods set forth in Schedule 6.03 hereof, as appropriately adjusted to reflect the following amounts arising after the Pension Measurement Date and before the True-Up Adjustment: (A) any distributions and contributions made in respect of the DPSG Pension Beneficiaries, (B) administrative expenses of the Cadbury Pension Plan reasonably allocable to the DPSG Pension Beneficiaries, (C) earnings realized by the Cadbury Pension Plan allocable to the DPSG Pension Beneficiaries, (D) the net gain or loss (realized and unrealized) of the Cadbury Pension Plan allocable to the DPSG Pension Beneficiaries and (E) other appropriate items. Cadbury and DPSG shall each be responsible for the funding of their respective pension plans. It is anticipated that each pension plan will have underfunding under ERISA Section 4044. Each party shall be responsible for funding such underfunding under their respective pension plan. Promptly upon determination of the Final Pension Transfer Amount, Cadbury shall cause the Cadbury Actuary to provide to DPSG a written statement of the Final Pension Transfer Amount, a summary of the calculation of such amount (the “**Pension Statement**”) and a written statement that the sum of the Initial Transfer Amount and the Final Pension Transfer Amount satisfies the requirements of IRS Code Section 414(l). 

^^Resolution of Differences. Cadbury shall provide DPSG with all information reasonably necessary to review the calculation of the Final Pension Transfer Amount in all material respects and to verify that such calculations have been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The determination of the Final Pension Transfer Amount by the Cadbury Actuary shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes under this Agreement, unless DPSG provides to Cadbury, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Pension Statement, a written objection prepared by an enrolled actuary retained by DPSG setting forth in detail a reasonable basis for the conclusion that the Final Pension Transfer Amount set forth in the Pension Statement is understated by an amount in excess of [[Percentage 2: Number]]%. Upon receipt of such objection, Cadbury and DPSG shall make a good faith attempt to resolve their dispute as to the Final Pension Transfer Amount. Should such dispute remain unresolved for more than thirty (30) days, Cadbury and DPSG shall promptly select and appoint a third enrolled actuary who is mutually satisfactory to both Parties. The third actuary shall recalculate the Final Pension Transfer Amount and if such recalculated amount exceeds the Final Pension Transfer Amount set forth in the Pension Statement by more than [[Percentage 2]]%, then such recalculated amount shall serve as the Final Pension Transfer Amount for all purposes under this Agreement. If such recalculated 

^^^^^ 
amount does not exceed the Final Pension Transfer Amount set forth in the Pension Statement by more than [[Percentage 2]]%, then for all purposes under this Agreement the Final Pension Transfer Amount shall be the Final Pension Transfer Amount as set forth in the Pension Statement. The recalculation of such third party actuary shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the retention of such third party actuary and shall be conclusive as to any dispute with respect to the Final Pension Transfer Amount, except as set forth in Section 5.05 below. The cost of such third party actuary shall be divided equally between Cadbury and DPSG. Each Party shall be responsible for the cost of its own actuary. 

Section 5.04  True-Up Adjustment. The following transfer shall be made promptly after the date that the Final Pension Transfer Amount is determined as set forth above: (A) if the Final Pension Transfer Amount exceeds the Initial Transfer Amount, Cadbury shall promptly cause to be transferred from the Cadbury Pension Plan trust to the DPSG Pension Plan trust assets having a Value equal to such excess and (B) if the Initial Transfer Amount exceeds the Final Pension Transfer Amount, DPSG shall promptly cause to be transferred from the DPSG Pension Plan trust to the Cadbury Pension Plan trust assets having a Value equal to such excess. 

Section 5.05  Form and Selection of Assets to be Transferred. The assets to be transferred in the Initial Transfer and the True-Up Adjustment Assets will be transferred in-kind or in cash pro rata from each investment manager under the transferring plan in a manner that represents, as closely as commercially practical, a pro rata portion of each asset and position held by the manager as of the date of such transfer, except that reasonable adjustments shall be made where Cadbury determines such transfers cannot reasonably be made by the Cadbury Pension Plan due to investment manager account minimums or where other considerations prevent such pro rata transfers or render such pro rata transfers impractical. For purposes of the Agreement, the "**Value**” of all pension assets shall be the value of such assets as determined in good faith by Cadbury based on all relevant information known to Cadbury at the time of such determination, including the most recent account statements or schedules of asset values provided to Cadbury by any service providers maintaining or overseeing any such assets or any investment vehicles which represent or hold the relevant plan assets. Cadbury shall select the assets to be transferred and provide a schedule of such assets to DPSG 14 days prior to the transfer of such assets. DPSG shall communicate to Cadbury any objection to the schedule of the assets to be transferred promptly, and upon receipt by Cadbury of such objection, Cadbury and DPSG shall make a good faith attempt to resolve their dispute as to the assets to be transferred within the period remaining prior to the transfer of the assets. Should such dispute remain unresolved upon the asset transfer date, the assets shall be transferred in accordance with the schedule provided by Cadbury. Any assets that are liquidated prior to transfer shall be reduced by the asset liquidation expenses actually incurred. 

\centered **U.S. 401(K) PLAN**

The transfer shall be an in-kind transfer, subject to the reasonable consent of the trustee of the DPSG 401(k) Plan and shall include the transfer of the aggregate assets held in the accounts relating to each DPSG DC Plan Beneficiary under the Cadbury 401(k) Plan and any participant loan notes held under such plans. Any assets that are liquidated prior to transfer shall be reduced by the asset liquidation expenses, such as commissions or early withdrawal penalties, actually incurred. Cadbury shall cause the DPSG 401(k) Plan to allocate the portion of any forfeiture account under the Cadbury 401(k) Plan that relates to forfeiture by Former DPSG Employees consistent with Cadbury’s past practice regarding allocation of forfeitures under the Cadbury 401(k) Plan. Before or promptly after the date hereof, Cadbury and DPSG shall file requests with the IRS for qualification determination letters under IRS Code Section 401(a) and 401(k) (as applicable) with respect to the Cadbury 401(k) Plan and DPSG 401(k) Plan and shall take any and all reasonable actions, including the adoption of amendments requested by the IRS, as shall be necessary to obtain such determination letters. The transfers under this Section 6.02 shall occur prior to, but subject to the subsequent receipt of favorable determination letters issued by the IRS with respect to the Cadbury 401(k) Plan and DPSG 401(k) Plan, copies of which shall be shared among Cadbury and DPSG promptly upon issuance. 

Section 6.03  Funding of 2008 Matching Contribution. DPSG shall fund and allocate the full amount of any 2008 matching contribution accrued under the terms of the Cadbury 401(k) Plan to eligible DPSG DC Plan Beneficiaries under the DPSG 401(k) Plan within the time permitted by law (determined based on the terms of the Cadbury 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the transfer to the DPSG 401(k) Plan as if the transfer to the DPSG 401(k) Plan did not occur, but paid and contributed by DPSG to the DPSG 401(k) Plan).
