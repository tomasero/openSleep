[[Date 1: Date]]  
This document is in reference to the Promissory Note dated and signed on [[Date 2: Date]], 2C08 between [[Organization 1 Name]], with the new address of 8245 SE 36th St., [[Address 1: Address]] (address on note was 16S04 9th Ave SE, Suite 205, Mill Creek, WA 98041) and [[Party 1]], residing at 2708 E [[Party 2]], WA 98112.

The note was originally set to expire and be paid on [[Date 3: Date]].

It has been mutually agreed upon that said note in the principal amount of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] will have the term expended for period of up to two additional years, with Mr. Landerholm having the right to call the loan with a 30 day notice. All other terms within the note document will remain the same.

The new expiration date of the note therefore will be [[Date 4: Date]], given Mr. Landerholm does not call the note prior to expiration.
