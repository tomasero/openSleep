**Stamp Duties and Taxes**

^^**Stamp Duties:** The Issuer will pay any stamp, issue, documentary or other taxes and duties, including interest and penalties, payable in Belgium, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom in respect of the creation, issue and offering of the Notes and the Coupons and the execution or delivery of this Trust Deed.

^^**Change of Taxing Jurisdiction:** If the Issuer becomes subject generally to the taxing jurisdiction of a territory or a taxing authority of or in that territory with power to tax other than or in addition to the United Kingdom or any such authority of or in such territory then the Issuer will (unless the Trustee otherwise agrees) give the Trustee an undertaking satisfactory to the Trustee in terms corresponding to the terms of Condition 7 with the substitution for, or (as the case may require) the addition to, the references in that Condition to the United Kingdom of references to that other or additional territory or authority to whose taxing jurisdiction the Issuer has become so subject. In such event this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons will be read accordingly.

**Application of Moneys Received by the Trustee**

^^**Declaration of Trust:** All moneys received by the Trustee in respect of the Notes or amounts payable under this Trust Deed will, despite any appropriation of all or part of them by the Issuer, be held by the Trustee on trust to apply them (subject to Clause 5.2):

**5.1.1**   first, in payment of all costs, fees, charges, expenses and liabilities properly incurred by the Trustee (including remuneration payable to it) in carrying out its functions under this Trust Deed;

**5.1.2**   secondly, in payment of any amounts owing in respect of the Notes or Coupons pari passu and rateably; and

**5.1.3**   thirdly, in payment of any balance to the Issuer for itself.

If the Trustee holds any moneys in respect of Notes or Coupons which have become void, the Trustee will hold them on these trusts.

^^**Accumulation:** If the amount of the moneys at any time available for payment in respect of the Notes under Clause 5.1 is less than 10 per cent. of the nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding, the Trustee may, at its discretion, invest such moneys. The Trustee may retain such investments and accumulate the resulting income until the investments and the accumulations, together with any other funds for the time being under its control and available for such payment, amount to at least 10 per cent. of the nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding and then such investments, accumulations and funds (after deduction of, or provision for, any applicable taxes) will be applied as specified in Clause 5.1.

^^**Investment:** Moneys held by the Trustee may be invested in its name or under its control in any investments or other assets anywhere whether or not they produce income or deposited in its name or under its control at such bank or other financial institution in such currency as the Trustee may, in its absolute discretion, think fit. If that bank or institution is the Trustee or a subsidiary, holding or associated company of the Trustee, it need only account for an amount of interest equal to the standard amount of interest payable by it on such a deposit to an independent customer. The Trustee may at any time vary or transpose any such investments or assets or convert any moneys so deposited into any other currency, and will not be responsible for any resulting loss, whether by depreciation in value, change in exchange rates or otherwise.

^^**Regulated Activities**: Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Deed to the contrary, the Trustee shall not do, or be authorised or required to do, anything which might constitute a regulated activity for the purpose of the FSMA, unless it is authorised under the FSMA to do so. The Trustee shall have the discretion at any time (i) to delegate any of the functions which fall to be performed by an authorised person under the FSMA to any agent or person which has the necessary authorisations and licences and (ii) to apply for authorisation under the FSMA and perform any or all such functions itself if, in its absolute discretion, it considers it necessary, desirable or appropriate to do so.

^^**Expenses:** The Issuer will also on demand by the Trustee pay or discharge all costs, charges, liabilities and expenses properly incurred by the Trustee in the preparation and execution of this Trust Deed and the performance of its functions under this Trust Deed including, but not limited to, legal and travelling expenses and any stamp, documentary or other taxes or duties paid by the Trustee in connection with any legal proceedings reasonably brought or contemplated by the Trustee against the Issuer to enforce any provision of this Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons. Such costs, charges, liabilities and expenses will:

**7.3.1**   in the case of payments made by the Trustee before such demand carry interest from the date of the demand at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum over the base rate of [[Organization 7 Name]] on the date on which the Trustee made such payments and

**7.3.2**   in other cases carry interest at such rate from 30 days after the date of the demand or (where the demand specifies that payment is to be made on an earlier date) from such earlier date.

^^**Indemnity:** The Issuer will on demand by the Trustee indemnify it in respect of Amounts or Claims paid or incurred by it in acting as trustee under this Trust Deed (including (1) any Agent/Delegate Liabilities and (2) in respect of disputing or defending any Amounts or Claims made against the Trustee or any Agent/Delegate Liabilities). The Issuer will on demand by such agent or delegate indemnify it against such Agent/Delegate Liabilities. “**Amounts or Claims**” are losses, liabilities, costs, fees, claims, actions, demands or expenses (together in each case, with any applicable value added or other taxes in respect thereof) and “**Agent/Delegate Liabilities**” are Amounts or Claims which the Trustee is or would be obliged to pay or reimburse to any of its agents or delegates appointed pursuant to this Trust Deed.

^^Notwithstanding any provision of this Trust Deed to the contrary, the Trustee shall not in any event be liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits, goodwill, reputation, business opportunity or anticipated saving), whether or not foreseeable, even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of whether the claim for loss or damage is made in negligence, for breach of contract, breach of trust or otherwise.

^^**Continuing Effect:** Clauses 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 will continue in full force and effect as regards the Trustee even if it no longer is Trustee.

^^**No set-off etc**: The Issuer hereby further undertakes to the Trustee that all moneys payable by the Issuer to the Trustee shall be made without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding unless compelled by law in which event the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by the Trustee of the amounts which would otherwise have been payable by the Issuer to the Trustee in the absence of any such set off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding.

**Provisions Supplemental to the Trustee Act 1925 and the Trustee Act 2000**

^of the Trustee Act 2000 shall not apply to this Trust Deed. Where there are any inconsistencies between the Trustee Act 1925 and the Trustee Act 2000 and the provisions of this Trust Deed, the provisions of this Trust Deed shall, to the extent allowed by law, prevail and, in the case of any inconsistency with the Trustee Act 2000, the provisions of this Trust Deed shall constitute a restriction or exclusion for the purposes of that Act. By way of supplement to the Trustee Act 1925 and the Trustee Act 2000, it is expressly declared as follows:

^^**Resolutions of Noteholders:** The Trustee will not be responsible for having acted in good faith on a resolution purporting to have been passed at a meeting of Noteholders in respect of which minutes have been made and signed or any written resolution even if it is later found that there was a defect in the constitution of the meeting or the passing of the resolution or in the case of a written resolution or direction or request, it was not signed by the requisite number of Noteholders or that for any reason that the resolution, direction or request was not valid or binding on the Noteholders or Couponholders.

^^**Certificate signed by Authorised Signatories:** If the Trustee, in the exercise of its functions, requires to be satisfied or to have information as to any fact or the expediency of any act, it may call for and accept as sufficient evidence of that fact or the expediency of that act a certificate signed by any two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer as to that fact or to the effect that, in their opinion, that act is expedient and the Trustee need not call for further evidence and will not be responsible for any loss occasioned by acting on such a certificate. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any certificate of two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer where the Issuer procures the delivery of the same pursuant to its obligations to do so under the Conditions or this Trust Deed and such certificate shall be binding on the Issuer, the Trustee and the N oteholders.

^^**Report of the Auditors:** The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any certificate or report of the Auditors whether or not such report is addressed to the Trustee and notwithstanding that such report and/or any engagement letter or other document entered into by the Trustee contains a monetary or other limit on the liability of the Auditors.

^^**Delegation:** Whenever it considers it expedient in the interests of the Noteholders, the Trustee may delegate to any person on any terms (including power to sub-delegate) all or any of its functions.

^^**Nominees:** In relation to any asset held by it under this Trust Deed, the Trustee may appoint any person to act as its nominee on any terms.

^^**Forged Notes:** The Trustee will not be liable to the Issuer or any Noteholder or Couponholder by reason of having accepted as valid or not having rejected any Note or Coupon purporting to be such and later found to be forged or not authentic.

^^**Confidentiality:** Unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction the Trustee shall not be required to disclose to any Noteholder or Couponholder any confidential financial or other information made available to the Trustee by the Issuer and no Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to take any action to obtain such information from the Trustee.

^^**Determinations Conclusive:** As between itself and the Noteholders and Couponholders the Trustee may in its absolute discretion determine all questions and doubts arising in relation to any of the provisions of this Trust Deed including (without limitation) determination of whether or not a default in performance by the Issuer of any obligation under the Notes or Trust Deed is materially prejudicial to the interests of Noteholders and Couponholders. Such determinations, whether made upon such a question actually raised or implied in the acts or proceedings of the Trustee, will be conclusive and shall bind the Trustee, the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

^^**Currency Conversion:** Where it is necessary or desirable to convert any sum from one currency to another, it will (unless otherwise provided hereby or required by law) be converted at such rate or rates, in accordance with such method and as at such date as may reasonably be specified by the Trustee but having regard to current rates of exchange, if available. Any rate, method and date so specified will be binding on the Issuer, the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

^^**Events of Default etc.:** The Trustee may determine whether or not an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is in its opinion capable of remedy and/or materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders. Any such determination will be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

^^**Payment for and Delivery of Notes:** The Trustee will not be responsible for the receipt or application by the Issuer of the proceeds of the issue of the Notes, any exchange of Notes or the delivery of Notes to the persons entitled to them.

^^**Notes held by the Issuer etc.:** In the absence of knowledge or express notice to the contrary, the Trustee may assume without enquiry (other than requesting a certificate under Clause 6.12) that no Notes are for the time being held by or on behalf of the Issuer or its affiliates.

^^**Responsibility for agents etc.:** If the Trustee exercises reasonable care in selecting any custodian, agent, delegate or nominee appointed under this clause (an “**Appointee**”), it will not have any obligation to supervise the Appointee or be responsible for any loss, liability, cost, claim, action, demand or expense incurred by reason of the Appointee’s misconduct or default or the misconduct or default of any substitute appointed by the Appointee.

^^**Responsibility for Rating:** The Trustee shall (a) have no responsibility for the maintenance of any rating of the Notes by any Rating Agency and (b) shall not be liable to Noteholders if any exercise by it of its trusts, powers and discretions results in a change to the rating assigned by any Rating Agency to any class of Notes.

^^**No Liability for error of judgement:** The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgement made in good faith by any officer and/or employee of the Trustee in the administration of its corporate matters.

^^**Clearing Systems:** The Trustee may call for any certificate or other document to be issued by Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other clearing system through which the Notes are cleared as to the principal amount of Notes represented by a Global Note standing to the account of any person and may have regard to any information provided to it by Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or such other clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of any of their accountholders with entitlements to such Global Note, and the Trustee may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of any such Global Note. Any such certificate, document or information may be accepted and fully relied upon by the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be liable to any person by reason of having accepted as valid or accurate or not having rej ected any certificate, document or information to such effect purporting to be issued by Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or such other clearing system and subsequently found to be forged, not authentic or inaccurate.

^^**Legal Opinions:** The Trustee shall not be responsible to any person for failing to request, require or receive any legal opinion relating to the Notes or for checking or commenting upon the content of any such legal opinion and shall not be responsible for any loss, damage, cost, charge, claim, demand, expense, judgment, action, proceeding or other liability whatsoever incurred thereby.

^^**No Action:**

**8.23.1**   The Trustee shall not be bound to take any action in connection with this Trust Deed or any obligations arising pursuant thereto, including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, forming any opinion or employing any financial adviser, where it is not satisfied that the Issuer will be able to indemnify and/or secure and/or prefund it against all loss, damage, cost, charge, claim, demand, expense, judgment, action, proceeding or other liability whatsoever incurred thereby which may be incurred in connection with such action and may demand prior to taking any such action that there be paid to it in advance such sums as it reasonably considers (without prejudice to any further demand) shall be sufficient so to indemnify it and on such demand being made the Issuer shall be obliged to make payment of all such sums in full.

**8.23.2**   No provision of this Trust Deed shall require the Trustee to do anything which may (i) be illegal or contrary to applicable law or regulation; or (ii) cause it to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any loss, damage, cost, charge, claim, demand, expense, judgment, action, proceeding or other liability whatsoever incurred thereby in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights, powers or discretions, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or loss, damage, cost, charge, claim, demand, expense, judgment, action, proceeding or other liability whatsoever is not assured to it.

^^**Professional and other charges**: Any trustee of the trust presents being a lawyer, accountant, broker or other person engaged in any profession or business shall be entitled to charge and be paid all usual and proper professional and other charges for business transacted and acts done by him or his firm in connection with the trusts of this Trust Deed or the Paying Agency Agreement and also his properly incurred charges in addition to disbursements for all other work and business done and all time spent by him or his firm in connection with matters arising in connection with this Trust Deed including matters which might or should have been attended to in person by a trustee not being a banker, accountant or other professional person.

^^**Holder Absolute Owner**: The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws) deem and treat the bearer of any Note or Coupon as the absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not the Note or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing on the Note or Coupon or any notice of previous loss or theft of the Note or Coupon or of any trust or interest therein) and shall not be required to obtain any proof thereof or as to the identity of such bearer.

^^**Enforcement**: The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons, but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons unless it has been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-quarter in outstanding nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Nor shall the Trustee be bound to take or omit to take any step or action (including such proceedings) unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction in respect of all costs, claims, expenses and liabilities to or for which it may, in its opinion, thereby become liable. No Notehol der or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.

^^**Responsibility for loss**: The Trustee shall not be liable or responsible for any losses, damages, costs or fees, charges, claims, demands or expenses or inconvenience which may result from anything done or omitted to be done by it in accordance with the provisions this Trust Deed.

^^**Not responsible for statements**: The Trustee shall not be responsible for, or for investigating any matter which is the subject of, any recital, statement, representation, warranty or covenant of any person contained in this Trust Deed, or any other agreement or document relating to the transactions contemplated in this Trust Deed or under such other agreement or document.

The Trustee may give any consent or approval, exercise any power, authority or discretion or take any similar action (whether or not such consent, approval, power, authority, discretion or action is specifically referred to in these presents) if it is satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not have any duty to the Noteholders in relation to such matters other than that which is contained in the preceding sentence.

^^**Exercise by Trustee of discretions etc.**: In connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers, authorities and discretions under these presents (including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class and shall not have regard to any interests arising from circumstances particular to individual Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have regard to the consequences of any such exercise for individual Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory or any political sub division thereof and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder or Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 7 and/or any undertaking given in addition thereto or in substitution therefor under this Trust Deed.

^^**Reliance on Rating Agency Confirmation**: For the purposes of determining whether or not the exercise by the Trustee of any of its trusts, powers, authorities, duties and discretions under this Trust Deed (including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution), is materially prejudicial to the interest of the Noteholders the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on (but is not bound by) written confirmation received from any Rating Agency received in respect thereof.

**Trustee Liable for Negligence**

^of the Trustee Act 2000 shall not apply to any function of the Trustee, provided that if the Trustee fails to show the degree of care and diligence required of it as trustee, nothing in this Trust Deed shall relieve or indemnify it from or against any liability which would otherwise attach to it in respect of any breach of trust of which it may be guilty.

**Waiver and Proof of Default**

^^**Waiver:** The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders and without prejudice to its rights in respect of any subsequent breach, from time to time and at any time, if in its opinion the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced thereby, waive or authorise, on such terms as seem expedient to it, any breach or proposed breach by the Issuer of this Trust Deed or the Conditions or determine that an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default, Restructuring Event or Potential Restructuring Event will not be treated as such provided that the Trustee will not do so in contravention of an express direction given by an Extraordinary Resolution or a request made pursuant to Condition 9. No such direction or request will affect a previous waiver, authorisation or determination. Any such waiver, authorisation or determinat ion will be binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and, if the Trustee so requires, will be notified to the Noteholders as soon as practicable.

^^**Proof of Default:** Proof that the Issuer has failed to pay a sum due to the holder of any one Note or Coupon will (unless the contrary be proved) be sufficient evidence that it has made the same default as regards all other Notes or Coupons which are then payable.

**Trustee not Precluded from Entering into Contracts**

The Trustee and any other person, whether or not acting for itself, may acquire, hold or dispose of any Note, Coupon or other security (or any interest therein) of the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or any other person, may enter into or be interested in any contract or transaction with any such person and may act on, or as trustee, depositary or agent for, any committee or body of holders of any securities issued or guaranteed by or relating to any such person in each case with the same rights as it would have had if the Trustee were not acting as Trustee and need not account for any profit or for any amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**Modification and Substitution**

^^**Modification:** The Trustee may agree without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders to any modification to this Trust Deed which is, in its opinion, of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct a manifest error. The Trustee may also agree to any modification to this Trust Deed which is in its opinion not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders, but such power does not extend to any such modification as is mentioned in the proviso to paragraph 2 of Schedule 3.

^^**Substitution:**

**12.2.1**   The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree to the substitution of the Issuer’s successor in business or any Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) (the “**Substituted Obligor**”) in place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this sub-Clause) as the principal debtor under this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons provided that:

^^^a deed is executed or undertaking given by the Substituted Obligor to the Trustee, in form and manner satisfactory to the Trustee, agreeing to be bound by this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons (with consequential amendments as the Trustee may deem appropriate) as if the Substituted Obligor had been named in this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons as the principal debtor in place of the Issuer

^^^if the Substituted Obligor is subject generally to the taxing jurisdiction of a territory or any authority of or in that territory with power to tax (the “**Substituted Territory**”) other than the territory to the taxing jurisdiction of which (or to any such authority of or in which) the Issuer is subject generally (the “**Issuer’s Territory**”), the Substituted Obligor will (unless the Trustee otherwise agrees) give to the Trustee an undertaking satisfactory to the Trustee in terms corresponding to Condition 7 with the substitution for the references in that Condition to the Issuer’s Territory of references to the Substituted Territory whereupon the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons will be read accordingly

^^^if any two Authorised Signatories of the Substituted Obligor certify that it will be solvent immediately after such substitution, the Trustee need not have regard to the Substituted Obligor’s financial condition, profits or prospects or compare them with those of the Issuer

^^^the Trustee is satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution

^^^the Issuer and the Substituted Obligor comply with such other requirements as the Trustee may direct in the interests of the Noteholders and

^^^(unless the Issuer’s successor in business is the Substituted Obligor as the principal debtor under this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons) the obligations of the Substituted Obligor as the principal debtor under this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons are guaranteed by the Issuer (with consequential amendments as necessary) to the Trustee’s satisfaction.

**12.2.2**   **Release of Substituted Issuer:** An agreement by the Trustee pursuant to this Clause 12.2 will, if so expressed, release the Issuer (or a previous substitute) from any or all of its obligations under this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons. Notice of the substitution will be given to the Noteholders within 14 days of the execution of such documents and compliance with such requirements.

**12.2.3**   **Completion of Substitution:** On completion of the formalities set out in this Clause 12.2, the Substituted Obligor will be deemed to be named in this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons as the principal debtor in place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute) and this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons will be deemed to be amended as necessary to give effect to the substitution.

**Appointment, Retirement and Removal of the Trustee**

^^**Appointment:** Subject as provided in Clause 13.2 below, the Issuer has the power of appointing new trustees but no-one may be so appointed unless previously approved by an Extraordinary Resolution. A trust corporation will at all times be a Trustee and may be the sole Trustee. Any appointment of a new Trustee will be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable.

^^**Retirement and Removal:** Any Trustee may retire at any time on giving at least three months’ written notice to the Issuer without giving any reason or being responsible for any costs occasioned by such retirement and the Noteholders may by Extraordinary Resolution remove any Trustee provided that the retirement or removal of a sole trust corporation will not be effective until a trust corporation is appointed as successor Trustee. If a sole trust corporation gives notice of retirement or an Extraordinary Resolution is passed for its removal, the Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to procure that another trust corporation be appointed as Trustee and if it does not procure the appointment of a new trustee within 30 days of the expiry of the Trustee’s notice referred to in this Clause, the Trustee shall be entitled to procure forthwith a new trustee.

^^**Co-Trustees:** The Trustee may, despite Clause 13.1, by written notice to the Issuer appoint anyone to act as an additional Trustee jointly with the Trustee:

**13.3.1**   if the Trustee considers the appointment to be in the interests of the Noteholders and/or the Couponholders

**13.3.2**   to conform with a legal requirement, restriction or condition in a jurisdiction in which a particular act is to be performed or

**13.3.3**   to obtain a judgment or to enforce a judgment or any provision of this Trust Deed in any jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of this Trust Deed the Trustee may confer on any person so appointed such functions as it thinks fit. The Trustee may by written notice to the Issuer and that person remove that person. At the Trustee’s request, the Issuer will forthwith do all things as may be required to perfect such appointment or removal and it irrevocably appoints the Trustee as its attorney in its name and on its behalf to do so.

^^**Competence of a Majority of Trustees:** If there are more than two Trustees the majority of them will be competent to perform the Trustee’s functions provided the majority includes a trust corporation.

^^**Merger:** Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Clause, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto.

**Couponholders**

No notices need be given to Couponholders. They will be deemed to have notice of the contents of any notice given to Noteholders. Even if it has express notice to the contrary, in exercising any of its functions by reference to the interests of the Noteholders, the Trustee will assume that the holder of each Note is the holder of all Coupons relating to it.

**Currency Indemnity**

^^**Currency of Account and Payment:** Pounds sterling (the “**Contractual Currency**”) is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer under or in connection with this Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons, including damages.

^^**Extent of discharge:** An amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Contractual Currency (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the insolvency, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise), by the Trustee or any Noteholder or Couponholder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will only discharge the Issuer to the extent of the Contractual Currency amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

^^**Indemnity:** If that Contractual Currency amount is less than the Contractual Currency amount expressed to be due to the recipient under this Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons, the Issuer will indemnify it against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

^^**Indemnity separate:** The indemnities in this Clause 15 and in Clause 7.4 constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Trust Deed, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Trustee and/or any Noteholder or Couponholder and will continue in full force and effect despite any judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under this Trust Deed, the Notes and/or the Coupons or any other judgment or order.

A Put Notice given by a holder of any Note shall be irrevocable except where, prior to the Put Date (as defined below), an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which event such holder, at its option, may elect by notice to the Issuer to withdraw the Put Notice.

^^^A “Rating Downgrade” shall be deemed to have occurred in respect of a Restructuring Event if the then current rating assigned to the Rated Securities by and Rating Agency (whether provided by a Rating Agency at the invitation of the Issuer of by is own volition) is withdrawn or reduced from an investment grade rating (BBB-/Baa3) or their respective equivalents for the time being, or better) to a non-investment grade rating (BB+/Bal) or their respective equivalents for the time being, or worse) or, if the Rating Agency shall then have already rated the Rated Securities below investment grade (as described above), the rating is lowered one full rating category.

\centered 5.75 per cent. Notes due 2040

\centered **Global Note**

This is to certify that the bearer is entitled on 23 [[Date 2]] , or on such earlier date as the Notes designated above (the “**Notes**”) may be redeemed or repaid to such sum as is determined to be payable on such redemption or repayment in accordance with the terms and conditions (the “**Conditions**”) of the Notes set out in Schedule 1 to the trust deed dated 23 [[Date 1]] (the “**Trust Deed**”) between [[Organization 1 Name]] (South West) plc (the “**Issuer**”) and [[Organization 2 Name]] (UK) Limited as trustee (the “**Trustee**”)) upon presentation and surrender of this Global Note and to interest at the rate of 5.75 per cent. per annum on the outstanding nominal amount of the Notes in arrear on 23 March in each year, subject to and in accordance with the Conditions.

The aggregate nominal amount from time to time of this Global Note shall be that amount not exceeding £200,000,000 equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the Notes from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear S.A./N.V. (“**Euroclear**”) and/or [[Organization 5 Name]], société anonyme (“**Clearstream, Luxembourg**”) and/or any Alternative Clearing System (together, the “**relevant Clearing Systems**”), which shall be completed and or amended, as the case may be, by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent upon exchange of the whole or a part of the Temporary Globa l Note initially representing the Notes for a corresponding interest herein or upon the redemption or purchase and cancellation of Notes represented hereby or exchanged for Definitive Notes as described below.

The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this Global Note means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its accountholders which reflect the amount of such accountholders’ interests in the Notes) shall be conclusive evidence of the nominal amount of the Notes represented by this Global Note and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System stating the nominal amount of Notes represented by this Global Note at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of that relevant Clearing System at that time.

This Global Note is exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for the Definitive Notes described below (1) upon the happening of an Event of Default (as defined in Condition 9) by such holder giving notice to the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent, or (2) if this Global Note is held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or announce an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no Alternative Clearing System is available by such holder giving notice to the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent or (3) if the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage in respect of the Notes as a result of a change in the laws or reg ulations (taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of any relevant Clearing System which would not be suffered were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two directors of the Issuer is delivered to the Trustee, by the Issuer giving notice to the Trustee, Principal Paying Agent and the Noteholders, of its intention to exchange this Global Note for Definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date specified in the notice.

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of this Global Note may, or in the case of (3) above, shall surrender this Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for this Global Note, the Issuer shall deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate nominal amount of duly executed and authenticated Definitive Notes having attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on this Global Note.

“**Exchange Date**” means a day falling not less than 60 days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for general business in the city in which the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent is located and except in the case of exchange pursuant to (2) above in the cities in which Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, if relevant, the Alternative Clearing System are located.

Except as otherwise described herein, this Global Note is subject to the Conditions and the Trust Deed and, until it is exchanged for Definitive Notes, its holder shall be entitled to the same benefits as if it were the holder of the Definitive Notes for which it may be exchanged and as if such Definitive Notes had been issued on the date of this Global Note.

The Conditions shall be modified with respect to Notes represented by this Global Note by the following provisions:

**Payments**  
Principal, any premium and interest in respect of this Global Note shall be paid to its holder against presentation and (if no further payment falls to be made on it) surrender of it to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent in respect of the Notes (or to or to the order of such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for this purpose) and each payment so made will discharge the Issuer’s obligations in respect thereof. The Issuer shall procure that details of each such payment shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems, but any failure to make the entries in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems shall not affect the discharge referred to above. References in the Conditions to Coupons and Couponholders sh all be construed accordingly. No person shall however be entitled to receive any payment on this Global Note falling due after the Exchange Date, unless exchange of this Global Note for Definitive Notes is improperly withheld or refused by or on behalf of the Issuer. Condition 5.7(b) and Condition 7.1(d) will apply to the Definitive Notes only.

**Notices**  
So long as this Global Note is held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream Luxembourg and/or the Alternative Clearing System, notices required to be given to Noteholders may be given by their being delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or, as the case may be, the Alternative Clearing System, rather than by publication as required by the Conditions and any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, or, as the case may be, the Alternative Clearing System.

**Accountholders**  
For so long as all of the Notes are represented by this Global Note and this Global Note is held on behalf of a relevant Clearing System, each person (other than a relevant Clearing System) who is for the time being shown in the records of the relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular principal amount of such Notes (each an “**Accountholder**”) (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a relevant Clearing System as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or th e right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Noteholders and giving notice to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 9) other than with respect to the payment of principal and interest on such principal amount of such Notes, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the bearer of this Global Note in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder must look solely to the relevant Clearing System for its share of each payment made to the bearer of this Global Note.

**Prescription**  
Claims in respect of principal, any premium and interest in respect of this Global Note will become void unless it is presented for payment within a period of 10 years (in the case of principal and premium) and five years (in the case of interest) from the appropriate Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 7).

**Meetings**  
For the purposes of any meeting of Noteholders, the holder hereof shall (unless this Global Note represents only one Note) be treated as two persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of a meeting of Noteholders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each £50,000 nominal amount of Notes for which this Global Note may be exchanged.

**Purchase and Cancellation**  
On cancellation of any Note represented by this Global Note which is required by the Conditions to be cancelled, the Issuer shall procure that details of such cancellation shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the nominal amount of the Notes recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the aggregate nominal amount of the Notes so cancelled. Notes may only be purchased by the Issuer or any of its affiliates if (where they should be cancelled in accordance with the Conditions) they are purchased together with the right to receive interest thereon.

**Trustee’s Powers**  
In considering the interests of Noteholders in circumstances where this Global Note is held on behalf of any one or more of the relevant Clearing Systems, the Trustee may, to the extent it considers it appropriate to do so in the circumstances, (a) have regard to such information as may have been made available to it by or on behalf of each relevant Clearing System or its operator as to the identity of its accountholders (either individually or by way of category) with entitlements in respect of this Global Note and (b) consider such interests on the basis that such accountholders were the holder of this Global Note.

**Redemption at the option of Noteholders on a Restructuring Event**

For so long as this Global Note is held on behalf of any relevant Clearing System, the option of the Noteholders provided for in Condition 6.4 may be exercised by an Accountholder giving notice to the Principal Paying Agent in accordance with the standard procedures of the relevant Clearing System (which may include notice being given on his instructions by any relevant Clearing System or any common depositary for them to the Principal Paying Agent by electronic means) of the principal amount of the Notes in respect of which such option is exercised within the time limits relating to the deposit of Notes with a Paying Agent set out in that Condition. Following the exercise of any such option, the Issuer shall procure that the nominal amount of the Notes recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this Gl obal Note shall be reduced by the aggregate nominal amount stated in the relevant exercise notice.

This Global Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until authenticated by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent and effectuated by the entity appointed as Common Safekeeper by the relevant Clearing Systems.

This Global Note, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law.

In witness whereof the Issuer has caused this Global Note to be signed on its behalf.

^^^changing the currency of payment of the Notes or the Coupons or

^^^modifying the provisions in this Schedule concerning the quorum required at a meeting or the majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution or

^^^amending this proviso.

**Convening a meeting**  

The Issuer or the Trustee may at any time convene a meeting. If it receives a written request by Noteholders holding at least 10 per cent. in nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding and is indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction against all costs and expenses, the Trustee shall convene a meeting. Every meeting shall be held at a time and place approved by the Trustee.

At least 21 days’ notice (exclusive of the day on which the notice is given and of the day of the meeting) shall be given to the Noteholders. A copy of the notice shall be given by the party convening the meeting to the other parties. The notice shall specify the day, time and place of meeting and, unless the Trustee otherwise agrees, the nature of the resolutions to be proposed and shall explain how Noteholders may appoint proxies or representatives, obtain voting certificates and use block voting instructions and the details of the time limits applicable.

**Arrangements for voting**  

If a holder of a Note wishes to obtain a voting certificate in respect of it for a meeting, he must deposit it for that purpose at least 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting with a Paying Agent or to the order of a Paying Agent with a bank or other depositary nominated by the Paying Agent for the purpose. The Paying Agent shall then issue a voting certificate in respect of it.

^voting certificate shall:

^^be a document in the English language

^^be dated

^^specify the meeting concerned and the serial numbers of the Notes deposited and

^^entitle, and state that it entitles, its bearer to attend and vote at that meeting in respect of those Notes.

Once a Paying Agent has issued a voting certificate for a meeting in respect of a Note, it shall not release the Note until either:

^^the meeting has been concluded or

^^the voting certificate has been surrendered to the Paying Agent.

If a holder of a Note wishes the votes attributable to it to be included in a block voting instruction for a meeting, then, at least 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, (i) he must deposit the Note for that purpose with a Paying Agent or to the order of a Paying Agent with a bank or other depositary nominated by the Paying Agent for the purpose and (ii) he or a duly authorised person on his behalf must direct the Paying Agent how those votes are to be cast. The Paying Agent shall issue a block voting instruction in respect of the votes attributable to all Notes so deposited.

^block voting instruction shall:

^^be a document in the English language

^^be dated

^^specify the meeting concerned

^^list the total number and serial numbers of the Notes deposited, distinguishing with regard to each resolution between those voting for and those voting against it

^^certify that such list is in accordance with Notes deposited and directions received as provided in paragraphs 8, 11 and 14 and

^^appoint a named person (a “**proxy**”) to vote at that meeting in respect of those Notes and in accordance with that list.

^proxy need not be a Noteholder.  

Once a Paying Agent has issued a block voting instruction for a meeting in respect of the votes attributable to any Notes:

^^it shall not release the Notes, except as provided in paragraph 11, until the meeting has been concluded and

^^the directions to which it gives effect may not be revoked or altered during the 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting.

If the receipt for a Note deposited with a Paying Agent in accordance with paragraph 8 is surrendered to the Paying Agent at least 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, the Paying Agent shall release the Note and exclude the votes attributable to it from the block voting instruction.

Each block voting instruction shall be deposited at least 24 hours before the time fixed for the meeting at such place as the Trustee shall designate or approve, and in default it shall not be valid unless the chairman of the meeting decides otherwise before the meeting proceeds to business. If the Trustee requires, a notarially certified copy of each block voting instruction shall be produced by the proxy at the meeting but the Trustee need not investigate or be concerned with the validity of the proxy’s appointment.

^vote cast in accordance with a block voting instruction shall be valid even if it or any of the Noteholders’ instructions pursuant to which it was executed has previously been revoked or amended, unless written intimation of such revocation or amendment is received from the relevant Paying Agent by the Issuer or the Trustee at its registered office or by the chairman of the meeting in each case at least 24 hours before the time fixed for the meeting.

No Note may be deposited with or to the order of a Paying Agent at the same time for the purposes of both paragraph 5 and paragraph 8 for the same meeting.

**Chairman**  

The chairman of a meeting shall be such person as the Trustee may nominate in writing, but if no such nomination is made or if the person nominated is not present within 15 minutes after the time fixed for the meeting the Noteholders or agents present shall choose one of their number to be chairman, failing which the Issuer may appoint a chairman.

The chairman may, but need not, be a Noteholder or agent. The chairman of an adjourned meeting need not be the same person as the chairman of the original meeting.

**Attendance**  

The following may attend and speak at a meeting:

^^Noteholders and agents

^^the chairman

^^the Issuer and the Trustee (through their respective representatives) and their respective financial and legal advisers.

No-one else may attend or speak.  
**Quorum and Adjournment**  

No business (except choosing a chairman) shall be transacted at a meeting unless a quorum is present at the commencement of business. If a quorum is not present within 15 minutes from the time initially fixed for the meeting, it shall, if convened on the requisition of Noteholders or if the Issuer and the Trustee agree, be dissolved. In any other case it shall be adjourned until such date, not less than 14 nor more than 42 days later, and time and place as the chairman may decide. If a quorum is not present within 15 minutes from the time fixed for a meeting so adjourned, the meeting shall be dissolved.

Two or more Noteholders or agents present in person shall be a quorum:

^^in the cases marked “**No minimum proportion**” in the table below, whatever the proportion of the Notes which they represent

^^in any other case, only if they represent the proportion of the Notes shown by the table below.

**Column 1**   **Column 2**   **Column 3**
Purpose of meeting   Any meeting except one referred to in column 3   Meeting previously adjourned through want of a quorum
Required proportion   Required proportion
To pass a special quorum resolution   75 per cent.   25 per cent.
To pass any other Extraordinary Resolution   A clear majority   No minimum proportion
Any other purpose   10 per cent.   No minimum proportion

The chairman may with the consent of (and shall if directed by) a meeting adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place. Only business which could have been transacted at the original meeting may be transacted at a meeting adjourned in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph 18.

At least 10 days’ notice of a meeting adjourned through want of a quorum shall be given in the same manner as for an original meeting and that notice shall state the quorum required at the adjourned meeting. No notice need, however, otherwise be given of an adjourned meeting.

**Voting**  

Each question submitted to a meeting shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll is (before, or on the declaration of the result of, the show of hands) demanded by the chairman, the Issuer, the Trustee or one or more persons representing 2 per cent. of the Notes.

Unless a poll is demanded a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has or has not been passed shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes cast in favour of or against it.

If a poll is demanded, it shall be taken in such manner and (subject as provided below) either at once or after such adjournment as the chairman directs. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which it was demanded as at the date it was taken. A demand for a poll shall not prevent the meeting continuing for the transaction of business other than the question on which it has been demanded.

^poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken at once.

On a show of hands every person who is present in person and who produces a Note or a voting certificate or is a proxy has one vote. On a poll every such person has one vote for each £50,000 nominal amount of Notes so produced or represented by the voting certificate so produced or for which he is a proxy or representative. Without prejudice to the obligations of proxies, a person entitled to more than one vote need not use them all or cast them all in the same way.

In case of equality of votes the chairman shall both on a show of hands and on a poll have a casting vote in addition to any other votes which he may have.

**Effect and Publication of an Extraordinary Resolution**

An Extraordinary Resolution shall be binding on all the Noteholders, whether or not present at the meeting, and on all the Couponholders and each of them shall be bound to give effect to it accordingly. The passing of such a resolution shall be conclusive evidence that the circumstances justify its being passed. The Issuer shall give notice of the passing of an Extraordinary Resolution to Noteholders within 14 days but failure to do so shall not invalidate the resolution.

**Minutes**  

Minutes shall be made of all resolutions and proceedings at every meeting and, if purporting to be signed by the chairman of that meeting or of the next succeeding meeting, shall be conclusive evidence of the matters in them. Until the contrary is proved every meeting for which minutes have been so made and signed shall be deemed to have been duly convened and held and all resolutions passed or proceedings transacted at it to have been duly passed and transacted.

**Written Resolutions**  

^written resolution signed by the holders of 90 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes outstanding shall take effect as if it were an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

**Trustee’s Power to Prescribe Regulations**

Subject to all other provisions in this Trust Deed the Trustee may without the consent of the Noteholders prescribe such further regulations regarding the holding of meetings and attendance and voting at them as it in its sole discretion determines including (without limitation) such requirements as the Trustee shall prescribe to satisfy itself that the persons who purport to make any requisition in accordance with this Trust Deed are entitled to do so and as to the form of voting certificates or block voting instructions so as to satisfy itself that persons who purport to attend or vote at a meeting are entitled to do so.

This Trust Deed is delivered on the date stated at the beginning.
