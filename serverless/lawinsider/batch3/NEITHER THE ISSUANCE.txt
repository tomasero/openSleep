^^**Full Exercise**. This Warrant may be exercised in full by the Holder hereof by delivery to the Company of an original or facsimile copy of the form of subscription attached as **Exhibit A** hereto (the “**Subscription Form**”) duly executed by such Holder and delivery within two days thereafter of payment, in cash, wire transfer or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company, in the amount obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is then exercisable by the Purchase Price then in effect, or by cashless exercise as provided herein. The original Warrant is not required to be surrendered to the Company until it has been fully exercised.

^^**Partial Exercise**.

On any such partial exercise provided the Holder has surrendered the original Warrant, the Company, at its expense, will forthwith issue and deliver to or upon the order of the Holder hereof a new Warrant of like tenor, in the name of the Holder hereof or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request, subject to federal and state securities laws, the whole number of shares of Common Stock for which such Warrant may still be exercised.

^^**Fair Market Value**. Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of a particular date (the "**Determination Date**") shall mean:

^^If the Company's Common Stock is traded on an exchange or is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, Nasdaq Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Capital Market, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, OTC Bulletin Board, or Pink Sheets LLC, then the average of the closing or last sale prices, respectively, reported for the ten trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date;

^^If the Company's Common Stock is not traded on an exchange or quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, Nasdaq Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Capital Market, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, OTC Bulletin Board, or Pink Sheets LLC, but is traded in the over-the-counter market, then the average of the closing bid and ask prices reported for the ten trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date;

^^**Company Acknowledgment**. The Company will, at the time of the exercise of the Warrant, upon the request of the Holder hereof acknowledge in writing its continuing obligation to afford to such Holder any rights to which such Holder shall continue to be entitled after such exercise in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant. If the Holder shall fail to make any such request, such failure shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Company to afford to such Holder any such rights.

^^**Trustee for Warrant Holders**. In the event that a bank or trust company shall have been appointed as trustee for the Holder of the Warrants pursuant to Subsection 3.2, such bank or trust company shall have all the powers and duties of a warrant agent (as hereinafter described) and shall accept, in its own name for the account of the Company or such successor person as may be entitled thereto, all amounts otherwise payable to the Company or such successor, as the case may be, on exercise of this Warrant pursuant to this Section 1.

^^**Delivery of Stock Certificates, etc. on Exercise**. The Company agrees that the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to be issued to the Holder hereof as the record owner of such shares as of the close of business on the date on which delivery of a Subscription Form shall have occurred and payment made for such shares as aforesaid. As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full or in part (and regardless of method of exercise), and in any event within ten (10) business days thereafter (“**Warrant Share Delivery Date**”), the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes) will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder hereof, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, a certificate or certificates for the number of duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) to which such Holder shall be entitled on such exercise, plus, in lieu of any fractional share to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled, cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then Fair Market Value of one full share of Common Stock, together with any other stock or other securities and property (including cash, where applicable) to which such Holder is entitled upon such exercise pursuant to Section 1 or otherwise. The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of the Warrant Shares after the Warrant Share Delivery Date could result in economic loss and irreparable harm to the Holder. The Company shall not, however, be responsible for any out of pocket or potential lost profits as a result of a decline in stock price during any reasonable delay, but shall be responsible for such losses and legal/enforcement costs if it is found to have delayed unreasonably or in bad faith. Furthermore, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Holder, in the event that the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the Warrant Shares by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Holder may revoke all or part of the relevant Warrant exercise by delivery of a notice to such effect to the Company, whereupon the Company and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to the exercise of the relevant portion of this Warrant.

^**Net Issue Election**.  
^^This Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part at any time (i) by paying cash, wire transfer or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company equal to the applicable aggregate Purchase Price, (ii) by “cashless exercise” method in accordance with Section 2(b) below or (iii) by a combination of any of the foregoing methods, for the number of Common Stock specified in such form (as such exercise number shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustment in the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the holder per the terms of this Warrant) and the holder shall thereupon be entitled to receive the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) determined as provided herein.

^^Subject to the provisions herein to the contrary, if the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock is greater than the Purchase Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising this Warrant by delivery of cash, the holder may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being cancelled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with the properly endorsed Subscription Form in which event the Company shall issue to the holder a number of shares of Common Stock computed using the following formula:

\centered X=Y (A-B) A Where X= the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the holder  

^=   the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being exercised (at the date of such calculation)

^=   the average of the closing sale prices of the Common Stock for the ten (10) Trading Days immediately prior to (but not including) the Exercise Date, or Fair Market Value, whichever is less

^=   Purchase Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation)

For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act and as interpreted as of the Issue Date, it is intended, understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a cashless exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, regardless of whether subsequent changes or modifications have been made to this Warrant or the exercise price.

^**Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, Subsequent Share Issuances etc.**

^^**Fundamental Transaction**. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (A) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity, (B) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another entity) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, (D) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a "**Fundamental Transaction**"), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder, (a) upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the "**Alternate Consideration**") receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event or (b) if the Company is acquired in (1) a transaction where the consideration paid to the holders of the Common Stock consists solely of cash, (2) a “Rule 13e-3 transaction” as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the 1934 Act, or (3) a transaction involving a person or entity not traded on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market, cash equal to the Black-Scholes Value. For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Purchase Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Purchase Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder's right to exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this Section 3.1 and insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. “Black-Scholes Value” shall be determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the “OV” function on [[Organization 2 Name]] using (i) a price per share of Common Stock equal to the VWAP of the Common Stock for the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (ii) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the remaining term of this Warrant as of the date of such request and (iii) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function on [[Organization 2 Name]] determined as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction.

^^[reserved]   
^^**Continuation of Terms**. Upon any reorganization, consolidation, merger or transfer (and any dissolution following any transfer) referred to in this Section 3, this Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable to the Other Securities and property receivable on the exercise of this Warrant after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger or the effective date of dissolution following any such transfer, as the case may be, and shall be binding upon the issuer of any Other Securities, including, in the case of any such transfer, the person acquiring all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company, whether or not such person shall have expressly assumed the terms of this Warrant as provided in Section 4. In the event this Warrant does not continue in full force and effect after the consummation of the transaction described in this Section 3, then only in such event will the Company's securities and property (including cash, where applicable) receivable by the Holder of the Warrants be delivered to the Trustee as contemplated by Section 3.2.

^^**Anti-Dilution**.  
^^**Anti Dilution; Full Ratchet**. Other than in connection with an Excepted Issuance (as defined below), if at any time or from time to time, while any part of the Warrants are outstanding, the Company shall agree to or actually issue or grant the right to receive any Common Stock or securities (debt, preferred, options, warrants or otherwise) convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock (or modify any of the foregoing which may be outstanding) (“**Common Stock Equivalent**”) to any person or entity at a price per share or conversion price or exercise price per share which shall be less than the Warrant exercise price in respect of the Warrant Shares then in effect (“**Lower Price Issuance**”), without the consent of the Holder of such Warrant, then the Warrant exercise price for all remaining unexercised Warrants shall automatically and without further action be reduced to an amount equal to the price of the Common Stock Equivalent in such Lower Price Issuance (i.e. the Effective Price, as hereinafter defined).

^^**Effective Price**. For purposes of Section 3.4 in connection with any issuance of any Common Stock Equivalents, (i) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock potentially issuable at any time upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Common Stock Equivalents (the “**Deemed Number**”) shall be deemed to be outstanding or subscribed for and required to be issued upon issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents, (ii) the deemed issue price (“**Effective Price**”) applicable to such Common Stock shall equal the minimum dollar value of consideration payable to the Company to purchase such Common Stock Equivalents and to convert, exercise or exchange them into Common Stock (net of any discounts, fees, commissions and other expenses), divided by the Deemed number, and (ii) no further adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price upon the actual issuance of Common Stock upon conversion exercise or exchange of such Common Stock Equivalents if issued at or higher than the Effective Price. In the event that the Effective Price is decreased upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents and such securities are later cancelled or expire, then the Effective Price shall be adjusted upward as of the date of such cancellation or expiration as if the issuance of such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents had not occurred. Common Stock issued or issuable by the Company for no consideration will be deemed to have been issued or to be issuable for $[[USD Value 4: Number]]1 per share of Common Stock.

^^**Excepted Issuances**. The rights of each Warrant Holder set forth in this Section 3.4 are in addition to any other rights the Holder has pursuant to this Agreement, any Transaction Document, and any other agreement referred to or entered into in connection herewith or to which such Holder and Company are parties. For purposes of Section 3.4, “**Excepted Issuance**” shall mean (i) as a result of the issuance of any Shares or exercise of any of the Warrants issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreement or any of securities or warrants issued to the Placement Agent acting in connection with the sale of these Warrants (including the exercise or conversion of any of the foregoing), (ii) the Company’s issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalent upon the exercise or conversion of options, warrants or convertible notes or other securities, outstanding on the date hereof as specifically described in SEC Reports (but not if the same are not described in the SEC Reports), (iii) as granted to officers, directors or employees and other service providers in connection with any existing board approved stock option, incentive or similar plan or any stock option plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, including the exercise of the same, or to any Placement Agent (or other entity acting in a similar capital-raising capacity) in connection with its rendition of services to the Company in connection with the offering in which these Warrants were issued (iv) the issuance of securities as full or partial consideration in connection with a bonafide strategic merger, acquisition, consolidation or purchase of substantially all of the securities or assets of a corporation or other entity.

^**Extraordinary Events Regarding Common Stock**. In the event that the Company shall (a) issue additional shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (c) combine its outstanding shares of the Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, then, in each such event, the Purchase Price shall, simultaneously with the happening of such event, be adjusted by multiplying the then Purchase Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter be the Purchase Price then in effect. The Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any successive event or events described herein in this Section 4. The number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder of this Warrant shall thereafter, on the exercise hereof, be entitled to receive shall be adjusted to a number determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this Section 4) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator is the Purchase Price that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this Section 4 be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Purchase Price in effect on the date of such exercise.

^**Certificate as to Adjustments**. In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the exercise of the Warrants, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of the Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any additional shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Purchase Price and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant. The Company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the Holder of the Warrant and any Warrant Agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 11 hereof).

^**Reservation of Stock, etc. Issuable on Exercise of Warrant; Financial Statements**. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery on the exercise of the Warrants, all shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time to time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant.

^**Assignment; Exchange of Warrant**. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, this Warrant, and the rights evidenced hereby, may be transferred by any registered holder hereof (a "**Transferor**"). On the surrender for exchange of this Warrant, with the Transferor's endorsement in the form of **Exhibit B** attached hereto (the “**Transferor Endorsement Form**") and together with an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the transfer of this Warrant will be in compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company will issue and deliver to or on the order of the Transferor thereof a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor, in the name of the Transferor and/or the transferee(s) specified in such Transferor Endorsement Form (each a "**Transferee**"), calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock called for on the face or faces of the Warrant so surrendered by the Transferor.

^**Replacement of Warrant**.

^**Subscription Agreement**. The terms of the Subscription Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. Specifically, and without limitation, the benefits of the covenants set forth in Section 6.2 thereof.

^**Maximum Exercise**. The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this Warrant on an exercise date, in connection with that number of shares of Common Stock which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates on an exercise date, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant with respect to which the determination of this limitation is being made on an exercise date, which would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on such date. For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities 1934 Act , and Rule 13d-3 thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the Holder shall not be limited to aggregate exercises which would result in the issuance of more than [[Percentage 1]]%. The restriction described in this paragraph may be waived, in whole or in part, upon sixty-one (61) days prior notice from the Holder to the Company to increase such percentage to up to [[Percentage 2: Number]]%, but not in excess of [[Percentage 2]]%. The Holder may decide whether to convert a Convertible Note or exercise this Warrant to achieve an actual [[Percentage 1]]% or up to [[Percentage 2]]% ownership position as described above, but not in excess of [[Percentage 2]]%.
