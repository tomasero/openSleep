^^If the Licensee does not exercise the Pre-emptive Right, PJC shall have 120 days to enter into an agreement with an independent third party on substantially the same key terms and conditions referred to under clause 4.2(b)(ii). If the key terms of the agreement with such third party are materially different than the original terms presented in clause 4.2(b)(ii), then PJC shall provide Licensees with a Pre-emptive Right to enter into an agreement on the same key terms as agreed with such third party. If Licensee waives the Pre-emptive Right, PJC may then enter into an agreement with such third party on such key terms.

^^If PJC does not enter into an agreement with an independent third party within 120 days after the original waiver by Licensee of the Pre-emptive Right, PJC shall once again provide Licensse with the Pre-emptive Right and comply with the procedures in Section 4.2 before entering into an agreement with an independent third party.

^NO FURTHER AMENDMENT  
To the extent that this Amendment Number 1 conflicts with, modifies or supplements the License Agreement, the provisions contained in this Amendment Number 1 shall prevail and control, but in all other respects, said License Agreement is hereby ratified and confirmed.
