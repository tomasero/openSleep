^Notice and Date of Termination  

^^Any termination of the Executive’s employment by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated by a written notice of termination to the other party (the “Notice of Termination”). Where applicable, the Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive’s employment under the provision so indicated. Unless the Board determines otherwise, a Notice of Termination by the Executive alleging a termination for Good Reason must be made within 90 days of the initial instance, or the initial instance which should reasonably have been known to the Executive, of an act or failure to act that the Executive alleges to constitute Good Reason. 

^^The date of the Executive’s termination of employment with the Company (the “Date of Termination”) shall be determined as follows: 

3.2.1. If due to Company terminating the Executive’s employment, either with or without Cause, the Date of Termination shall be the date specified in the Notice of Termination; if for other than Cause, the Date of Termination shall not be less than two (2) weeks from the date such Notice of Termination is given, unless the Company elects to pay the Executive for that period in lieu of notice. 

3.2.2. If due to death, the Date of Termination is the date of death. 

3.2.3. If the basis of the Executive’s Involuntary Termination is the Executive’s resignation for Good Reason, the Date of Termination shall be determined by the Company, but shall not be less than two (2) weeks nor more than eight (8) weeks form the date such Notice of Termination is given. 

^Termination from the Board and any Offices Held. Upon termination of the Executive’s employment for any reason, the Executive agrees the Executive’s membership on the Board of the Company, the board of directors of any of the Company’s Affiliates, any committees of the Board, any committees of the board of directors of any of the Company’s Affiliates and any and all offices held, if applicable, shall be automatically terminated. Executive hereby agrees to cooperate with the Company and execute any documents reasonably required by the Company or competent authorities to effect this provision. 

^Severance Benefits upon Involuntary Termination Prior to Change in Control. Except as provided in Sections 6 and 17 hereof, in the event of the Involuntary Termination of the Executive prior to a Change in Control, the Company shall pay to the Executive the following Pre-Change in Control Severance Payment in the following amounts and manner: 

^^The total payment will be equal to the product of twelve (12) months (the “Total Number of Months”) multiplied by 1.45 times monthly base pay. Provided, however, if the termination occurs within the first two (2) years of the Executive’s initial employment, the Total Number of Months shall not be less than eighteen (18) months. 

^^The payment will be made as follows: (i) half in a lump sum payable at or within a reasonable period of time after the Date of Termination and (ii) subject to receipt of an executed Release that has not been revoked, the remaining half in installments starting six (6) months after the Date of Termination with a final installment of all remaining amounts to be paid on or before [[Date 2: Date]] of the calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurred. The amount of each installment payment described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence will be determined by dividing half of the total payment by [[Percentage 1]]% of the Total Number of Months. The final installment will be equal to the total payment reduced by all the amounts previously paid (i.e., the lump sum payment and the sum of all the installment payments previously paid). Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (ii) to the contrary, if the 

^^^^^ 
\centered

six month period would cause the installments to begin to be paid after the [[Date 2]] date described in the first sentence of this section 5.2, then no installments will be paid, and the second payment will be a lump sum equal to half the total payment and that payment will be paid on or before [[Date 2]] of the calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurred. The installment payments (or the second lump sum payment, if applicable) are specifically designated as consideration for execution of the Release required in Section 13 and compliance with Executive’s covenants outlined in Section 13.

5.3.2. Equity Based Compensation. All equity-based Incentive Compensation Awards (including, without limitation, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards or other related awards) held by the Executive shall be governed by the terms of the applicable Incentive Compensation Plan and Incentive Compensation Award agreement, and this Agreement shall have no effect upon them. 

5.3.3. Welfare Benefits. Subject to Section 11 herein, the Executive shall be eligible for health and dental coverage as provided for under COBRA, using the normal COBRA administration process of the Company.

receive a payment for use in continuation of insurance coverage, such payment to be equal to the annual supplemental executive insurance benefit provided to the Executive prior to the Executive’s Date of Termination. The Company will use its best efforts to make this payment at the time requested. 

5.3.8. Attorney’s Fees in Defense of This Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall pay all reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses for the Executive if the Executive must engage an attorney in order to enforce this Agreement following the Executive’s Date of Termination.

The final installment will be equal to the total payment reduced by all the amounts previously paid (i.e., the lump sum payment and the sum of all the installment payments previously paid). Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (ii) to the contrary, if the six month period would cause the installments to begin to be paid after the [[Date 2]] date described in the first sentence of this section 6.2, then no installments will be paid, and the second payment will be a lump sum equal to half the total payment and that payment will be paid on [[Date 2]] of the calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurred. The installment payments (or the second lump sum payment, if applicable) are specifically designated as consideration for execution of the Release required in Section 13 and compliance with Executive’s covenants outlined in Section 13.

^Severance Benefits upon Termination by the Company for Cause or by the Executive Other than for Good Reason. If the Executive’s employment shall be terminated for Cause, or if the Executive terminates employment other than for Good Reason, the Company will have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other than the Pre-Change in Control Accrued Obligations and any amounts described in Section 10 hereof.

^Severance Benefits upon Termination due to Death. If the Executive’s employment shall terminate by reason of death, the Company shall pay the Executive’s estate the Post-Change in Control Accrued Obligations and any amounts or benefits described in Section 10 herein. Such payments shall be in addition to those rights and benefits to which the Executive’s estate may be entitled under the relevant Company plans or programs. 

^Adjustments to Maximize After-Tax Benefits. In the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or its Affiliates to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9 ( a “Payment”) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Excise Tax”) , then the Executive’s Unreduced and Reduced Net Benefit shall be determined and the Payments shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 9.3. 

^^For purposes of Section 9.3 the Unreduced Net Benefit shall equal the Payments, less the amount of federal, state and local income and other taxes (including the excise tax under Code Section 4999) payable with respect to such benefits. For these purposes, the federal, state, local and any other taxes shall be calculated at the maximum marginal income tax rates applicable to such Executive for each year in which the foregoing amounts shall be paid. 

9.2.For purposes of Section 9.3 the Reduced Net Benefit shall equal the amount determined under Section 9.1 but with the Payments first reduced by an amount such that the present value of all payments and benefits that the Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the Company that would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Code Section 280G does not exceed 2.99 times the Executive’s “base amount,” as defined under Code Section 280G. For purposes of calculating the aggregate present value of such parachute payments, the requirements of Code Section 280G shall be followed. 

^^If the Executive’s Reduced Net Benefit is greater than the Unreduced Net Benefit, then the amount of the Payments set forth in Section 9.2 of the Agreement shall be reduced to an aggregate present value amount that does not subject any of the payments to taxation under Code Section 4999. 

^^A nationally recognized accounting firm as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Executive (the “Accounting Firm”) shall perform any and all calculations required under Code Section 280G, and shall determine the Executive’s Reduced and Unreduced Net Benefit. Such determination shall be made within ten (10) business days of the date of a change in control or ownership as determined under Code Section 280G and such determinations shall be binding on the Company and the Executive. In the event a reduction of the Payments is to be made pursuant to Section 9.3, the Executive shall have discretion to determine which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of Section 9.3 and in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A. The Executive shall make such decision no later than five (5) business days following the determination by the independent accounting firm of the Executive’s Reduced and Unreduced Net Benefit. 

^Nonexclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive’s continuing or future participation in any benefit plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any benefit to which the Executive has waived the Executive’s rights in writing), including, without limitation, any and all indemnification arrangements in favor of the Executive (whether under agreements or under the Company’s charter documents or otherwise), and insurance policies covering the Executive, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any other contract or agreement entered into after the Effective Date with the Company. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the

Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or program of, or any contract or agreement entered into with, the Company shall be payable in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement. At all times during the Executive’s employment with the Company and thereafter, the Company shall provide the Executive with indemnification and director and officer insurance insuring the Executive against insurable events which occur or have occurred while the Executive was a director or executive officer of the Company, on terms and conditions that are at least as generous as that then provided to any other current or former director or executive officer of the Company or any Affiliate. 

^Full Settlement; Mitigation. The Company’s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform the obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others, provided that nothing herein shall preclude the Company from separately pursuing recovery from the Executive based on any such claim. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. 

^Representations. The Executive hereby represents to the Company that the Executive is legally entitled to enter into this Agreement and to perform the Executive’s obligations hereunder, and that the Executive has the full right, power and authority, subject to no rights of any third parties, to grant to the Company the rights contemplated in Section 13.2.

^^if the Company believes a breach has occurred, it will deliver to the Executive a summary of the breach and a demand for explanation or agreement that such breach has occurred; the Executive shall have twenty (20) business days to respond in writing to this demand, whereupon the Company will make a decision as to whether the breach has, in fact, occurred; if it is determined such a breach has occurred, then 

^^the Company’s obligation to make any payment or provide any benefits to the Executive under Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement shall cease immediately and permanently, which shall not have any impact whatsoever on the Executive’s continuing obligations under Sections 14.3 and 14.4 below, except, however, the benefits outlined in Sections 5.3.8 and 6.3.8 will continue to be provided;

^^It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Section 14 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the applicable laws in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any portion of this Section 14 is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this Section 14 shall be deemed curtailed, whether as to time or location, to the minimum extent required for its validity under applicable law and shall be binding and enforceable with respect to the Executive as so curtailed, such curtailment to apply only with respect to the operation of this Section 14 in the jurisdiction in which the such adjudication is made. If a court in any jurisdiction, in adjudicating the validity of this Section 14, imposes any additional terms or restrictions with respect to this Section 14, this Section 14 shall be deemed amended to incorporate such additional terms or restrictions. 

^^Executive agrees and acknowledges that Executive has received good and adequate consideration for the covenants set forth in this Section 14 in the form of employment, compensation and benefits separate and independent of any payments or potential payments in this Agreement. 

^Potential Impact of Accounting Restatements on Certain Bonuses and Profits. 

^^If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations affecting any reporting period that transpires during the term of this Agreement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial requirements under the securities laws, the Company’s Board will be entitled to determine whether the noncompliance was the result of knowing, intentional, fraudulent or illegal conduct by the Executive, and if it so determines, to require the Executive to reimburse the Company for (i) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received by the Executive from the Company during the term of this Agreement and (ii) any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer by the Executive during the term of this Agreement. 

^^In making the determination whether to seek reimbursement from Executive, the Board will consider whether any bonus, incentive payment, equity award, or other compensation has been awarded or received by the Executive during the term of this Agreement and whether such compensation was based on any financial results or operating metrics that were satisfied as a result of the Executive’s knowing, intentional, fraudulent or illegal conduct. The Board has sole discretion in determining whether the Executive’s conduct has or has not met the standard of such forfeiture. 

^^If the Board determines that a forfeiture is appropriate, such amounts shall be withheld from any future amounts owed to the Executive as compensation. The Company may commence legal action to collect such sums as the Board determines is owed to the Company. 

^Successors.  

^^Assignment by the Executive. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

The provisions of this Section 17 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the occurrence of a Change in Control. 

^Delayed Commencement of Certain Payments.

however, that no detailed information concerning the Executive’s physical examination will be provided to the Company or made available to the Company by the insurance company. 

^^Waiver of Breach. A waiver by the Company or the Executive of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the other party.
