In addition to the authority specifically granted to the Committee in this Plan, the Committee has full discretionary authority to administer this Plan, including but not limited to the authority to (i) interpret the provisions of this Plan, (ii) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to this Plan, (iii) correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it deems desirable to carry this Plan, such Award or such Award Agreement into effect and (iv) make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan. All decisions, interpretations and other actions of the Committee shall be final and binding on all Participants and any other individual with a right under the Plan or under any Award.

^^*Delegation to Other Committees or CEO*. To the extent applicable law permits, the Board may delegate to another committee of the Board, or the Committee may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, any or all of the authority and responsibility of the Committee. However, no such delegation is permitted with respect to Awards made to Section 16 Participants at the time any such delegated authority or responsibility is exercised. The Board also may delegate to another committee of the Board consisting entirely of Non-Employee Directors any or all of the authority and responsibility of the Committee with respect to individuals who are Section 16 Participants. If the Board or Committee has made such a delegation, then all references to the Committee in this Plan include such other committee or the Chief Executive Officer to the extent of such delegation.

^^*Indemnification*. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or the Committee, the members of the Board and the Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which they or any of them may be party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any Award, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except a judgment based upon a finding of bad faith; provided that upon the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding a Committee or Board member shall, in writing, give the Company notice thereof and an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before such Committee or Board member undertakes to handle and defend it on such member’s own behalf.

^**Eligibility****.** The Committee may designate any of the following as a Participant from time to time: any officer or other employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, an individual that the Company or an Affiliate has engaged to become an officer or other employee, a Director, or a consultant or advisor who provides bona fide services to the Company or an Affiliate as an independent contractor. The Committee’s designation of a Participant in any year will not require the Committee to designate such person to receive an Award in any other year.

^**Types of Awards****.** Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee may grant any type of Award to any Participant it selects, but only employees of the Company or a Subsidiary may receive grants of Incentive Stock Options. Awards may be granted alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or in substitution for any other Award (or any other award granted under another plan of the Company or any Affiliate). Awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement except to the extent the Committee provides otherwise.

^**Shares Reserved under this Plan****.**

^^*Plan Reserve*. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 16, an aggregate of two million seven hundred fifty thousand (2,750,000) Shares, plus the number of Shares described in Section 6(c), are reserved for issuance under this Plan. The number of Shares reserved for issuance under this Plan shall be reduced only by the number of Shares delivered in payment or settlement of Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may issue only one million seven hundred fifty thousand (2,750,000) Shares upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options.

^^*Replenishment of Shares Under this Plan*. If an Award lapses, expires, terminates or is cancelled without the issuance of Shares under the Award, or if Shares are forfeited under an Award, then the Shares subject to such Award may again be used for new Awards under this Plan under Section 6(a), including issuance as Incentive Stock Options. If Shares are issued under any Award and the Company subsequently reacquires them pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance of the Shares, or if previously owned Shares are delivered to the Company in payment of the exercise price of an Award or the withholding taxes due as a result of the issuance or receipt of a payment or Shares under an Award, then such Shares may again be used for new Awards under this Plan under Section 6(a), but such Shares may not be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.

^^*Addition of Shares from Predecessor Plan*. After the Effective Date, if any Shares subject to awards granted under the 1995 Plan would again become available for new grants under the terms of such plan, then those Shares will be available for the purpose of granting Awards under this Plan, thereby increasing the number of Shares available for issuance under this Plan as determined under the first sentence of Section 6(a). Any such Shares will not be available for future awards under the terms of the 1995 Plan after the Effective Date. The maximum number of additional Shares that may become available under this Section 6(c) following stockholder approval of the 2010 amendment to this Plan is [[Shares 1: Number]] Shares.

^^*Participant Limitations*. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 16, with respect to Awards that are intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Code Section 162(m), no Participant may be granted Awards that could result in such Participant:

^^^receiving in any calendar year Options for, and/or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to, more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) Shares (reduced, in the initial calendar year in which this Plan is effective, by the number of options granted to a Participant under the 1995 Plan in such year, if any), except that Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights granted to a new employee in the calendar year in which his or her employment commences may not relate to more than five hundred thousand (500,000) Shares;

^^^receiving in any calendar year Awards of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units relating to more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) Shares;

^^^receiving in any calendar year Awards of Performance Shares, and/or Awards of Performance Units (the value of which is based on the Fair Market Value of a Share), for more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) Shares; or

^^^receiving in any calendar year Awards of Performance Units (the value of which is not based on the Fair Market Value of a Share) that could result in a payment of more than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($[[USD Value 1: Number]]).

With respect to Awards that are not intended to meet the requirements of performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the Committee may grant Awards in excess of the limits described in this subsection (d), but only if such discretion would not cause Awards that are intended to be performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) from being treated as such. 

^**Options****.**

^^*Discretionary Grants*. Except as provided in subsection (b) and subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee will determine all terms and conditions of each Option, including but not limited to:

^^^Whether the Option is an Incentive Stock Option, or a “nonqualified stock option” which does not meet the requirements of Code Section 422; provided that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, if the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of the Shares with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options are first exercisable by the Participant during any calendar year (under this Plan and under all other incentive stock option plans of the Company or any Affiliate that is required to be included under Code Section 422) exceeds $[[USD Value 2: Number]] such Option automatically shall be treated as a nonqualified stock option to the extent this limit is exceeded.

^^^The number of Shares subject to the Option.

^^^The exercise price per Share, which may not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share as determined on the date of grant; provided that (i) no Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any employee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns (directly or indirectly, within the meaning of Code Section 424(d)) more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Subsidiary unless the exercise price is at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant; and (ii) the exercise price may vary during the term of the Option if the Committee determines that there should be adjustments to the exercise price relating to achievement of Performance Goals and/or to changes in an index or indices that the Committee determines is appropriate (but in no event may the exercise price per Share be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share as determined on the date of grant).

^^^The terms and conditions of exercise, which may include a requirement that exercise of the Option is conditioned upon achievement of one or more Performance Goals or may provide for an acceleration of the exercisability upon the Participant’s death, Disability or Retirement.

^^^The termination date, except that each Option must terminate no later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant, and each Incentive Stock Option granted to any employee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns (directly or indirectly, within the meaning of Code Section 424(d)) more than ten percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Subsidiary must terminate no later than the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may extend the term of an Option for up to six (6) months beyond the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant in the event a Participant dies prior to the Option’s termination date.

^^^The exercise period following a Participant’s termination of employment or service.

In all other respects, the terms of any Incentive Stock Option should comply with the provisions of Code Section 422 except to the extent the Committee determines otherwise. 

^**Stock Appreciation Rights****.** Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee will determine all terms and conditions of each SAR, including but not limited to:

^^Whether the SAR is granted independently of an Option or relates to an Option; provided that if an SAR is granted in relation to an Option, then unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the SAR shall be exercisable or shall mature at the same time or times, on the same conditions and to the extent and in the proportion, that the related Option is exercisable and may be exercised or mature for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option. Upon exercise of any number of SARs, the number of Shares subject to the related Option shall be reduced accordingly and such Option may not be exercised with respect to that number of Shares. The exercise of any number of Options that relate to an SAR shall likewise result in an equivalent reduction in the number of Shares covered by the related SAR.

^^The number of Shares to which the SAR relates.

^^The grant price, provided that the grant price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the SAR as determined on the date of grant.

^^The terms and conditions of exercise or maturity, which may include a provision that accelerates the exercisability of the SAR upon the Participant’s death, Disability or Retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Committee determines otherwise in the Award Agreement, if on the date when the SAR expires or otherwise terminates, the grant price for the SAR is less than the Fair Market Value of a Share, then the unexercised portion of the SAR that was exercisable immediately prior to such date shall automatically be deemed exercised.

^^The term, provided that an SAR must terminate no later than 10 years after the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may extend the term of an SAR for up to six (6) months beyond the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of grant in the event a Participant dies prior to the SAR’s termination date.

^^Whether the SAR will be settled in cash, Shares or a combination thereof.

^**Performance Awards****.** Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee will determine all terms and conditions of each award of Performance Shares or Performance Units, including but not limited to:

^^The number of Shares and/or units to which such Award relates, and with respect to Performance Units, whether the value of each unit will be based on the Fair Market Value of one or more Shares, the average of the Fair Market Value of one or more Shares over such period as the Committee specifies, or such other value as the Committee specifies in the Award Agreement.

^^One or more Performance Goals that must be achieved during such period as the Committee specifies in order for the Participant to realize the benefit of such Award.

^^Whether all or a portion of the Performance Goals subject to an Award are deemed achieved upon a Participant’s death, Disability or Retirement.

^^With respect to Performance Units, whether to settle such Award in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares.

^**Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards****.** Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee will determine all terms and conditions of each award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, including but not limited to:

^^The number of Shares and/or units to which such Award relates.

^^The period of time over which the restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock will lapse and the vesting of Restricted Stock Units will occur, and whether, as a condition for the Participant to realize all or a portion of the benefit provided under the Award, one or more Performance Goals must be achieved during such period as the Committee specifies; provided that, subject to the provisions of Section 10(c), an Award that is subject to the achievement of Performance Goals must have a restriction or vesting period of at least one year, and an Award that is not subject to Performance Goals must have a restriction or vesting period of at least three years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Committee determines in its sole discretion that an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units is granted to a Participant in lieu of cash compensation (including without limitation bonus cash compensation), the Committee may impose such restriction or vesting period on such Award as it determines.

^^Whether all or any portion of the restrictions or vesting schedule imposed on the Award will lapse or be accelerated upon a Participant’s death, Disability or Retirement.

^^With respect to Restricted Stock Units, whether to settle such Awards in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares.

^^With respect to Restricted Stock, the manner of registration of certificates for such Shares, and whether to hold such Shares in escrow pending lapse of the restrictions or to issue such Shares with an appropriate legend referring to such restrictions.

^^Whether dividends paid with respect to an Award of Restricted Stock will be immediately paid or held in escrow or otherwise deferred and whether such dividends shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Award to which they relate.

^**Dividend Equivalent Units****.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, the Committee will determine all terms and conditions of each award of Dividend Equivalent Units, including but not limited to whether such Award will be granted in tandem with another Award, and the form, timing and conditions of payment.

^**Payment of Directors’ Fees in Options****.** Subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by the Board, a Director may elect to receive all or any portion of his or her annual cash retainer payment from the Company in the form of Options. The number of Options granted as a result of such election shall be determined by multiplying the amount of foregone cash compensation by four (4), and dividing such product by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the cash compensation would have otherwise been paid to the Director. Such Options shall be issued under and subject to the terms of this Plan. An election under this Section 12 shall be filed with the Company on such form and in such manner as the Board determines.

^**Transferability****.** Awards are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and to the extent the Committee allows a Participant to: (a) designate in writing a beneficiary to exercise the Award after the Participant’s death; or (b) transfer an Award.

^^*Survival of Authority and Awards*. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority of the Board and the Committee under this Section 14 will extend beyond the date of this Plan’s termination. In addition, termination of this Plan will not affect the rights of Participants with respect to Awards previously granted to them, and all unexpired Awards will continue in force and effect after termination of this Plan except as they may lapse or be terminated by their own terms and conditions.

^^*Repricing Prohibited*. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, and except for the adjustments provided in Section 16, neither the Committee nor any other person may decrease the exercise price for any outstanding Option after the date of grant nor cancel or allow a Participant to surrender an outstanding Option to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new Option with a lower exercise price or the grant of another type of Award the effect of which is to reduce the exercise price of any outstanding Option.

^^*Foreign Participation*. To assure the viability of Awards granted to Participants employed in foreign countries, the Committee may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of, this Plan as it determines is necessary or appropriate for such purposes. Any such amendment, restatement or alternative versions that the Committee approves for purposes of using this Plan in a foreign country will not affect the terms of this Plan for any other country. In addition, all such supplements, amendments, restatements or alternative versions must comply with the provisions of Section 14(b)(ii).

**Taxes.**

^^*Withholding Right*. The Company is entitled to withhold the amount of any tax attributable to any amount payable or Shares deliverable under this Plan after giving the person entitled to receive such amount or Shares notice as far in advance as practicable, and the Company may defer making payment or delivery if any such tax may be pending unless and until indemnified to its satisfaction.

^^*Use of Shares to Satisfy Tax Withholding*. The Committee may permit a Participant to satisfy all or a portion of the federal, state and local withholding tax obligations arising in connection with an Award by electing to (i) have the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under the Award, (ii) tender back Shares received in connection with such Award or (iii) deliver other previously owned Shares, in each case having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount to be withheld. However, the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total minimum federal, state and local tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction to the extent required to avoid an expense on the Company’s financial statements. The election must be made on or before the date as of which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined and otherwise as the Committee requires.

^**Adjustment Provisions; Change of Control.**

^^*Adjustment of Shares*. If the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that the Committee determines an adjustment to be appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, then, subject to Participants’ rights under Section 16(c), the Committee may, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares subject to this Plan (including the number and type of Shares described in Sections 6(a) and 6(d)), and which may after the event be made the subject of Awards under this Plan, (ii) the number and type of Shares subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant, purchase, or exercise price with respect to any Award. In any such case, the Committee may also (or in lieu of the foregoing) make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award in exchange for the cancellation of all or a portion of the Award (without the consent of the holder of an Award) in an amount determined by the Committee effective at such time as the Committee specifies (which may be the time such transaction or event is effective), but if such transaction or event constitutes a Change of Control, then (A) such payment shall be at least as favorable to the holder as the amount the holder could have received in respect of such Award under Section 16(c) and (B) from and after the Change of Control, the Committee may make such a provision only if the Committee determines that doing so is necessary to substitute, for each Share then subject to an Award, the number and kind of shares of stock, other securities, cash or other property to which holders of Stock are or will be entitled in respect of each Share pursuant to the transaction or event in accordance with the last sentence of this subsection (a). However, in each case, with respect to Awards of Incentive Stock Options, no such adjustment may be authorized to the extent that such authority would cause this Plan to violate Code Section 422(b). Further, the number of Shares subject to any Award payable or denominated in Shares must always be a whole number. Without limitation, subject to Participants’ rights under Section 16(c), in the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or other similar corporate transaction or event, whether or not constituting a Change of Control (other than any such transaction in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the outstanding Stock is not being converted into or exchanged for different securities, cash or other property, or any combination thereof), the Committee may substitute, on an equitable basis as the Committee determines, for each Share then subject to an Award, the number and kind of shares of stock, other securities, cash or other property to which holders of Stock are or will be entitled in respect of each Share pursuant to the transaction.

^^*Issuance or Assumption*. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, and without affecting the number of Shares otherwise reserved or available under this Plan, in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization, the Committee may authorize the issuance or assumption of awards under this Plan upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate.

^^*Change of Control*.

^^^The Committee may specify, either in an Award Agreement or at the time of a Change of Control, whether an outstanding Award shall become vested and/or payable, in whole or part, as a result of the Change of Control.

^^^If, in connection with the Change of Control, the Options and SARs issued under the Plan are not assumed, or if substitute Options and SARs are not issued, or if the assumed or substituted awards fail to contain similar terms and conditions as the Award prior to the Change of Control or fail to preserve, to the extent applicable, the benefit to be provided to the Participant as of the date of the Change of Control, including but not limited to the right of the Participant to receive shares upon exercise of the Option or SAR that are registered for sale to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, then each holder of an Option or SAR that is outstanding as of the date of the Change of Control shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Company (or its successor in the Change of Control transaction) within 30 days after the Change of Control (but not beyond the Option’s or SAR’s expiration date), to receive, in exchange for the surrender of the Option or SAR, an amount of cash equal to the excess of the greater of the Fair Market Value of the Shares determined on the Change of Control date or the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of surrender covered by the Option or SAR (to the extent vested and not yet exercised) that is so surrendered over the purchase or grant price of such Shares under the Award. If the Committee so determines prior to the Change of Control, any such Option or SAR that is not exercised or surrendered prior to the end of such 30-day period will be cancelled.

^^^If, in connection with the Change of Control, the Shares issued to a Participant as a result of the accelerated vesting or payment of a Restricted Stock Award, Performance Share Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, Performance Unit Award or Dividend Equivalent Award under this subsection (c) are not registered for sale to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, then each holder of such Shares shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Company (or its successor in the Change of Control transaction) within 30 days after the Change of Control, to receive, in exchange for the surrender of such Shares an amount of cash equal to the greater of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Change of Control date or the Fair Market Value of such Share on the date of surrender.

^^*Parachute Payment Limitation*.

^^^*Scope of Limitation*. This Section 16(d) shall apply to an Award only if:

^the independent auditors most recently selected by the Board (the “Auditors”) determine that the after-tax value of such Award to the Participant, taking into account the effect of all federal, state and local income taxes, employment taxes and excise taxes applicable to the Participant (including the excise tax under Code Section 4999), will be greater after the application of this Section 16(d) than it was before the application of this Section 16(d); or

^the Committee, at the time of making an Award under the Plan or at any time thereafter, specifies in writing that such Award shall be subject to this Section 16(d) (regardless of the after-tax value of such Award to the Participant).

If this Section 16(d) applies to an Award, it shall supersede any contrary provision of the Plan or of any Award granted under the Plan. 

^^^*Basic Rule*. Except as may be set forth in a written agreement by and between the Company and the holder of an Award, in the event that the Auditors determine that any payment or transfer by the Company under the Plan to or for the benefit of a Participant (a “Payment”) would be nondeductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes because of the provisions concerning “excess parachute payments” in Code Section 280G, then the aggregate present value of all Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount. For purposes of this Section 16(d), the “Reduced Amount” shall be the amount, expressed as a present value, which maximizes the aggregate present value of the Payments without causing any Payment to be nondeductible by the Company because of Code Section 280G.

^^^*Reduction of Payments*. If the Auditors determine that any Payment would be nondeductible by the Company because of Code Section 280G, then the Company shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof and of the Reduced Amount, and the Participant may then elect, in his or her sole discretion, which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the aggregate present value of the Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall advise the Company in writing of his or her election within ten (10) days of receipt of notice. If no such election is made by the Participant within such ten (10) day period, then the Company may elect which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the aggregate present value of the Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify the Participant promptly of such election. For purposes of this Section 16(d), present value shall be determined in accordance with Code Section 280G(d)(4). All determinations made by the Auditors under this Section 16(d) shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and shall be made within sixty (60) days of the date when a Payment becomes payable or transferable. As promptly as practicable following such determination and the elections hereunder, the Company shall pay or transfer to or for the benefit of the Participant such amounts as are then due to him or her under the Plan and shall promptly pay or transfer to or for the benefit of the Participant in the future such amounts as become due to him or her under the Plan.

^^^*Overpayments and Underpayments*. As a result of uncertainty in the application of Code Section 280G at the time of an initial determination by the Auditors hereunder, it is possible that Payments will have been made by the Company that should not have been made (an “Overpayment”) or that additional Payments that will not have been made by the Company could have been made (an “Underpayment”), consistent in each case with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Auditors, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant that the Auditors believe has a high probability of success, determine that an Overpayment has been made, such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Participant which he or she shall repay to the Company, together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided in Code Section 7872(f)(2); provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by the Participant to the Company if and to the extent that such payment would not reduce the amount subject to taxation under Code Section 4999. In the event that the Auditors determine that an Underpayment has occurred, such Underpayment shall promptly be paid or transferred by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant, together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided in Code Section 7872(f)(2).

^^^*Related Corporations*. For purposes of this Section 16(d), the term “Company” shall include affiliated corporations to the extent determined by the Auditors in accordance with Code Section 280G(d)(5).

^**Miscellaneous.**

^^*Other Terms and Conditions*. The grant of any Award may also be subject to other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Award granted to any other Participant) as the Committee determines appropriate, including, without limitation, provisions for:

^^^one or more means to enable Participants to defer the delivery of Shares or recognition of taxable income relating to Awards or cash payments derived from the Awards on such terms and conditions as the Committee determines, including, by way of example, the form and manner of the deferral election, the treatment of dividends paid on the Shares during the deferral period or a means for providing a return to a Participant on amounts deferred, and the permitted distribution dates or events (provided that if Shares would have otherwise been issued under an Award but for the deferral described in this paragraph, then such Shares shall be treated as if they were issued for purposes of Sections 6(a));

^^^the payment of the purchase price of Options by delivery of cash or other Shares or other securities of the Company (including by attestation) having a then Fair Market Value equal to the purchase price of such Shares, or by delivery (including by fax) to the Company or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions to a broker-dealer to sell or margin a sufficient portion of the Shares and deliver the sale or margin loan proceeds directly to the Company to pay for the exercise price;

^^^conditioning the grant or benefit of an Award on the Participant’s agreement to comply with covenants not to compete, not to solicit employees and customers and not to disclose confidential information that may be effective during or after the Participant’s employment or service, and/or provisions requiring the Participant to disgorge any profit, gain or other benefit received in connection with an Award as a result of the breach of such covenant;

^^^the automatic grant of a new Option (the “replenishment Option”) to a Participant who pays the exercise price of an existing Option in Shares; provided that the replenishment Option shall cover only that number of Shares that is used to pay the exercise price and shall expire at the same time as the original Option to which it relates;

^^^restrictions on resale or other disposition of Shares, including imposition of a retention period; and

^^^compliance with federal or state securities laws and stock exchange requirements.

^^*Employment or Service*. The issuance of an Award shall not confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continued employment or service with the Company or any Affiliate, or the right to continue as a Director. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, for purposes of the Plan and all Awards, the following rules shall apply:

^^^a Participant who transfers employment between the Company and any Affiliate of the Company, or between the Company’s Affiliates, will not be considered to have terminated employment;

^^^a Participant who ceases to be a Non-Employee Director because he or she becomes an employee of the Company or an Affiliate shall not be considered to have ceased service as a Director with respect to any Award until such Participant’s termination of employment with the Company and its Affiliates;

^^^a Participant who ceases to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and immediately thereafter becomes a Non-Employee Director, a non-employee director of any Affiliate, or a consultant to the Company or any Affiliate shall not be considered to have terminated employment until such Participant’s service as a director of, or consultant to, the Company and its Affiliates has ceased; and

^^^a Participant employed by an Affiliate of the Company will be considered to have terminated employment when such entity ceases to be an Affiliate of the Company.

^^*No Fractional Shares*. No fractional Shares or other securities may be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan, and the Committee may determine whether cash, other securities or other property will be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or other securities, or whether such fractional Shares or other securities or any rights to fractional Shares or other securities will be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.

^^*Unfunded Plan*. This Plan is unfunded and does not create, and should not be construed to create, a trust or separate fund with respect to this Plan’s benefits. This Plan does not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. To the extent any person holds any rights by virtue of an Award granted under this Plan, such rights are no greater than the rights of the Company’s general unsecured creditors.

^^*Requirements of Law and Securities Exchange*. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares in connection with an Award are subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement, the Company has no liability to deliver any Shares under this Plan or make any payment unless such delivery or payment would comply with all applicable laws and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity, and unless and until the Participant has taken all actions required by the Company in connection therewith. The Company may impose such restrictions on any Shares issued under the Plan as the Company determines necessary or desirable to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations or the requirements of any national securities exchanges.

^^*Governing Law*. This Plan, and all agreements under this Plan, will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to any conflict of law principles. The parties agree that the exclusive venue for any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement, shall be a court sitting in the County of Los Angeles, or the Federal District Court for the Central District of California sitting in the County of Los Angeles, in the State of California, and further agree that any such action may be heard only in a “bench” trial, and any party to such action or proceeding shall agree to waive its right to assert a jury trial.

^^*Limitations on Actions*. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement, must be brought within one year (365 days) after the day the complaining party first knew or should have known of the events giving rise to the complaint.

^^*Construction*. Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were used in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and wherever any words are used in the singular or plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply. Title of sections are for general information only, and this Plan is not to be construed with reference to such titles.

^^*Severability*. If any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement or any Award (i) is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or (ii) would disqualify this Plan, any Award Agreement or any Award under any law the Committee deems applicable, then such provision should be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of this Plan, Award Agreement or Award, then such provision should be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of this Plan, such Award Agreement and such Award will remain in full force and effect.
