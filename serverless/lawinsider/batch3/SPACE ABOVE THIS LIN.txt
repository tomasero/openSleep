Assumptor hereby assumes and agrees, for the benefit of Noteholder and its successors and assigns, to be bound by, observe and perform, all past (to the extent unsatisfied), present and future liabilities, terms, provisions, covenants and obligations of Borrower under the Note and the other Loan Documents. Assumptor agrees that it will be bound by all of such terms and provisions, promptly pay all such liabilities and promptly observe and perform all such covenants and obligations, with the same force and effect as if Assumptor had originally executed and delivered the Note and other Loan Documents instead of Borrower and as if Borrower has never and/or had never been released of any obligation and/or liability under the Note and other Loan Documents.

For the period of time from the inception of time up to and including the Closing Date, a reference in any Loan Document, including the Note, to Original Indemnitor, therefore, shall also be deemed a reference to Substitute Indemnitor.

Substitute Indemnitor hereby consents to the release by Noteholder, at any time, of Original Indemnitor’s obligations and liabilities under the Loan Documents; Substitute Indemnitor hereby acknowledges that any such release of Original Indemnitor shall not affect Substitute Indemnitor’s obligations and liabilities under the Loan Documents.

^**Repair and Remediation Reserve**. Prior to the execution of this Assumption Agreement, Noteholder has caused the Property to be inspected and such inspection has revealed that the Property is in need of certain maintenance, repairs and/or remedial or corrective work. Contemporaneously with the execution hereof, Assumptor has established with Noteholder a reserve in the amount of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the estimated costs of the repairs, which amount is $[[USD Value 3: Number]] (the “Repair and Remediation Reserve”) by depositing such amount with Noteholder. Assumptor shall cause each of the items identified in that certain Property Condition Report performed by [[Organization 6 Name]] on [[Date 6: Date]] (the “Deferred Maintenance”) to be completed, performed, remediated and corrected to the satisfaction of Noteholder on or before the expiration of six (6) months after the Closing Date hereof, as such time period may be extended by Noteholder in its sole discretion. So long as no default hereunder or under the other Loan Documents has occurred and is continuing, all sums in the Repair and Remediation Reserve shall be held by Noteholder in the Repair and Remediation Reserve to pay the costs and expenses of completing the Deferred Maintenance. So long as no default hereunder or under the other Loan Documents has occurred and is continuing, Noteholder shall, to the extent funds are available for such purpose in the Repair and Remediation Reserve, disburse to Assumptor the amount paid by Assumptor in completing, performing, remediating or correcting the Deferred Maintenance within thirty (30) days after (a) receipt by Noteholder of a written request from Assumptor for disbursement from the Repair and Remediation Reserve and a certification by Assumptor in a form as may be required by Noteholder that the applicable item of Deferred Maintenance has been completed in accordance with the terms of this Assumption, (b) delivery to Noteholder of invoices, receipts or other evidence satisfactory to Noteholder verifying the costs of the Deferred Maintenance to be reimbursed, and (c) delivery to Noteholder of affidavits, lien waivers or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Noteholder showing that all materialmen, laborers, subcontractors and any other parties who might or could claim statutory or common law liens and are furnishing or have furnished materials or labor to the Property have been paid all amounts due for such labor and materials furnished to the Property. Noteholder shall not be required to make advances from the Repair and Remediation Reserve more frequently than once in any thirty (30) day period. In making any payment from the Repair and Remediation Reserve, Noteholder shall be entitled to rely on such request from Assumptor without any inquiry into the accuracy, validity or contestability of any such amount. Assumptor hereby grants to Noteholder, as additional security for payment of the indebtedness secured hereby, a security interest in the Repair and Remediation Reserve. The Repair and Remediation Reserve shall not, unless otherwise explicitly required by applicable law, bear interest or be deemed to be escrow or trust funds, but at Noteholder’s option and in Noteholder’s discretion, may either be held in a separate account or be commingled by Noteholder with the general funds of Noteholder. The Repair and Remediation Reserve is solely for the protection of Noteholder and entails no responsibility on Noteholder’s part beyond the payment of the costs and expenses described in this paragraph in accordance with the terms hereof and beyond the allowing of due credit for the sums actually received. . In the event that the amounts on deposit or available in the Repair and Remediation Reserve are inadequate to pay the costs of the Deferred Maintenance, Assumptor shall pay the amount of such deficiency. Upon assignment of the Loan Documents by Noteholder, any funds in the Repair and Remediation Reserve shall be turned over to the assignee and any responsibility of Noteholder, as assignor, with respect thereto shall terminate. If there is a default hereunder or under the other Loan Documents which is not cured within any applicable grace or cure period, Noteholder may, but shall not be obligated to, apply at any time the balance then remaining in the Repair and Remediation Reserve against the indebtedness secured hereby in whatever order Noteholder shall subjectively determine. No such application of the Repair and Remediation Reserve shall be deemed to cure any default hereunder. Upon the earlier to occur of full payment of the indebtedness secured hereby in accordance with its terms, the completion of the Deferred Maintenance to the satisfaction of Noteholder or at such earlier time as Noteholder may elect, the balance of the Repair and Remediation Reserve then in Noteholder’s possession shall be paid over to Assumptor and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. 

^**Replacement Reserve**. As additional security for the indebtedness secured by the Deed of Trust, Assumptor shall establish and maintain at all times while the Deed of Trust continues in effect a reserve (the “Replacement Reserve”) with Noteholder for payment of costs and expenses incurred by Assumptor in connection with the performance of work to the roofs, chimneys, gutters, carpet, appliances, landscaping, signs, downspouts, paving, curbs, ramps, driveways, balconies, porches, patios, exterior walls, exterior doors and doorways, windows, elevators and mechanical and HVAC equipment and such other items as the Noteholder may approve from time to time (collectively, the “Repairs”). Commencing on the first monthly payment date under the Note which occurs after the Closing Date and continuing thereafter on each monthly payment date under the Note, Assumptor shall pay to Noteholder, concurrently with and in addition to the monthly payment due under the Note and until the Note and all other indebtedness secured by the Deed of Trust is fully paid and performed, a deposit to the Replacement Reserve in an amount equal to $[[USD Value 4: Number]] per month. So long as no default hereunder or under the other Loan Documents has occurred and is continuing, all sums in the Replacement Reserve shall be held by Noteholder in the Replacement Reserve to pay the costs and expenses of the Repairs. So long as no default hereunder or under the other Loan Documents has occurred and is continuing beyond any applicable cure period as provided in the Note and/or the Loan Documents, Noteholder shall, to the extent funds are available for such purpose in the Replacement Reserve, disburse to Assumptor the amount paid by Assumptor in performing such Repairs within thirty (30) days following: (1) receipt by Noteholder of a written request from Assumptor for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve and a certification by Assumptor in a form approved in writing by Noteholder that the applicable item of Repair has been completed; (2) delivery to Noteholder of invoices, receipts or other reasonable evidence satisfactory to Noteholder, verifying the cost of performing the Repairs; (3) delivery to Noteholder of affidavits, lien waivers or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Noteholder showing that all materialmen, laborers, subcontractors and any other parties who might or could claim statutory or common law liens and are furnishing or have furnished material or labor to the Property have been paid all amounts due for labor and materials furnished to the Property; (4) delivery to Noteholder of a certification from an inspecting architect or other third party acceptable to Noteholder describing the completed Repairs and verifying the completion of the Repairs and the value of the completed Repairs: and (5) delivery to Noteholder of a new certificate of occupancy for the portion of the Improvements (as defined in the Deed of Trust) covered by such Repairs, if said new certificate of occupancy is required by applicable law, or a certification by Assumptor that no new certificate of occupancy is required. Noteholder shall not be required to make advances from the Replacement Reserve more frequently than once in any thirty (30) day period or in amounts less than $[[USD Value 5: Number]]. In making any payment from the Replacement Reserve, Noteholder shall be entitled to rely on such request from Assumptor without any inquiry into the accuracy, validity or contestability of any such amount. Noteholder may, at Assumptor’s expense, make or cause to be made during the term of the Deed of Trust an annual inspection of the Property to determine the need, as determined by Noteholder in its reasonable judgment, for further Repairs of the Property. In the event that such inspection reveals that further Repairs of the Property are required, Noteholder shall provide Assumptor with a written description of the required Repairs and Assumptor shall complete such Repairs to the reasonable satisfaction of Noteholder within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such description from Noteholder, or such later date as may be approved by Noteholder in its sole discretion.

At Noteholder’s option and in Noteholder’s discretion, the Replacement Reserve funds may either be held in a separate account or be commingled by Noteholder with the general funds of Noteholder. The Replacement Reserve is solely for the protection of Noteholder and entails no responsibility on Noteholder’s part beyond the payment of the costs and expenses described in this Section in accordance with the terms hereof and beyond the allowing of due credit for the sums actually received. In the event that the amounts on deposit or available in the Replacement Reserve are inadequate to pay the cost of the Repairs, Assumptor shall pay the amount of such deficiency. Upon assignment of this Deed of Trust by Noteholder, any funds in the Replacement Reserve shall be turned over to the assignee and any responsibility of Noteholder, as assignor, with respect thereto shall terminate. If there is a default under the Deed of Trust which is not cured within any applicable grace or cure period, Noteholder may, but shall not be obligated to, apply at any time the balance then remaining in the Replacement Reserve against the indebtedness secured by the Deed of Trust hereby in whatever order Noteholder shall subjectively determine. No such application of the Replacement Reserve shall be deemed to cure any default under the Deed of Trust. Upon full payment of the indebtedness secured hereby in accordance with its terms or at such earlier time as Noteholder may elect, the balance of the Replacement Reserve then in Noteholder’s possession shall be paid over to Assumptor and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto**.**
