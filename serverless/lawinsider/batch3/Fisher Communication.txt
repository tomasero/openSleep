Newly hired employees who are added as participants to the Plan during the year may receive prorated incentive awards as recommended by the CEO and approved by the Committee. 

**Plan Performance Measures and Weights** 

Performance measures are established before the end of the first quarter of the Plan period. 

Performance measures for all of the above employees will consist of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the incentive based on Company Financial Performance or Fisher’s Adjusted EBITDA (which may be adjusted for certain circumstances by the Compensation Committee) and [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the incentive based on the achievement of individual objectives. 

Award payments for Adjusted EBITDA component will be based on the Payout as a Percent of Target which corresponds to the EBITDA achievement as a percent of target. The EBITDA payout will be calculated as follows: Payout as a percent of target x participant’s target bonus percent x [[Percentage 1]]%. 

The individual objectives component is based on a pool that also varies by the EBITDA achievement. The minimum funding level for the pool is .8 x sum of participants’ target bonus x [[Percentage 2]]%. The pool funding increases with levels of EBITDA achievement such that the pool is funded at [[Percentage 3: Number]]% of the target opportunity at [[Percentage 3]]% EBITDA achievement and [[Percentage 4: Number]]% at [[Percentage 4]]% EBITDA achievement. Above [[Percentage 4]]% EBITDA achievement the pool increases [[Percentage 5: Number]]% for every [[Percentage 6: Number]]% increase in EBITDA achievement. For example, if EBITDA achievement is [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of target, the individual objectives pool is [[Percentage 8: Number]]%. If EBITDA achievement is [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of target or higher, the individual pool is [[Percentage 10: Number]]% of the target pool. Individual awards will vary based on individual performance. The sum of all individual awards will not exceed the total pool.

**Award Schedule** 

At the beginning of the Plan year, a performance/payout schedule will be developed that specifies threshold, target, and maximum Company financial performance levels and the corresponding percentage of the target award that would be earned for each performance level. Additionally, individual objectives are developed and approved by the CEO. 

**Target Incentive Awards** 

Target incentive awards are expressed as a percentage of base salary and vary by position level and accountabilities. 

**Payment of Awards** 

^participant’s payout is calculated as follows: 

      Confirm target opportunity as % of base salary

      Assess level of Company financial performance versus target performance

      Assess level of individual objective performance versus target performance

      Determine payout as a percent of target for Company financial and individual performance results

The award will be paid out at the normal payout date or earlier, at the discretion of the Committee.
