^^Termination of Service. A Holder’s Option shall immediately terminate and be cancelled upon Termination of Service of such Holder, except as otherwise provided herein or in the Award Agreement with such Holder.

^^The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding determined by the General Partner to be required by law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the General Partner may, in its discretion, require an Holder to pay to the Company at such time as the General Partner determines the amount that the General Partner deems necessary to satisfy the Company’s obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the vesting or exercise of any Award. 

\centered **REGULATIONS AND APPROVALS.** 

^^The obligation of the Company to issue Units with respect to an Award granted under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the General Partner.

^^Each grant of Awards is subject to the requirement that, if at any time the General Partner determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Units issuable pursuant to the Plan is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance of Awards, no issuance of Units shall be made in whole or in part, unless listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been effected or obtained free of any conditions in a manner acceptable to the General Partner. 

^^In the event that the disposition of Units acquired pursuant to the Plan is not covered by a then current registration statement under the Securities Act, and is not otherwise exempt from such registration, such Units shall be restricted against transfer to the extent required under the Securities Act, and the General Partner may require any individual receiving Units pursuant to the Plan, as a condition precedent to receipt of such Units, to represent to the Company in writing that such Units will be disposed of only if registered for sale under the Securities Act or if there is an available exemption for such disposition. 

\centered **INTERPRETATION AND AMENDMENTS, OTHER RULES.** 

^^The General Partner may make such rules and regulations and establish such procedures for the administration of the Plan as it deems appropriate.

Unless otherwise expressly provided hereunder or under the Award Agreement, the General Partner, with respect to any grant, may exercise its discretion hereunder at the time of the grant or thereafter. In the event of any dispute or disagreement as to the interpretation of the Plan or of any rule, regulation or procedure, or as to any question, right or obligation arising from or related to the Plan, the decision of the General Partner shall be final and binding upon all persons. The General Partner may amend the Plan as it shall deem advisable, except that no amendment, other than an amendment resulting from an amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement as described in Section 5.2, may adversely affect an Holder with respect to an Award previously granted without the Holder’s consent, unless such amendments are required in order to comply with applicable laws. 

\centered **CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE; CERTAIN CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.** 

^^Changes in Capital Structure. In the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, equity split, spin-off, split-off, split-up, issuance of equity rights, combination of units or other securities, merger, consolidation or any other change in the structure of the Company or any other event which in the judgment of the General Partner necessitates action by way of adjusting the terms of the outstanding Awards or the Units, then the General Partner, in its full discretion, shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of Units authorized for use under the Plan and any adjustments to outstanding Awards as it determines appropriate. The adjustments to outstanding Awards shall include, but not be limited to, the number of Units covered, the respective prices and/or limitations applicable to the outstanding Awards. No fractional Units shall be issued pursuant to such an adjustment. The Fair Market Value of any fractional Units resulting from adjustments pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall, where appropriate, be paid in cash to the Holder. The determinations and adjustments made by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall be conclusive. 

^^Approved Sale. In the event of an Approved Sale, unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, the General Partner, at its election may take any of the following actions with respect to an outstanding Award: 

^^accelerate the vesting of such Award and terminate the Award immediately prior to the date of any such transaction, provided that the Holder shall have been given at least twenty (20) days written notice of such transaction and of the General Partner’s intention to cancel any Options that remain unexercised; 

^^terminate the Award immediately prior to the date of any such transaction, provided, the Holder shall have been given at least twenty (20) days written notice of such transaction and of the General Partner’s intention to cancel any Options that remain unexercised; 

^^cancel any Options that remain unexercised immediately before such transaction in exchange for a payment in cash of an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Units over the Exercise Price for such Option. If the Fair Market Value of the Units subject to the Option is less than the Option’s Exercise Price, the Award shall be canceled with no further payment due the Holder; 

^^require that the Award be assumed by the successor entity or that Awards for shares or other interests in the successor entity with equivalent Fair Market Value be substituted for such Award; or 

^^take such other action as the General Partner shall determine to be reasonable under the circumstances to permit the Holder to realize the Fair Market Value of the Award. 

The application of the foregoing provisions, including, without limitation, the issuance of any substitute Awards, shall be determined in good faith by the General Partner in its sole discretion. Any adjustment may provide for the elimination of fractional Units. In taking any action described above, the General Partner may in its discretion determine that the value of a Award equals the excess of the fair market value of the consideration to be received in the merger, consolidation, combination, sale, reorganization, liquidation or Approved Sale had the Award been exercised with respect to such Units immediately prior thereto, over the Award exercise price of such Award, or such lesser amount as the General Partner may determine, including, in the case of an unvested Award, or portion thereof, determining a value of zero. 

For purposes of this Section 11.2, Fair Market Value shall be determined taking into account an allocable share of any indemnity or other expenses to which Limited Partners are subject under the Limited Partnership Agreement. 

^^Qualified Public Offering. In the event of a Qualified Public Offering, as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner, in its discretion, may, but shall not be required to, accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of the then unvested options. 

^^General Partner Authority. 

The judgment of the General Partner with respect to any matter referred to in this Section 11 shall be conclusive and binding upon each Holder without the need for any amendment to the Plan. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS.** 

^^No Rights to Employment or Other Service. Nothing in the Plan or in any grant made pursuant to the Plan shall confer on any individual any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Company or its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or its Subsidiaries and its shareholders to terminate the individual’s employment or other service at any time. 

^^No Fiduciary Relationship. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall create or shall be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or its Subsidiaries, or their officers or the General Partner, on the one hand, and the Holder, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other person or entity, on the other. 

^^Notices. All notices under the Plan shall be in writing, and if to the Company, shall be delivered to the General Partner or mailed to its principal office, addressed to the attention of the General Partner; and if to the Holder, shall be delivered personally, sent by facsimile transmission or mailed to the Holder at the address appearing in the records of the Company. Such addresses may be changed at any time by written notice to the other party given in accordance with this Section 13.3. 

^^Exculpation and Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless any “Covered Person” as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement, from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by such persons as a result of any act or omission to act in connection with the performance of such person’s duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Plan, in accordance with Section 5.3 of the Limited Partnership Agreement. 

^^Captions. The use of captions in this Plan is for convenience. The captions are not intended to provide substantive rights.
