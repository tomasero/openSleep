\centered RECITALS 

^Lessee and the Emerald Lessors entered into that certain Master Lease Agreement dated [[Date 2: Date]], whereby Lessee leased from the Emerald Lessors certain premises (the “Florida Facilities”) designated in said Master Lease Agreement and known as the Golfview Healthcare Center, St. Petersburg, Florida; Golfcrest Healthcare Center, Hollywood, Florida; Cedar Hills Healthcare Center, Jacksonville, Florida; and Southern Pines Healthcare Center, New Port Richey, Florida, which Master Lease Agreement has been amended by First Amendment to Master Lease Agreement dated [[Date 3: Date]] and Second Amendment to Master Lease Agreement dated [[Date 4: Date]] (as so amended, the “Existing Lease”). The Sublessees currently lease each of the Facilities from the Lessee pursuant to separate Subleases each dated as of [[Date 2]] (the “Subleases”), which Subleases are co-terminus with the Existing Master Lease. 

^In connection with the execution of the Existing Lease on [[Date 2]]: 

^^^Lessee, the Sublessees, the Emerald Lessors, Omega and certain affiliates of the Lessee made and entered into the collateral security documents of even date therewith listed and described on Schedule 1 attached hereto (each an “Existing Lease Security Document” and collectively the “Existing Lease Security Documents”); 

^^^Lessee, the Sublessees, the Replacement Lessor and certain affiliates of Lessee made and entered into the Amended and Restated Master Lease Agreement dated as of [[Date 2]] (the “Replacement Lease”) and the collateral security documents of even date therewith (the “Replacement Lease Security Documents”) listed and described on Schedule 2 attached hereto, whereby, if and in the event Omega were to foreclose upon, or accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure upon, its mortgage of the Facilities (an “Omega Foreclosure”), the Existing Lease and Existing Lease Security Documents would automatically and without further action be 

^^^^^ 
amended and restated in their entirety as set forth in, and would be replaced by, the Replacement Lease and Replacement Lease Security Documents; and 

^^^Lessee, the Sublessee, Omega and certain affiliates of Lessee entered into certain Security Documents each dated as of [[Date 2]] as listed and described on Schedule 3 attached hereto as collateral security for the payment of any funds advanced by Omega to Lessee pursuant to that certain Working Capital Loan Agreement dated as of [[Date 5: Date]]. The obligation of Omega to advance funds to Lessee and Sublessees under the Working Capital Loan Agreement expired on [[Date 3]] and there is no outstanding indebtedness of Lessee or Sublessees to Omega thereunder. 

^OHI has taken title to the Facilities and, pursuant to an Assignment of Lease dated [[Date 6: Date]], is the assignee of all of the right, title and interest of the Emerald Lessors in and to the Existing Lease and all documents which evidence, secure and otherwise relate to the Existing Lease. 

^Pursuant to the Second Amendment to Master Lease dated as of [[Date 4]] made by and between Lessee and OHI, the term of the Existing Lease was extended to the earlier of (i) [[Date 7: Date]] or (ii) the date that a new tenant is prepared and authorized to take over and operate all of the Facilities covered by the Existing Lease. 

^On the Effective Date (as defined below), OHI will enter into a lease agreement, or lease agreements, with a new tenant pursuant to which such new tenant will lease all the Facilities covered by the Existing Lease and, in connection therewith, Lessee and the Sublessees will transfer operational control of the Facilities to a new operator designated by such new tenant. 

^Lessee, the Sublessees, OHI, Replacement Lessor and Omega hereby desire to terminate the Existing Lease and Subleases, the Replacement Lease and other documents as set forth on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants of the parties set forth herein, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

Further as of the Effective Date, each of the Existing Lease Security Documents listed and described on Schedule 1 attached hereto are terminated.
