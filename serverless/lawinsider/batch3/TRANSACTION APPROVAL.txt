**NOW, THEREFORE**, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

^**Representations of the Stockholders**. Each Stockholder represents and warrants to the Company, as to himself, that (i) he lawfully owns beneficially (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and of record the number of shares of Common Stock set forth opposite his name on Exhibit A free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, security interests or other encumbrances and, except for this Agreement, there are no voting trusts or voting agreements with respect to such shares, (ii) he does not beneficially own any Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company other than the shares set forth on **Exhibit A**, (iii) he has full power and authority to vote all of the shares of Common Stock set forth on Exhibit A and to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform fully his obligations hereunder, and (iv) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by him, constitutes his legal, valid and binding obligation, and is enforceable against him in accordance with its terms.

^**Agreement to Vote Shares**. Each Stockholder agrees, as to himself, that he will vote the shares of Common Stock held of record or beneficially by him (including the shares set forth opposite his name on Exhibit A and any New Company Securities (as defined in Section 4 hereof)), or will, if applicable, cause any holder of record of the shares of Common Stock owned beneficially by him (including, any New Company Securities), to vote the shares of Common Stock and New Company Securities at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which such matters are considered and at every adjournment thereof and in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company (including, without limitation, the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company): (a) in favor of consummation of the Transactions and all actions necessary to facilitate the consummation of the Transactions, (b) in favor of an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to at least 149,669,463, (c) in favor of approving the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Company Convertible Debt (including, in each case, any shares issuable as a result of antidilution adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Company Convertible Debt) or as otherwise contemplated by the terms of the Notes and Warrants, (d) against any action or agreement that would result, or would be reasonably likely to result, in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of the Company under the Exchange Agreement or the Convertible Note and (e) against any action or agreement contrary to those set forth in this Section 2. Each Stockholder will retain the right to vote his Common Stock, in his sole discretion, on all matters other than those described in this Section 2 or shall grant a proxy in a form approved by the Company to vote the matters described in this Section 2, and each Stockholder may grant proxies and enter into voting agreements or voting trusts for the Common Stock in respect of such other matters.

C.G. ______ 
D.H. ______

^**Transfer and Encumbrance**. From the date hereof until after the completion of the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company (or any adjournments thereof) at which the matters set forth in Section 2 above are considered, or such later date upon which the Transactions are approved by the stockholders of the Company, each Stockholder agrees not to transfer, sell, offer, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Common Stock or any New Company Securities held by him, unless the transferee agrees in written form satisfactory to the Company to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as if such transferee were a signatory to this Agreement, or to grant any other voting rights with respect thereto or enter into any other agreement or arrangement regarding the voting thereof.

^**Additional Purchases**. Each Stockholder agrees that any Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company purchased or otherwise acquired by him after the date of execution of this Agreement ("**New Company Securities**") shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if they had been owned by him on the date hereof.

^**Specific Performance**. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by this Agreement, that every such obligation is material and that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law for damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law for damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with any other party’s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

^**Capacity of Stockholders**. Each Stockholder has executed this Agreement solely in such Stockholder’s capacity as a securityholder of the Company and not in such Stockholder’s capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect any actions taken by such Stockholder in such Stockholder’s capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its affiliates.

^**Entire Agreement**. As among the Stockholders and the Company, this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

^**Notice**. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party to the others shall be deemed given if in writing and delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or overnight courier (providing proof of delivery), postage prepaid, or by facsimile (which is confirmed):
