^\centered **DEFINITIONS**

^^**Defined Terms**. The capitalized terms in this Amendment will have the same meaning as defined within the Purchase Agreement.

^\centered **PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES**

^^**Purchase Price**. Buyer hereby purchases and Seller hereby sells to Buyer the Remaining Shares. The Parties agree that the purchase price for the Remaining Shares (the “**Option Exercise Price**”) shall be $[[USD Value 1: Number]] based on 1.5 times CPI’s revenues of $[[USD Value 2: Number]] for the twelve months ended [[Date 3: Date]], multiplied by 49 percent. This sum of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] shall be paid to Seller as follows:

^The note payable by CPI to Buyer in the amount of $[[USD Value 4: Number]] (the “**CPI Note**”) shall be applied and credited in full as a partial payment of the Option Exercise Price. The CPI Note shall be marked “Paid in Full” and delivered to the Seller at the Closing.

^The notes payable by CPI to Buyer for the purchase of SCRAM units (the “**Equipment Notes**”) in the aggregate amount of $[[USD Value 5: Number]] shall be applied and credited in full as a partial payment of the Option Exercise Price. The Equipment Notes shall be marked “Paid in Full” and delivered to the Seller at the Closing.

^Buyer shall assume and pay outstanding American Express Corporate Card Charges totaling $[[USD Value 6: Number]] and the same sum will be credited against the Option Exercise Price.

^Buyer shall assume and pay additional CPI and Seller debt obligations totaling $[[USD Value 7: Number]] and this amount shall be offset against the Option Exercise Price.

^Buyer shall assume and pay additional accounts payable and accrued expenses of Seller and CPI totaling $[[USD Value 8: Number]] as an offset against the Option Exercise Price.
