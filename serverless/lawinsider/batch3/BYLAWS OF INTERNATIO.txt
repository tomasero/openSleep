In the event a special meeting is requested properly by Stockholders holding not less than twenty percent of the Common Stock of the Company and such request meets all applicable requirements set forth in these By-Laws, any applicable statute, the Certificate of Incorporation and any other certificate filed pursuant to law, then either a majority of the Board of Directors, or the Chairman of the Board, or the President shall cause such a special meeting to be called in a manner consistent with applicable statute, the Certificate of Incorporation and any other certificate filed pursuant to law. A Stockholder’s written request for a special meeting shall include the information required under Article I, Section 7 or Article II, Section 9 of these By-Laws, as applicable with respect to the business and/or nominations proposed to be brought before such special meeting and the Stockholder(s) proposing such business and/or nominations at such meeting. Special meetings shall be held at such place within or without the State of New York as shall have been fixed by the Board of Directors and specified in the call thereof. Business transacted at a special meeting requested by Stockholders shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the request for meeting, provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the authority in its discretion to submit additional matters to the Stockholders, and to cause other business to be transacted, at any special meeting requested by Stockholders. 

^*Notice of Meetings.* Unless otherwise required by statute, the notice of every meeting of the Stockholders shall be in writing and shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting. Notice of a special meeting shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. A copy of the notice of any meeting shall be given personally, electronically or by mail, not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the date of the meeting, to each Stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting and to each Stockholder who, by reason of any action proposed at such meeting, is entitled by law to notice thereof. If mailed, it shall be directed to a Stockholder at his address as it appears on the record of Stockholders or, if he shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him be mailed to some other address, then directed to him at such other address. If transmitted electronically, such notice is given when directed to the Shareholder’s electronic mail address as supplied by the Shareholder to the Secretary of the Corporation or as otherwise directed pursuant to the Shareholder’s authorization or instructions. 

^*Quorum. Proxies. Voting.* Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law, at any meeting of the Stockholders there must be present in person or by proxy the holders of record of stock representing at least one-third of the number of votes entitled to be cast upon any question to be considered at the meeting in order to constitute a quorum for the determination of such question, but a less interest may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum be present, and thereupon any business may be transacted at the adjourned meeting which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law or by the By-Laws of the Corporation, a majority vote of a quorum at a meeting shall decide any question brought before such meeting. Every holder of record of stock of a class entitled to vote at a meeting shall be entitled to one vote for every share of such stock standing in his name on the books of the Corporation, and may vote either in person or by proxy.

The Secretary of the Corporation, or in his absence an Assistant Secretary, or if none be present, the appointee of the Presiding Officer of the meeting, shall act as Secretary of the meeting. 

^*Inspectors.* At each meeting of Stockholders at which Directors are to be elected the Presiding Officer shall appoint two Inspectors of Election who shall perform the duties required by the statute at that meeting and any adjournment thereof. If any Inspector shall refuse to serve, or neglect to attend at the election or his office becomes vacant, the Presiding Officer shall appoint an Inspector in his place. 

The Presiding Officer of any meeting may also appoint, at such meeting, two Inspectors with authority to count and report upon the votes cast at such meeting upon such questions (other than the election of Directors) as may be voted upon by ballot. 

Inspectors shall be sworn. 

^*Stockholders’ Meetings.* No business may be transacted at a meeting of Stockholders of the Corporation, except business properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-Laws. Nominations for the election of directors shall be properly presented at a meeting only if made in compliance with Section 9, Article II of these By-Laws. The proposal of business other than nominations for the election of directors may properly be brought before Stockholders at a meeting only if either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof or (c) otherwise properly brought before a special meeting pursuant to Article I, Section 2 of these By-Laws or brought before an annual meeting by any Stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a Stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section and on the record date for the determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section.

No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of Stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section, provided, however, that once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any Stockholder of any such business. The Presiding Officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to an annual or special meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the applicable procedure, and if such person should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and such business shall not be transacted. 

Nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and to put before such meeting any proposals so included in the Corporation’s proxy statement at his or her request.

\centered **BOARD OF DIRECTORS** 

^*Number. Election. Vacancies. Term of Office.* Within the limits provided by the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law, the Board of Directors shall determine from time to time the number of Directors who shall constitute the entire Board of Directors. Any such determination made by the Board of Directors shall continue in effect unless and until changed by the Board of Directors, but no such changes shall affect the term of any Director then in office and, in case any of the Directors then in office shall have been elected by holders of the Cumulative $[[USD Value 1: Number]] Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of the Corporation filed [[Date 2: Date]] pursuant to Section Thirty-six of the Stock Corporation law (hereafter in this Section 1 referred to as the “Certificate filed [[Date 2]]”), no increase in the number of Directors then in office shall be made which would reduce the number of Directors then in office elected as aforesaid to less than one-third (or the nearest whole number thereto) of the total number of Directors then in office. The Board of Directors shall from time to time make such determinations pursuant to this Section 1 as shall be necessary or appropriate in order to ensure that, under any circumstances, the holders of each series of the Serial Preferred Stock shall be able, giving effect to all applicable provisions of the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, and of these By-Laws (including, without limitation, the preceding sentence), duly and effectively to exercise any exclusive right conferred upon them by the Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate filed pursuant to law to elect Directors of the Corporation. 

Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law, at each annual meeting of the Stockholders, the successors to the class of Directors whose terms shall then expire, up to the number determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions and with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law, in a contested election, shall be elected by ballot or by proxy by the holders of the Common Stock by a plurality of the votes cast at such election. 

In any non-contested election of directors, any incumbent director who fails to receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast by ballot or by proxy by the holders of the Common Stock for his or her re-election, shall immediately tender his or her resignation, and the Board of Directors will decide, through a process managed by the Governance Committee and excluding the nominee in question, whether to accept the resignation at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting. Unless the Board determines in its judgment that it is in the best interests of the Company for the director to remain on the Board, the Board shall accept the resignation. The Board’s explanation of its decision not to accept the resignation shall be disclosed on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Except as otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, any vacancy in the Board occurring during the year, occurring as a result of an increase in the number of Directors who shall constitute the Board or any other vacancy, may be filled only by the vote of the Board provided that a quorum is then in office and present, or by a majority of the Directors then in office, if less than a quorum is then in office or by a sole remaining Director. Any vacancy in the Board occurring during the year with respect to Directors who may have been elected by holders of the Cumulative $[[USD Value 1]] Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate filed [[Date 2]] may only be filled by the holders of the Cumulative $[[USD Value 1]] Preferred Stock at a special meeting of such holders in the same manner as at an annual meeting. 

Except as otherwise provided by statute, or in the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate filed pursuant to law, the term of office of each Director heretofore or hereafter elected shall be from the time of his election and qualification until the next annual meeting following his election and until his successor shall have been duly elected and shall have qualified. 

Directors need not be Stockholders. 

^*Resignations.* Any Director may resign his office at any time by delivering his resignation in writing to the Corporation, and the acceptance of such resignation, unless required by the terms thereof, shall not be necessary to make such resignation effective. 

^*Method of Electing Entirely New Board.* In case the entire Board of Directors shall die or resign, any Stockholder may call a special meeting in the same manner that the Chairman of the Board may call such meeting, and Directors for the unexpired terms may be elected at any such special meeting in the manner provided for their election at annual meetings. 

^*Powers.* Except as provided by law, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or other certificate of the Corporation filed pursuant to law, or by these By-Laws, the powers, business and affairs of the Corporation shall be exercised and managed by the Board of Directors. 

^*Meetings.* Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such regular intervals and at such fixed time and place as from time to time may be determined by the Board, and no notice of such meetings shall be required. 

Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by direction of the Chairman of the Board, or of a Vice Chairman of the Board, or of the President, or of any two of the Directors for the time being in office. 

The Secretary shall give notice of each special meeting by mailing the same not later than the second day before the meeting, or personally or by telegraphing or telephoning the same not later than the day before the meeting, to each Director, but such notice may be waived by any Director. The Chairman of the Board, or in his absence, the President, or in his absence, a Vice Chairman (to be designated by the persons present at the meeting in the event of more than one Vice Chairman being present) shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors. If all of the aforesaid officers be absent or decline to act, the persons present may choose one of their number to act as chairman of the meeting.

Any one or more members of the Board of Directors or any Committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors of such Committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other at the same time. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. 

^*Quorum.* One-third of the total number of Directors determined pursuant to Section 1 of this Article as constituting the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but if there shall be less than a quorum at any meeting of the Board, a majority of those present (or if only one be present, then that one) may adjourn the meeting from time to time and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. 

^*Committees.* The Board of Directors may appoint an Executive Committee and such other committee or committees as they may determine. Such committee or committees shall have such powers as shall be specified by resolution of the Board of Directors. The Executive Committee, so far as permitted by law, may be vested with all of the powers of the Board of Directors when the Board of Directors is not in session. One-third of the total number of Directors appointed to a Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. 

^*Compensation of Directors.* Directors shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for their services. They may be paid a fixed salary and may also receive a fee for attendance at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any Committee of the Board. The amount of compensation shall be determined by resolution of the Board. Nothing herein contained shall preclude any Director from serving in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
