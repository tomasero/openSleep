The Operator shall invoice the Owner on a monthly basis and the Owner shall pay each such invoice within 20 days of its receipt thereof, provided that for so long as the Operator has accounts payable owing to the Owner under this Agreement or any other contract or arrangement with the Owner (including the supply of electricity to the Operator), the Owner will set off the amount payable by the Owner under this Agreement against those accounts payable by the date on which the relevant account payable from the Operator is due. 

^^SHARED SERVICES 

^^**Overview**

The Operator shall provide the Shared Services in accordance with Schedule 4 and the Annual Operating Plan. 

^^**Common Systems**

The Operator will manage, operate and maintain the Common Systems as if they are part of the Utility Plant for the purposes of the Operation Phase Services and the Annual Operating Plan. Any Sustaining Capital will be to the Operator’s account for any Common Systems that are not NSPI Assets. Each Party will be responsible for Special Capital in respect of its own assets provided that with respect to Common Systems, if a Party spends Special Capital to accommodate a request of the other Party, such Special Capital will be to that other Party’s account. 

^^**Payment**

The Shared Services will be provided as part of the Operation Phase Services and consideration for the Shared Services will be paid for as part of the Operation Phase Services. 

^^**Notice of Rights**

The Owner shall be entitled to affix notices, labels or markings to any Common System, or otherwise mark the Common Systems, to alert and notify third parties of the Owner’s rights in and to the Common Systems. 

^^STEAM, CONDENSATE AND SHARED SERVICES 

^^**Overview**

The Operator may use steam, condensate, Shared Services and Common Systems from the Utility Plant in accordance with Schedule 10. 

^^**Construction**

The Owner shall bear the costs of all interconnecting pipe, steam, condensate and compressed air lines, instrumentation, controls, power and communication cabling (the **“Steam and Condensate Fixtures”**) all up to the Steam Points of Delivery, the Condensate Points of Delivery and the Common Systems delivery points as set out in the Construction Contract. 

^^**Operation and Maintenance**

The Operator will operate and maintain the Steam and Condensate Fixtures as part of the Operation Phase Services. 

^^**Benchmark**

The Operator will identify quantifiable measures on an hourly averaged basis for pressure, temperature and mass flow, and on a suitable (less than hourly) basis for tolerance on pressure, based on the average for those measures for the Operator’s Mill prior to the commissioning of the Utility Plant in accordance with the Construction Contract (the “**Steam Benchmark**”). On an ongoing basis, the Operator will keep detailed records of steam measurements at the Steam Points of Delivery for pressure, temperature, mass flow and tolerance on pressure on an hourly averaged basis against the Steam Benchmark and will submit the records to the Joint Operating Committee for its review for accuracy. The Joint Operating Committee shall reset the Steam Benchmark from time to time to adjust for trends in variances against the Steam Benchmark. 

^^**Risk of Steam, Condensate and Compressed Air**

The Operator shall have the risk of loss of all steam, condensate and compressed air before and after the Steam Points of Delivery or Condensate Points of Delivery. Liability for all damage caused by or arising out of the steam, condensate or compressed air shall lie with the Operator, except to the extent that the damage from steam, condensate or compressed air directly arises from the Owner’s failure to pay for Sustaining Capital on the Steam and Condensate Fixtures in accordance with this Agreement. 

^^**Effect of Use of Steam**

The Operator acknowledges that its use of steam will impact the Net Output from the Utility Plant and that an under-delivery of Net Output may result in the payment of Liquidated Damages or other damages. 

^^DISENGAGEMENT SERVICES 

^^**Overview**

The purpose of the Disengagement Services is to ensure a smooth transition of the Services to the Owner or its Designee and to ensure that to the extent that the Operator’s Mill is in operation, the Operator continues to receive such steam as is necessary to operate the Operator’s Mill at the Steam Benchmark standard, and the Parties each continue to receive the applicable Shared Services. During the Disengagement Phase, the Operator will provide the Disengagement Services in accordance with the Disengagement Plan and the instructions of the Owner from time to time. 

^^**Operation Phase Services**

During the Disengagement Phase, the Operator will continue to provide all Operation Phase Services and/or Transition Phase Services (as the case may be), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but subject to the terms of the Disengagement Plan. 

^^**First Disengagement Plan**

The Operator will prepare the Disengagement Plan during the Transition Phase and submit it to the Joint Operating Committee for its review and approval. Within thirty (30) days of the Joint Operating Committee’s receipt of a proposed Disengagement Plan, the Joint Operating Committee shall provide written comments to the Operator with respect thereto and request any additions, changes or modifications to such Plan, which changes and modifications shall be prepared in accordance with Good Utility Practice and the requirements of this Agreement. All required and suggested changes to the proposed Disengagement Plan shall be provided by the Joint Operating Committee to the Operator for its review and shall be made by the Operator within fifteen (15) days following Operator’s receipt of the comments on the proposed Disengagement Plan. Once approved by the Joint Operating Committee, the Disengagement Plan shall be submitted to the Owner for final acceptance. The Owner and the Operator shall use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement thereon within ninety (90) days of the original submission to the Joint Operating Committee. If the Owner and the Operator cannot agree by the end of the Stub Period, any dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Article 21.0. 

^^**Contents of Disengagement Plan**

The Disengagement Plan will specify the tasks, the resources and the personnel to be used to (a) effect a smooth transition of the Services and any necessary Common System assets from the Operator to the Owner or the Designee and (b) ensure both a continued supply of steam at the Steam Benchmark standard to the Operator’s Mill and, at the option of the Owner a continued supply of Fuel to the Utility Plant, and will: 

**8.4.1**   Specify the processes and procedures to give effect to the seamless migration of responsibility for the provision of the Services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

**8.4.2**   Include a detailed description of the following:

^^^the management structure and roles and responsibilities of the personnel to be used for the Disengagement Services;

^^^hand-over plans for the delivery and/or return of any relevant Owner materials and other assets;

^^^the tasks to be performed to effect a smooth transition;

The Joint Operating Committee will perform such other functions as may be identified in the Plans from time to time. 

^^BUDGETING AND EXPENSES 

^^**Annual Budget**

No later than ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of each Operational Year the Operator will develop in consultation with the Owner’s Representative, an estimate of the Sustaining Capital required to maintain the Utility Plant and to meet the Steam Benchmark in the next Operational Year and shall submit the Annual Budget to the Owner for review. The Annual Budget shall: 

**12.1.1**   be prepared in accordance with the balance principle in section 12.9;

**12.1.2**   be prepared on a Through-Life Basis in respect of the Facility;

**12.1.3**   be itemized on a monthly cash flow basis; and

**12.1.4**   incorporate all proposed Budgeted Expenses.

^^**Annual Budget Review**

Within thirty (30) days of the Owner’s receipt of a proposed Annual Budget, the Owner shall provide written comments to the Operator with respect thereto and request any additions, changes or modifications to such Annual Budget, acting reasonably, which changes and modifications shall reflect the requirements of sections 12.1.1 to 12.1.3. All required and suggested changes to the proposed Annual Budget shall be provided by the Owner to the Operator for its review and shall be made by the Operator within fifteen (15) days following Operator’s receipt of the comments on the proposed Annual Budget. Owner and Operator shall use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement thereon by the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the applicable Operational Year. If the Owner and the Operator cannot agree as to the reasonableness of the Owner’s requested changes, any dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Article 21.0 . 

^^**Budget Overruns**

If, at any time during the performance of the Services, the Operator reasonably anticipates that the aggregate costs for any Operational Year of Sustaining Capital may exceed the amount of Budgeted Expenses therefor, the Operator shall promptly advise the Owner of such situation by Notice, and pursuant to Section 12.5, propose for the Owner’s approval any changes to the applicable Annual Budget which the Operator considers necessary. The Owner will act reasonably in considering any request. 

^^**Limitations**

Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 12.3, the Owner will not bear any costs other than those Budgeted Expenses incurred in accordance with the Annual Budget as it may be amended from time to time. The Operator shall have no authority, without the prior written approval of the Owner, to undertake any transaction or incur any expenditure in the name of, or on behalf of the Owner. Any costs or expenses incurred by the Operator in connection with any such unapproved transaction shall be solely for the account of the Operator. 

^^**Revisions**

At the request of the Owner, the Operator shall update the applicable Annual Budget at such times as may be appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions made in its preparation which are desirable in the light of the performance of the Utility Plant or any other material change in circumstance or in the assumptions used to develop such Annual Budget, such as Changes of Law. These updates shall be submitted to the Owner for its written approval. In addition, to reflect such changes the Operator may, at any time, provide proposed revisions to any Annual Budget to the Owner for consideration. Unless otherwise specified by the Owner, such revisions shall become effective for purposes of this Agreement from the date of the Owner’s written approval thereof (if approved). 

^^**Disputes Regarding Annual Budget**

If there is any dispute between the Operator and the Owner as to the form or content of any Annual Budget, or any amendments, changes or revisions thereto, which the Parties fail to resolve within the time periods for resolution set forth in Section 12.2: 

**12.6.1**   The Owner shall be entitled to direct the Operator to perform in accordance with the relevant Annual Budget concerning the matter in dispute in the form and content desired by the Owner provided that the Operator is able to comply with all Applicable Laws and Good Utility Practice and there is no material adverse impact on the Operator’s Mill or its operations; and

**12.6.2**   To the extent the Operator’s ability to perform the Services in accordance with this Agreement is materially adversely affected as a result of the Owner’s failure to approve the relevant Annual Budget (or any revision of modification thereto), the Operator shall not be held in breach of this Agreement, and shall not be liable to the Owner for any loss suffered or incurred by the Owner as a consequence thereof; provided that (i) any such Damage is a direct result (whether solely or in part) of the Owner’s failure to approve such Annual Budget or any revision thereto, and (ii) the Operator uses reasonable commercial efforts to comply with the requirements of this Agreement notwithstanding such dispute.

**12.6.3**   Any disputed item under this Section 12.6 shall be resolved pursuant to Article 21.

^^**Additional Capital Expenditures**

The Owner, or its Designee with the Owner’s consent, shall have the right to request the Operator to incur additional capital expenditures beyond the total Budgeted Expenses for a Operational Year, as long as the Owner pays the associated cost. 

^^**Five-Year Forecast**

In conjunction with, but separate from, the preparation of the Annual Operating Plan and the Annual Budget for each Operational Year, Operator shall prepare a rolling five-year operation and maintenance plan and cost forecast (including Sustaining Capital and recommended Improvements or Additions). 

^^**Balance Principle**

The Parties acknowledge that a failure by one Party to incur management, operating and maintenance expenses on the one hand and Sustaining Capital on the other can have a direct economic impact on the other Party. The Parties agree that the following principle will be used to determine the balance between Sustaining Capital and management, operating and maintenance expenses: 

**12.9.1**   the Operator agrees to incur such management, operating and maintenance expenses;

**12.9.2**   the Owner agrees to invest such Sustaining Capital in the Utility Plant; and

**12.9.3**   each Party agrees to invest such Sustaining Capital in respect of its own Common Systems,

each as would reasonably be expected by a prudent operator of a co-generation utility plant owned and operated by a single entity, having regard to Good Utility Practice. 

^^CHANGE MANAGEMENT 

^^**Right to Make Changes**

The Owner, or its Designee with the Owner’s consent, shall have the right to request the Operator to make Changes, including changes or modifications to any agreed Plan, the Annual Operating Budget, the Agreed Procedures, or to undertake additional activities not required by this Agreement or by Good Utility Practice. Either Party may request a Change to the extent required to take into account a Change in Law. 

^^**Process**

Any Change will be made by way of a written change order issued and signed by the Owner. The Operator shall not undertake any such Change without receipt in advance of a change order or approval of a change order signed by the Owner. For greater certainty, any termination of this Agreement or any Service by the Owner shall not require a change order, but shall otherwise be governed by the applicable provisions of this Agreement. 

^^**Obligation to Make Changes**

The Operator must not directly or indirectly reject or refuse a Change and shall make all Changes requested by the Owner, provided that the Owner fully compensates the Operator for any incremental costs it incurs and that such change is consistent with Good Utility Practice and conforms with Applicable Laws. Indirect grounds for refusing to provide, or rejecting, a Change include imposing unreasonable conditions for, or specifying any unreasonable impact or consequences of, undertaking the Change. It is not unreasonable for the Operator to consider material effects on the Operator’s Mill when determining the cost impact of a Change. Any disputed Change that cannot be resolved within the terms of the foregoing paragraph shall be resolved pursuant to Article 21. 

^^**Change in Law**

In the event of a Change in Law, the Parties shall cooperate to make such changes as will keep the Parties on substantially the same economic terms as contained herein. 

^^ENVIRONMENT 

^^**Certification**

The Owner will obtain Certification for the Utility Plant as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of the Operation Phase. The Operator shall provide the Owner with all assistance reasonably required in connection with obtaining such Certification.

^^**Governmental Approvals**

Owner shall apply for, and obtain and maintain, all Governmental Approvals which are required under Applicable Law to be obtained and maintained by Owner to perform its obligations under this Agreement but excluding those required to be obtained and maintained by the Operator.

In all such matters, the Owner shall be bound by the written communications, directions, requests and decisions made by Owner’s Representative within the scope of such representative’s authority. 

^^**Owner’s Right to Perform Services**

If the Operator at any time fails to perform any act on its part to be performed under this Agreement, then the Owner may, but shall not be under any obligation to, and without further notice or demand upon the Operator (other than as set out further below) and without waiving or releasing the Operator from any of its obligations hereunder, perform any act on the Operator’s part. Unless immediate action is required in order to avoid harm to any Person or to the Owner’s interest in the Site, the Utility Plant, any Energy, or any Common System, the Owner shall give at least five Business Days’ prior Notice to the Operator and the Operator shall be entitled during such period to cure or produce a plan (acceptable to the Owner, acting reasonably) to cure its failure to perform. If the Owner has so accepted a plan to cure, the Operator shall diligently and in a timely fashion cure its failure to perform in accordance with such plan. In any event, the Owner shall give Notice to the Operator at the time of the performance of any act on behalf of the Operator. All sums paid by the Owner pursuant to this Section 15.7 and reasonably necessary incidental costs and expenses paid by the Owner in connection with any such act, including the reasonable costs and expenses of legal counsel, shall be paid to the 

Owner by the Operator within 35 days of demand for such payment.

^^SUBCONTRACTORS 

^^**Consent**

The Operator may not subcontract Services, other than Services consisting of the supply of Fuel, which aggregate $[[USD Value 5: Number]] or greater per Operational Year to any single non-Affiliate Subcontractor, or $[[USD Value 6: Number]] in total to all non-Affiliate Subcontractors in an Operational Year, without prior written consent of the Owner, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

^^**Subcontracts**

Each subcontract with a Subcontractor, other than Fuel subcontracts, must contain terms that are consistent with this Agreement and not in any way prejudicial to the Owner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Operator will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each such subcontract contains the following terms, expressly for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Owner: 

**18.2.1**   Subcontractor expressly waives and releases any and all rights it has under Applicable Law (including without limitation any lien rights under the *Builders’ Lien Act* (Nova Scotia)) to place a Lien on the Utility Plant or any other property of the Owner and shall undertake not to create or do any act, deed or thing which would result in the creation of any Lien on such property;

**18.2.4**   Subcontractor agrees to include in each of its own subcontracts with any sub-subcontractors the terms of this Section 18.2 to the Owner’s benefit.

In the event the Operator is unable to negotiate a subcontract including the above listed terms for a commercially reasonable price notwithstanding commercially reasonable efforts to do so, the Operator may seek the consent of the Joint Operating Committee and the Joint Operating Committee shall direct the Operator to either: (a) enter into its negotiated form of contract as shown to the Joint Operating Committee or (b) approve the additional costs directly arising from the requirement for the above clauses. 

^^**Responsibility**

In any case, the Operator is solely responsible to the Owner for the management and operations of the Utility Plant, and subcontracting the Services or any portion thereof to an affiliate or a non-Affiliate Subcontractor shall not relieve the Operator of any of its duties, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement. The Operator shall remain directly liable to the Owner for the performance of such subcontracted Services as if such services had been performed directly by the Operator and not by an Affiliate or a non-Affiliate Subcontractor.

Owner shall fully indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Operator and each of its Affiliates, and the directors, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns of each of them (the “Operator Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all Damages directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or related to third-party claims in respect of any damage to or destruction of property of, or death of or bodily injury to, any Person, (whether such person is an employee of an Operator Indemnified Party, Owner or any Subcontractor, or is a Person unaffiliated with the Project) but only to the extent caused by or contributed to by the Owner’s fault, tortuous act, negligence or strict liability in the performance of the Owner’s obligations hereunder or by any breach by the Owner of its obligations hereunder, and in any event excluding damages to the extent attributable to any matters covered by Operator’s indemnity under Section 20.3.2.

**20.3.3**   **Operator Indemnities**

Operator shall fully indemnify each of the Owner Indemnified Parties, from and against any and all Damages directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or related to:

^^**Liquidated Damages**

The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the circumstances where Liquidated Damages are payable by the Operator, the Owner will suffer financial damage in such circumstances and that such financial damage will be proximate and substantial, but the actual amount thereof will be very difficult, if not impossible to ascertain, and, accordingly, the amount, or method of determining the amount, of the Liquidated Damages is a genuine pre-estimate, or a methodology for arriving at a genuine pre-estimate, of the amount of such financial damage and shall not be considered penal. 

^^DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

^^**Step Negotiation**

In the event of a dispute regarding this Agreement, the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute amicably and promptly by appointing a senior executive of each Party to attempt to mutually agree upon a resolution. Either Party may give the other Party Notice of any dispute or claim. Within ten (10) days after delivery of said Notice, the executives will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange information and attempt to resolve the dispute or claim within thirty (30) days. If the two senior executives cannot reach a resolution, the dispute may be set for arbitration as described herein. 

^^**Third Party Technical Expert**

In the event of a dispute arising between the Parties as to the subject matter of this Agreement that cannot be resolved between them, the Parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration, unless the dispute is of a technical or engineering nature and the Parties have agreed to a technical dispute mechanism, including appointing a technical expert, in which case the dispute will be referred to the technical expert in accordance with the procedure determined by the Parties pursuant to section 21.5. 

^^**Arbitration**

Arbitration will be carried out, pursuant to the terms of the Commercial Arbitration Act (Nova Scotia). In particular, the Parties agree to utilize the arbitration procedure attached as Schedule “A” to the Commercial Arbitration Act (Nova Scotia) in the conduct of the arbitration. The Party wishing to have any dispute submitted to arbitration (the “Claimant”) shall give Notice to the other party (the “Respondent”) specifying the particulars of any issue in dispute and proposing the name of the individual it wishes to be the single arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) days thereafter, the Respondent shall give Notice to the Claimant advising whether the Respondent accepts the arbitrator proposed by the Claimant. If Notice is not given within the fifteen (15) day period, the Respondent shall be deemed to have accepted the arbitrator proposed by the Claimant. In the event that the Parties can not agree on a single arbitrator within the fifteen (15) day period, the arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Act (Nova Scotia). No such arbitrator shall have previously been employed by either Party and shall not have a direct or indirect interest in either Party or the subject matter of the arbitration. The cost of the arbitration (excluding a Party’s legal fees and disbursements) shall, unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator or the panel, be borne equally by the Parties. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and the beneficiary of any award of the arbitrator may bring proceedings in any jurisdiction to enforce the award or any judgment enforcing the award. The bringing of such proceedings in one or more jurisdictions shall not preclude the bringing of enforcement proceedings in any other jurisdiction. In connection with any such proceeding, each Party waives any right to de novo review of the award against that Party. All matters relating to any arbitration held pursuant to this Section, including the existence of the dispute and its referral to arbitration, shall be held in confidence by both Parties and disclosed only with the consent of both Parties or if required by Applicable Law. 

^^**Continued Performance**

All Services and the performance of all other obligations under this Agreement shall continue during the dispute resolution proceeding. 

^^**Technical Disputes**

As part of the Transition Phase Plan, the Parties will work together to determine a technical dispute mechanism, including appointing a technical expert, to resolve any disputes of a technical or engineering nature, including disputes regarding the effect of Draft Procedures on the Operator’s Mill, on an expedited basis. Once the process and technical expert are agreed, the Parties will refer all disputes of a technical or engineering nature to the technical expert rather than to arbitration. If the technical expert ceases to be engaged by the Parties, the Parties shall appoint a new technical expert as soon as reasonably practical. If the technical expert indicates that any dispute referred to the technical expert is beyond his or her technical expertise, he or she may recommend an alternate technical expert to the Parties, and if the Parties cannot agree on an alternate technical expert, the matter in question shall be referred to arbitration pursuant to Section 21.3. 

^^FORCE MAJEURE 

^^**Effect of Force Majeure Event**

Each Party shall be excused from performance and shall not be construed to be in default in respect of any obligation hereunder, for so long as and to the extent that failure to perform such obligation is due to a Force Majeure Event; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, a Force Majeure Event shall not excuse either Party from the obligation to make payments for any obligation. 

^^**Notice of Force Majeure Event**

If either Party desires to invoke a Force Majeure Event as a cause for delay in its performance of, or failure to perform, any obligation hereunder, it shall, as soon as is practicable but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the inability to perform due to a Force Majeure Event, give Notice to the other Party of such date and the nature and expected duration and effect of such Force Majeure Event. Promptly, but in any event within ten (10) days, after a Notice is given pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Parties shall meet (or otherwise communicate) to discuss the basis and terms upon which the arrangements set out in this Agreement shall be continued, to the extent feasible taking into account the effects of such Force Majeure Event. 

^^**Mitigation of Force Majeure Event**

Each Party suffering a Force Majeure Event shall take, or cause to be taken, such action as may be necessary to void, or nullify, or otherwise to mitigate, in all material respects, the effects of such Force Majeure Event. The Parties shall take all reasonable steps to ensure normal performance under this Agreement, including the resumption of any disrupted obligations. 

^^INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

^^**Owner Intellectual Property**

Designs, drawings, specifications, instructions, manuals and other documents created, produced or commissioned by the Owner and relating to the Utility Plant and to the carrying out of the Services at the Facility and copyright therein and all Intellectual Property Rights relating thereto (**“Owner Intellectual Property”**) are, shall be, and shall remain the property of the Owner. The Owner hereby grants to the Operator a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license to use the Owner’s Intellectual Property in connection with the providing of the Services to the Owner only.

The Operator hereby grants the Owner a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable (other than as permitted below) license to use solely with regard to the providing of Services to the Owner any Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Operator required in connection with the provision of the Services. Such license shall be irrevocable during the life of the Utility Plant and thereafter for such period as may be required to satisfy the Owner’s regulatory, record keeping and reporting obligations.

Prior to concluding any contract with any third parties relating to the supply of materials or services specifically created by third parties for the purposes of providing the Services, the Operator shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide that such third party grant irrevocable non- exclusive, royalty-free licenses to each of the Operator and the Owner to use all Intellectual Property Rights pertaining to such contract, with the right for the Owner to assign such license to, or grant a sub-license to, any person appointed operator of the Utility Plant from time to time.

**26.4.5**   For all the purposes of this Agreement (i) a change of Control shall exclude (x) a change in the ownership of shares or units of ownership that are listed on a recognized stock exchange, (y) a sale of a majority of equity ownership interest in the Parent, or (z) any change in the equity ownership of any intermediary entity between the Parent and the Operator for corporate restructuring purposes provided that the Parent remains in Control of the Operator, (ii) any mortgage, pledge, charge, grant of a security interest or other assignment for collateral security purposes of any of the Operator’s rights, title and interests in this Agreement, the Facility or the Operator’s Mill in favour of any Lender providing secured financing to or for the benefit of the Operator or any of its affiliates as obligors shall not require the consent of the Owner provided that such Lender has acknowledged in writing in favour of the Owner that its security interest is subject to the Owner’s consent rights in Sections 26.4.1, 26.4.2 and 26.4.6 (except 26.4.6(i)), which shall apply in connection with any assignment by the Lender to another Person of the rights, title and interest of the Operator or Lender in this Agreement, the Facility or the Operator’s Mill upon the realization of its security interest, (iii) an assignment of the Operator’s obligations and liabilities under this Agreement to an operating affiliate shall not require the consent of the Owner, if evidence has been provided to Owner to demonstrate, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Owner, the capability of such operating affiliate to perform and discharge the obligations and liabilities of the Operator under this Agreement and the Operator remains jointly and severally liable with such operating affiliate.

^^^the assignee’s past dealings with the Party whose consent is required or its Affiliates were acceptable to that Party acting reasonably; and

No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

^^**Independent Contractor**

The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors for the performance of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and not as an agent, representative, partner or joint venturer of each other in respect of the Project.

This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement shall be considered for all purposes as prepared through the joint efforts of the Parties and shall not be construed against one Party or the other as a result of the preparation, substitution, submission or other event of negotiation, drafting or execution hereof. 

^^**Partial Invalidity**

Wherever possible, all provisions hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, and any provision declared or rendered unlawful by any applicable court of law or regulatory agency or deemed unlawful because of a statutory change will not otherwise affect the remaining lawful obligations that arise under this Agreement, unless such a construction of the remainder of the Agreement would be unreasonable or deprive a Party of a material benefit under this Agreement. In such event, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to remove the invalid provision and replace it with a legal, valid and enforceable provision that comes as close as possible to expressing the intention of the invalid provision unless prohibited by law.
