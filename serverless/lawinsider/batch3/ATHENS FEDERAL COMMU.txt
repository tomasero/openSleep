^^**Voluntary Termination by the Executive Without Good Reason****.** In addition to his other rights to terminate his employment under this Agreement, Executive may voluntarily terminate employment during the term of this Agreement upon at least ninety (90) days prior written notice to the board of directors of the Bank. Upon Executive’s voluntary termination, he will receive only his compensation and vested rights and benefits to the date of his termination of employment.

^^^^^ 
unexpired term of this Agreement, plus an additional twelve (12) months, and in accordance with the Bank’s regular pay practices, continue to receive the Base Salary in effect at the Executive’s termination of employment. However, the Bank and the Executive acknowledge and agree that the severance benefits under this Section 4.1 shall not be payable if severance benefits are payable or shall have been paid to the Executive under Article 5 of this Agreement. 

^^If when employment termination occurs the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if the cash severance payment under Section 4.1(a) would be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and finally if an exemption from the six-month delay requirement of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code is not available, the Executive’s continued Base Salary under Section 4.1(a) for the first six months after employment termination shall be paid to the Executive in a single lump sum without interest on the first day of the seventh (7th) month after the month in which the Executive’s employment terminates and all remaining payments shall be made as originally scheduled.

^^If (x) under the terms of the applicable policy or policies for the insurance benefits specified in Section 4.2(a) it is not possible to continue coverage for the Executive and his dependents, or (y) when employment termination occurs the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, if any of the continued insurance coverage benefits specified in Section 4.2(a) would be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and finally, if an exemption from the six-month delay requirement of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code is not available for that particular insurance benefit, the Bank shall pay to the Executive in a single lump sum an amount in cash equal to the present value of the Bank’s projected cost to maintain that particular insurance benefit (and associated income tax gross-up benefit, if applicable) had the Executive’s employment not terminated, assuming continued coverage for 36 months. The lump-sum payment shall be made thirty (30) days after employment termination or, if Section 4.1(b) applies, on the first day of the seventh (7th) month after the month in which the Executive’s employment terminates.

Moreover, provided the Executive is not in breach of any obligation under Articles 6 and 7 of this Agreement, the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned or benefits provided as the result of employment of the Executive or as a result of the Executive being self-employed after employment termination. 

^^**Amendment and Waiver****.** This Agreement may not be amended, released, discharged, abandoned, changed, or modified in any manner, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor affect the validity of this Agreement or any part thereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver or any breach of this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

^^**Compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A****.** The Bank and the Executive intend that their exercise of authority or discretion under this Agreement shall comply with Section 409A of the Code. If any provision of this Agreement does not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall nevertheless be applied in a manner consistent with those requirements. If any provision of this Agreement would subject the Executive to additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the Bank shall reform the provision. However, the Bank shall maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without subjecting the Executive to additional tax or interest, and the Bank shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a result of the reformed provision. 

^^**Required Provisions****.** In the event any of the foregoing provisions of this Agreement conflict with the terms of this Section 8.10, this Section 8.10 shall prevail. 

^^The Bank’s board of directors may terminate the Executive’s employment at any time, but any termination by the Bank, other than termination for Cause, shall not prejudice the Executive’s right to compensation or other benefits under this Agreement. The Executive shall not have the right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for Cause as defined in Section 3.2 of this Agreement. 

^^If the Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank’s affairs by a notice served under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(e)(3) or (g)(1), the Bank’s obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank may, in its discretion: (i) pay the Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended; and (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of the obligations which were suspended. 

^^^^^ 
^^If the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank’s affairs by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(e)(4) or (g)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the contracting parties shall not be affected. 

^^If the Bank is in default as defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1813(x)(1), all of the Bank’s obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph shall not affect any vested rights of the contracting parties. 

^^All obligations under this Agreement shall terminate, except to the extent determined that continuation of the Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the institution: (i) by the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), or his designee, at the time the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in Section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1823(c), or (ii) by the Director of the OTS (or his designee) at the time the Director of the OTS (or his designee) approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the operations of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by the Director of the OTS to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. Any rights of the Executive that have already vested, however, shall not be affected by such action. 

^^Any payments made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to, and conditioned upon, their compliance with 12 U.S.C. Section 1828(k) and FDIC Regulation 12 C.F.R. Part 359, Golden Parachute and Indemnification Payments. 

^^**Source of Payments****.** All payments provided for under this Agreement shall be timely paid in cash or check from the general funds of the Bank. The Corporation, however, unconditionally guarantees payment and provision of all amounts and benefits due under this Agreement. In the event the Bank does not pay such amounts or provide such benefits, they shall be paid or provided by the Corporation.
