For purposes of this Section 5.3, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a different limitation from that set forth in this Section 5.3, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code. If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section 5.3, the Optionee may designate which portion of such Option the Optionee is exercising. In the absence of such designation, the Optionee shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first.

(iii) **Payment by Promissory Note.** No promissory note shall be permitted if the exercise of an Option using a promissory note would be a violation of any law. Any permitted promissory note shall be on such terms as the Board shall determine. The Board shall have the authority to permit or require the Optionee to secure any promissory note used to exercise an Option with the shares of Stock acquired upon the exercise of the Option or with other collateral acceptable to the Company. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, if the Company at any time is subject to the regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other governmental entity affecting the extension of credit in connection with the Company’s securities, any promissory note shall comply with such applicable regulations, and the Optionee shall pay the unpaid principal and accrued interest, if any, to the extent necessary to comply with such applicable regulations.    6.4 **Tax Withholding*****.*** The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable upon the exercise of an Option, or to accept from the Optionee the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to such Option or the shares acquired upon the exercise thereof.

(b) A “***Change in Control***” shall mean an Ownership Change Event or a series of related Ownership Change Events (collectively, a “***Transaction***”) wherein the stockholders of the Company immediately before the Transaction do not retain immediately after the Transaction, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company’s voting stock immediately before the Transaction, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent ([[Percentage 7]]%) of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or, in the case of a Transaction described in Section 9.1(a)(iii), the corporation or other business entity to which the assets of the Company were transferred (the “***[[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]]s or other business entities which own the Company or the [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]]s or other business entities. The Board shall have the right to determine whether multiple sales or exchanges of the voting securities of the Company or multiple Ownership Change Events are related, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.    9.2 **Effect of Change in Control on Options*****.*** In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “***Acquiring Corporation***”), may, without the consent of the Optionee, either assume the Company’s rights and obligations under outstand ing Options or substitute for outstanding Options substantially equivalent options for the Acquiring Corporation’s stock. In the event that the Acquiring Corporation does not assume or substitute for the outstanding Options, the Optionee will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options, including shares of Stock as to which such Options would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Any Options which are neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of an Option prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of the Option Agreement evid encing such Option except as otherwise provided in such Option Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the outstanding Options immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 9.1(a)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent ([[Percentage 7]]%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the outstanding Options shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion. Additionally, and notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.2 to the contrary, if an Optionee’s Service is terminated by reason of an Involuntary Termination within eighteen (18) months following the e ffective date of a Change in Control in which the Acquiring Corporation assumes or substitutes for outstanding Options, the shares of Stock subject to such Optionee’s outstanding Options will automatically accelerate and vest in full as of the Optionee’s termination of Service, including shares of Stock as to which such Options would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Any Option so accelerated shall remain exercisable until the Option’s expiration or, if earlier, the termination of the Option, as provided in the Optionee’s Option Agreement.     \centered - 10 -         10. **Provision of Information.**    At least annually, copies of the Company’s balance sheet and income statement for the just completed fiscal year shall be made available to each Optionee and purchaser of shares of Stock upon the exercise of an Option. The Company shall not be required to provide such information to key employees whose duties in connection with the Company assure them access to equivalent information. Furthermore, the Company shall deliver to each Optionee such disclosures as are required in accordance with Rule 701 under the Securities Act.    11. **Compliance with Securities Law.**    The grant of Options and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of Options shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities. Options may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Option may be exercised unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of any Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.    12. **Termination or Amendment of Plan.**    Without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, the Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time. However, subject to changes in applicable law, regulations or rules that would permit otherwise, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Section 4.2), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, (c) no extension of the term of an Option granted to an Insider, other than as provided for in Section 6.6(d), (d) no reduction in the exercise price of an Option granted to an Insider, other than in connection with adjustments for changes in the Company’s capital structure as permitted pursuant to Section 4.2 and (e) no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company’s stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule. No termination or amendment of the Plan shall adversely affect any then outstanding Option unless expressly agreed to by the affected Participant or required by applicable law, legislation or rule. In any event, no termination or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Option without the consent of the Optionee, unless such termination or amendment is required to enable an Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option or is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule.    13. **Stockholder Approval**.    The Plan or any increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock issuable thereunder as provided in Section 4.1 (the “*Authorized Shares***”) shall be approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months of the date of adoption thereof by the Board. Options granted prior to stockholder approval of the Plan or in excess of the Authorized Shares previously approved by the stockholders shall become exercisable no earlier than the date of stockholder approval of the Plan or such increase in the Auth orized Shares, as the case may be.     \centered - 11 -
