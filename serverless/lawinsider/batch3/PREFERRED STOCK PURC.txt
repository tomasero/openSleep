In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of Common Stock, if the total amount of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by the Management Holders and Purchaser exceeds the amount of securities that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the offering, then Camelot shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardi ze the success of the offering (the securities so included to be apportioned pro rata among Purchaser and the Management Holders according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included therein owned by each such selling holder).
