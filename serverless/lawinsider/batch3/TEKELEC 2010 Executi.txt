\centered **TEKELEC 2010 Executive Officer Bonus Plan** 

Tekelec (“Tekelec” or the “**Company**”) believes that a portion of each executive officer’s annual compensation should be directly related to the Company’s financial performance. The 2010 Officer Bonus Plan (“**2010 Bonus Plan**” or the “**Plan**”) is designed to motivate Tekelec’s executive officers and to reward them for their continuing contributions to the Company’s business if, in 2010, the Company achieves certain financial results. The effective date of the 2010 Bonus Plan is [[Date 1: Date]] (the “**Effective Date**”). 

2010 Bonus Plan  
Each Eligible Officer (as defined below), by virtue of his or her continuing employment with Tekelec, will be eligible to receive a 2010 1H Bonus and a 2010 Full Year bonus (referred to herein individually as “**2010 Bonus**” and collectively as “**2010 Bonuses**”) based on the Company’s financial performance as measured by the degree to which the Company achieves the following pre-set, Board of Directors-approved, financial targets for the 2010 1H, consisting of the first and second fiscal quarters of 2010, and the full 2010 fiscal year: (i) Adjusted Operating Income before Bonus, (ii) revenue, and (iii) orders. 

The 2010 Bonuses payable to an Eligible Officer will be calculated as a percentage of such Officer’s annual base salary of record in effect at the end of the period for which the bonuses are payable (the “**Salary**”). If an Eligible Officer is on a leave of absence in excess of 30 days during the 1H period or 60 days during the Full Year period, the Eligible Officer’s Salary will be calculated based on the Eligible Officer’s annualized actual earnings for the that period. In determining an Eligible Officer’s annual base salary of record or actual earnings, certain compensation and payments (e.g., reimbursement for moving expenses, bonus payments received under the 2009 Executive Officer Bonus Plan or this Plan, stock option or other equity incentive compensation, discretionary bonuses, disability benefits, sign-on bonuses, vacation cash outs, and on call pay) shall be excluded. 

For purposes of determining the amount payable as a 2010 1H Bonus for an executive officer who commences his/her employment as an Eligible Officer in the first calendar quarter of 2010, an Officer’s annual base salary will be prorated based on the ratio of (i) the number of days that an executive officer serves as an Eligible Officer during the period to (ii) 180 (such ratio shall not be greater than one). An executive officer who commences his/her employment during the second calendar quarter of 2010 will not be eligible to receive a 2010 1H Bonus. 

For purposes of determining the amount payable as a 2010 Full Year Bonus for an executive officer who commences his/her employment as an Eligible Officer in the first, second or third calendar quarters of 2010, an Officer’s annual base salary will be prorated based on the ratio of (i) the number of days that an executive officer serves as an Eligible Officer during the period to (ii) 360 (such ratio shall not be greater than one). An executive officer who commences his/her employment during the fourth calendar quarter of 2010 will not be eligible to receive a 2010 Full Year Bonus. 

This and further references to Board of Directors (“Board”) action or approval shall be interpreted as a duly adopted Board resolution following consideration and a recommendation by the Compensation Committee of the Board, if the Board accepts such recommendation, or alternatively by a duly adopted resolution of the Board based on a vote by the independent members of the Board as defined by NASDAQ rules.

Eligible Officers  
The following executive officers have been designated by the Board as “**Eligible Officers**” for purposes of the 2010 Bonus Plan and will be eligible to participate in the 2010 Bonus Plan (all titles are positions with Tekelec unless otherwise specified): 

Eligible Officers List

Chief Executive Officer & President

Executive Vice President, [[Organization 1 Name]]

Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs & General Counsel

Senior Vice President, Global Operations & Service

Vice President, Information Technology & Chief Information Officer 

^person appointed as an Executive Officer of the Company after the Effective Date shall be eligible to participate in the 2010 Bonus Plan if he/she is expressly designated by the Board as an Eligible Officer under the 2010 Bonus Plan. 

An Eligible Officer whose title changes after the Effective Date shall be entitled to participate in the 2010 Bonus Plan on the same terms and conditions as applied immediately prior to such title change unless either (i) the terms of such Eligible Officer’s participation in the 2010 Bonus Plan are changed pursuant to a duly adopted resolution of the Board; (ii) the Board amends this Plan to add the new title as an Eligible Officer in the Eligible Officer table above in which case such Officer shall participate at the bonus participation level corresponding to such new title; or (iii) as a result of the change in title, such individual is no longer an Eligible Officer. 

In order to earn and be eligible to receive bonuses payable under the 2010 Bonus Plan, an Eligible Officer must be actively employed by Tekelec or one of its subsidiaries as an Eligible Officer on the date on which such bonuses are paid, unless such requirement is waived by the Board. An Eligible Officer who is on an approved leave of absence from the Company at any time during 2010 will, for purposes of determining eligibility under the 2010 Bonus Plan, be treated as being employed by the Company during such leave of absence provided, however, that an Eligible Officer who is on an approved leave of absence from the Company on the date on which the 2010 Bonus is paid by the Company and thereafter returns to active status as an Eligible Officer upon the end of such leave of absence, will be paid his/her Company Bonus to which he/she is otherwise entitled within 30 days following his/her return to active status as an Eligible Officer. An Eligible Officer who is on an approved leave of absence from the Company on the date on which the 2010 Bonus is paid by the Company and thereafter fails to return to active status as an Eligible Officer upon the end of such leave of absence, will not be eligible to receive a 2010 Bonus. 

2010 Bonus Computation  
The Company’s consolidated operating income from continuing operations before bonus (as adjusted to exclude the effects of equity incentive compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition-related amortization and other M&A-related charges or income, and similar non-GAAP charges or income, “**Adjusted Operating Income before Bonus**”), revenue and orders will be the financial measures for calculating the amount of the Company Bonuses under the 2010 Bonus Plan. 

All payouts under the 2010 Bonus Plan are contingent upon the company performing at or above a threshold percentage of the Adjusted Operating Income before Bonus target established by the Board (“**OI Target**”). The threshold percentage is [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the OI Target, and thus for performance below [[Percentage 1]]% 

^of 5 

^^^^^ 
of the OI Target, there is no funding of a pool for payouts of a bonus. The Board will also establish performance targets for Orders and Revenue (“**Orders Target**” and “**Revenue Target**”, respectively, and together with the OI Target or individually, “**Targets**”). 

Upon Tekelec’s achievement of [[Percentage 1]]% of the Operating Income Target, the 2010 Bonuses shall be calculated as the sum of the result of one of the following computations applied to each of the Targets: 

If 1H and Full Year Performance Relative to Target is equal to or greater than [[Percentage 1]]% but all are individually less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]%, the product of A (x) B (x) C (x) T, where “A” is the Eligible Officer’s Salary, “B” is the Payout Percentage corresponding to the Performance Relative to Target in the Payout Percentage Table below, “C” is the 2010 1H or 2010 Full-Year Bonus Opportunity, as applicable, in the Bonus Participation Table below, and “T” is the Target Weighting corresponding to the Target, and the performance against such Target, in the Target Weighting Table below, provided that the calculated payment for 1H performance is capped at [[Percentage 2]]% of the 2010 1H Bonus Opportunity from the Bonus Participation Table below.

If both 1H and Full Year Performance Relative to Target for all Targets is [[Percentage 2]]% or greater, the product of A (x) B (x) C (x) T, as each is defined above with the exception of “C” which in such case “C” is the 2010 Total Bonus Opportunity in the Bonus Participation Table below.

If any one of the targets is not equal to or greater than [[Percentage 2]]%, then all targets are individually capped at [[Percentage 2]]%.

Any bonus earned for 1H performance will be accrued and paid with any earned Full Year bonus. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the 2010 Bonuses will be payable in one lump sum (subject to applicable withholding taxes and other deductions) within 30 days after all the Company’s consolidated financial results covering the annual period are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
