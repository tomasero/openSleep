\centered **FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT**

This FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) dated 30 [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Effective Date”) is among [[Organization 1 Name]], a Nevada Corp (“Borrower”) and [[Organization 2 Name]], a Bank incorporated in accordance with the laws of Australia (“Administrative Agent”) and Lenders party to the Credit Agreement (defined below). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meaning given to them in the Credit Agreement (defined below).

\centered **Background**

^Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders have previously entered into a Senior First Lien Secured Credit Agreement dated 29 [[Date 2: Date]] (as amended, restated, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) for the purpose of making available to Borrower a senior, secured term loan on a non-revolving basis;

^Borrower did not repay all Obligations on the Maturity Date (“Payment Default”). On the Effective Date Borrower has not repaid any or all of the Obligations and such amounts remain unpaid. On 30 [[Date 3: Date]], 28 [[Date 4: Date]] and 9 [[Date 5: Date]], Borrower requested that Administrative Agent and Lenders forbearand the Administrative Agent and Lenders did forbearfrom the exercise of any remedies with respect to the Payment Default. On the Effective Date, Borrower acknowledges that all previous forbearances with respect to the Payment Default have expired and are no longer in effect. Borrower has nevertheless again requested that Administrative Agent and Lenders forbear from the exercise of any remedies with respect to the Payment Default so that Borrower can consummate the transaction contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 30 [[Date 1]] between Borrower, as seller, and [[Organization 3 Name]], as buyer (the “PSA”).

^Administrative Agent and Lenders have agreed to forbear from the taking of any action with respect to the Payment Default subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the time specified herein and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

\centered **Agreements**

Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender (defined below) agree as follows:

“Forbearance Period” means the period beginning on the date that the conditions set out in Section 4 of this Agreement have been satisfied and ending on the earlier of (A) the occurrence of a Termination Event (defined below) or (B) 5:00 p.m. Houston time on 15 [[Date 6: Date]].

“Insolvency Proceeding” means any voluntary or involuntary proceeding in respect of bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up, receivership, dissolution or assignment for the benefit of creditors, in each of the foregoing events whether under the bankruptcy code or any similar federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or similar law.

“Termination Event” means (A) any additional Event of Default occurs under the Credit Agreement; (B) Lenders determine that any of the representations and warranties of Borrower under this Agreement or the Mutual Release were untrue when made; (C) Lenders determine that Borrower has failed to comply with any of the covenants under this Agreement; (D) the occurrence of any Adverse Action; (E) Borrower takes or directs, solicits, encourages or permits any other Person to take any action in contravention or frustration of this Agreement; (F) either Borrower or Alamo notifies the other that it has terminated (or intends to terminate) the PSA prior to the closing of the transaction contemplated therein; or (G) Lenders request (provided that Lenders cannot make such request prior to 24 [[Date 7: Date]]) and Borrower fails to provide, within three business days following Lenders’ request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lenders that the transaction contemplated by the PSA is likely to close on or before 15 [[Date 6]] and otherwise on the terms set forth in the PSA.

^^Other Defined Terms. Other capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement.

^**Payment Default**. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:

^^Borrower did not pay all outstanding monetary Obligations on the Maturity Date and accordingly Borrower agrees that such failure to pay is an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.1(a) of the Credit Agreement. 

^^Administrative Agent and the Lenders have previously delivered to Borrowerand Borrower has previously receiveda default notice with respect to the Payment Default, and any applicable cure period has expired.
