\centered **CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT** 

THIS AGREEMENT, is entered into as of [[Date 1: Date]], by and between [[Company]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (the “Company”), and [[Executive]] (“Executive”). 

\centered **RECITALS** 

The Executive Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a “Change of Control” (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes that it is important to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive that would result from the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive to continue to devote Executive’s full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefit arrangements upon the termination of Executive’s employment following a Change of Control. In order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has authorized the Company to enter into this Agreement with Executive.

^^Payments.

^^Severance Not Exclusive. The severance payments and benefits provided in this Article 2 shall be in addition to any other compensation or remuneration to which the Executive is, or shall become, entitled to receive from the Company.

^^Release. The Company’s obligation to make any payment to Executive as described in this Article 2 is contingent upon Executive’s execution of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that, in the opinion of the Company’s counsel, is effective to release the Company from all claims relating to Executive’s employment or the termination thereof, and the Company will have no obligation to make any payment unless and until such a release has become effective. 

\centered **LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF BENEFITS** 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the payments and benefits pursuant to Article 2 hereof, either alone or together with other payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to receive from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would constitute a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, the payments and benefits pursuant to Article 2 hereof shall be reduced, in the manner determined by independent tax counsel selected as provided below, by the amount, if any, which is the minimum necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits under Article 2 being non-deductible to the Company or such subsidiary pursuant to Section 280G of the Code and subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. The determination of whether any reduction in the payments and benefits is to be made pursuant to Article 3 shall be based upon the written advice of independent tax counsel selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive. The fees and expenses of the tax counsel shall be paid by the Company. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause such counsel to prepare the foregoing opinion as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within thirty (30) days after the date of the Qualifying Termination. The Company and the Executive agree to be bound by the determination of such tax counsel and to make appropriate payments to each other to give effect to the intent and purpose of this Article 3. 

\centered **TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT** 

This term of Agreement shall commence on the date of this Agreement and shall terminate on the earlier of (1) the date on Executive ceases to be a full time employee of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or (2) the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the earlier of such dates being the “Expiration Date”), except that if a Change of Control occurs prior to the Expiration Date, then the term of this Agreement shall continue until the later of (x) the end of the Termination Period, or (y) if a Qualifying Termination occurs during the Termination Period, the end of the Severance Period. Executive shall not be entitled to receive severance payments or benefits pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Change of Control that occurs after the Expiration Date. 

\centered **BENEFICIARIES** 

If the Executive shall die after the occurrence of a Qualifying Termination, but prior to the payment of all of the monthly severance payments required by Article 2 hereof, then all remaining severance payments shall be paid to the beneficiary designated in writing by the Executive at the same time, and in the same amount, as would have been payable to the Executive. The designation of a beneficiary for purposes of this Article 5 shall be revocable during the lifetime of the Executive. If the Executive does not designate a beneficiary under this Agreement, the beneficiary shall be deemed to be the same person that the Executive designated with respect to the Executive’s group life insurance program maintained by the Company. 

\centered **COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE OR SOLICIT CLIENTS** 

^^Non-Compete. During Executive’s employment with the Company and throughout the Severance Period (the “Restricted Period”), Executive shall not directly or indirectly (without the prior written consent of the Company) associate (including as a director, officer, employee, partner, consultant, agent or advisor) with a Competitive Enterprise in the Restricted Territory and in connection with Executive’s association engage, or directly or indirectly manage or supervise personnel engaged, in any activity: 

^^that is substantially related to any activity that Executive was engaged in with the Company during the 12 months prior to the date of termination of Executive’s employment,

^^Validity. The terms and provisions of this Article 6 are intended to be separate and divisible provisions and if, for any reason, any one or more of them is held to be invalid or unenforceable, neither the validity nor the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall thereby be affected. The parties hereto acknowledge that the potential restrictions on Executive’s future employment imposed by this Article 6 are reasonable in both duration and geographic scope and in all other respects. If for any reason any court of competent jurisdiction shall find any provisions of this Article 6 unreasonable in duration or geographic scope or otherwise, Executive and the Company agree that the restrictions and prohibitions contained herein shall be effective to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law in such jurisdiction. 

^^Consideration. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement would not have been entered into and the benefits described herein would not have been promised in the absence of Executive’s promises under this Article 6. 

^^Cease Payments. In the event that Executive breaches Section 6.1 or 6.2, the Company’s obligation to make or provide payments or benefits under Article 2 shall cease, to the extent not already paid or provided.

^^The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
