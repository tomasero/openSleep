Terms that have their initial letters capitalized, but that are not otherwise defined in this Agreement, shall have the meanings given to them in the Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement. This Option shall not be treated as an incentive stock option within the meaning of section 422(b) of the Code.

This Agreement sets forth the terms of the agreement between you and the Company with respect to the Option. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to be bound by all of the terms hereof.

^**Purchase Price**. The purchase price of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of this Option shall be $_____per share, which has been determined to be not less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at the date of grant of this Option, which is ____________ (the “***Date of Grant***”).

^^**Exercise Procedures**. Subject to the relevant provisions and limitations contained herein and in the Plan, you may exercise the Option to purchase all or a portion of the shares that vest and become exercisable on the Vesting Date at any time prior to the termination of the Option pursuant to this Agreement. In no event shall you be entitled to exercise the Option for any shares that are not vested. Exercise of the Option shall be made by delivery to the Company by you (or another person entitled to exercise the Option as provided hereunder) of (i) an executed “Notice of Stock Option Exercise,” ; and (ii) payment of the aggregate purchase price for shares purchased pursuant to the exercise. If you are on leave of absence for any reason, the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine that you will be considered still in the employ of or providing services for the Company, provided that rights to the Option may, in the discretion of the Company, be limited to the extent to which those rights were earned or vested when the leave of absence began.

^^**Payment of Purchase Price**. The purchase price of shares as to which this Option is exercised shall be paid in full at the time of exercise, at your election, with the approval of the Company, (i) in cash (including check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company), (ii) by delivering or constructively tendering to the Company shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the purchase price (provided such shares used for this purpose must have been held by you for such minimum period of time as may be established from time to time by the Committee), (iii) if the Stock is readily tradable on a national securities market, through a “cashless exercise” in accordance with a Company-established policy or program for the same, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing. No fraction of a share of Stock shall be issued by the Company upon exercise of an Option or accepted by the Company in payment of the exercise price thereof; rather, you shall provide a cash payment for such amount as is necessary to effect the issuance and acceptance of only whole shares of Stock. Unless and until a certificate or certificates representing such shares shall have been issued by the Company to you, you (or the person permitted to exercise this Option in the event of your death) shall not be or have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to shares acquirable upon an exercise of this Option.

^^^If your employment relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated voluntarily by you prior to the Vesting Date and such termination is not a Termination for Good Reason (as such term is defined in the Severance Agreement between you and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries), then this Option shall terminate as of the date of such termination and shall never become exercisable.

^^^If your employment relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated voluntarily by you on or after the Vesting Date and such termination is not a Termination for Good Reason, then this Option, to the extent then vested and exercisable, may be exercised by you at any time during the period ending on the earlier to occur of (A) thirty (30) days following such termination, or (B) the Expiration Date.

^^**Other Termination Events**.  
^^^If your employment relationship with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries by which you are employed is terminated prior to the Vesting Date as a result of any of the following events:

^**Transferability**. This Option, and any rights or interests therein, will be transferable by you only to the extent permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 10 of the Plan or approved by the Committee.

^**Furnish Information**. You agree to furnish to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirements imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation.

^**Remedies**. The parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from each other reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement whether by an action to enforce specific performance or for damages for its breach or otherwise. If, due to Section 4 of the Plan, the Company fails or is unable to permit you to exercise all or any part of this Option following your delivery of written notice of exercise to the Company and tender of performance in accordance with this Agreement (which failure shall not be deemed a permitted delay pursua nt to Section 24 of this Agreement), as your sole and exclusive remedy for such failure, in addition to the rights provided under the first sentence of this Section 8, you may require the Company to pay to you an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Company failed to permit you to exercise your Option, times (ii) the difference of (A) the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of your exercise minus (B) the purchase price set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan). The Company shall make such payment to you with in ten (10) following receipt of your written demand therefor, subject to compliance with any tax withholding obligations that the Company in its discretion deems to be necessary with respect to such payment. Upon such payment to you, that portion of the Option as to which you tendered a notice of exercise but for which exercise was not permitted shall terminate and cease to be exercisable.

^**Information Confidential**. As partial consideration for the granting of the Option hereunder, you hereby agree with the Company that you will keep confidential all information and knowledge, except that which has been disclosed in any public filings required by law, that you have relating to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that such information may be disclosed as required by law and may be given in confidence to your spouse, tax and financial advisors, or to a financial institution to the extent that such information is necessary to secure a loan. In the event any breach of thi s promise comes to the attention of the Company, it shall take into consideration that breach in determining whether to recommend the grant of any future similar award to you, as a factor militating against the advisability of granting any such future award to you.

^**Payment of Taxes**.  
^^**Withholding Requirement**. The Committee may, in its discretion, require you to pay to the Company at the time of exercise of an Option or thereafter, the amount that the Committee deems necessary to satisfy the Company’s current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes that you incur by exercising the Option. In connection with such an event requiring tax withholding, you may (i) direct the Company, in the Company’s discretion, to withhold from the shares of Stock to be issued upon exercise the number of shares necessary to satisfy the Company’s obligation to withhold taxes, that determination to be based on the shares’ Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise; (ii) deliver to the Company, in the Company’s discretion, sufficient shares of Stock (based upon the Fair Market Value as of the date of such delivery) to satisfy the Company’s tax withholding obligation; or (iii) deliver sufficient cash to the Company to satisfy its tax withholding obligations. If you elect to use a Stock withholding feature, you must make the election at the time and in the manner that the Committee prescribes. The Committee may, at its sole option, deny your request to satisfy withholding obligations through shares of Stock instead of cash.

^^**Deficiency**. If you fail to pay the required amount to the Company and fail to make a Stock withholding election pursuant to **Section 10(a)(i)** or **10(a)(ii)** above, the Company is authorized to withhold from any cash remuneration (or, Stock remuneration, including withholding any shares of Stock distributable to you upon exercise of this Option) then or thereafter payable to you any tax required to be withheld by reason of the exercise of this Option or the disposition of shares of Stock acq uired by exercise of this Option. If the Committee subsequently determines that the aggregate Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or delivered as payment of any tax withholding obligation is insufficient to discharge that tax withholding obligation, you shall pay to the Company, immediately upon the Committee’s request, the amount of the deficiency in the form of payment requested by the Committee.

^**Right of the Company and Subsidiaries to Terminate Employment**. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or interfere in any way with the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to terminate your employment at any time.

Records of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding your period of employment, termination of employment and the reason therefor, leaves of absence, re-employment, and other matters shall be conclusive for all purposes hereunder, unless determined by the Company to be incorrect.

^**Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.

The Company may delay the exercise of the Option if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state, or foreign securities laws or other laws or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. Until the shares of Stock acquirable upon the exercise of the Option have been registered for issuance under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “***Securities Act***”), the Company will not issue such shares unless you provide the Company with a written opinion of legal counsel, who shall be satisfactory to the Company, addressed to the Company and satisfactory in form and substance to the Company’s counsel, to the effect that the proposed issuance of such shares to you may be made without registration under the Securities Act. YOU ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. Except as expressly provided in Section 8 of this Agreement, the inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained.

^^Notwithstanding **Section 4(c)** or (d), if the exercise of the Option within the applicable time period set forth in **Section 4(c)** or (d) is prevented by the provisions of **Section 24(a)** above, the Option will remain exercisable until 30 days after the date you are notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Expiration Date. The Company makes no re presentation as to the tax consequences of any such delayed exercise. You should consult with your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of any such delayed exercise.

^**Extension in Connection with Section 16**. Notwithstanding **Section 4(c)** or (d), if a sale within the applicable time periods set forth in **Section 4(c)** or (d) of shares acquired upon exercise of the Option would subject you to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Option will remain exercisable until the earliest to occur of (a) the 10th day following the date on which a sale of such shares by you would no longer be subject to such suit, (b) the 190th day after your termination of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (c) the Expiration 

Date. The Company makes no representation as to the tax consequences of any such delayed exercise. You should consult with your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of any such delayed exercise.
