Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.4(a), the failure of the Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless the resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. 

^^**Limitations****.** The following provisions of this Section 9.4 shall limit the indemnification obligations hereunder: 

^^Limitation as to Time. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Indemnified Costs pursuant to this Article IX unless a written claim for indemnification in accordance with Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 is given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto on or before 5:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the second anniversary of the Closing Date.

^^**Severability****.** If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

^^**Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial****.** This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

^^**Arbitration Provision**.** Any and all Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved through the use of binding arbitration using three arbitrators, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any inconsistency between this Section 10.5 and the Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Section 10.5 will control the rights and obligations of the Parties. Arbitration must be initiated within the time limits set forth in this Agreement, or if no such limits apply, then within a reasonable time or the time period allowed by the applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration may be initiated by a Party (“***Claimant***”) serving written notice on the other Party (“*Respondent***”) that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant’s notice initiating binding arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. The Respondent shall respond to Claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of Claimant’s notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If the Respondent fails for any reason to name an arbitrator within the thirty (30)-day period, Claimant shall petition the American Arbitration Association for appointment of an arbitrator for Respondent’s account. The two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. The Claimant will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by it, and the Respondent will pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it. The costs of petitioning for the appointment of an arbitrator, if any, shall be paid by Respondent. The Claimant and Respondent will each pay one-half (/) of the compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator. All arbitrators must (i) be neutral parties who have never been officers, directors or employees of any Seller, Buyer or any of their Affiliates and (ii) have not less than seven (7) years experience in the petroleum transportation industry. The hearing will be conducted in Dallas, Texas and commence within thirty (30) days after the selection of the third arbitrator. Sellers, Buyers and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently and in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties hereto. The arbitrators shall have no right to grant or award indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind. The Arbitrable Disputes may be arbitrated in a common proceeding along 

^^^^^ 
with disputes under other agreements between Sellers, Buyers or their Affiliates to the extent that the issues raised in such disputes are related. Without the written consent of the Parties, no unrelated disputes or third party disputes may be joined to an arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. 

^^**Parties in Interest****.** This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

^^**Assignment of Agreement****.** At any time, the Parties may make a collateral assignment of their rights under this Agreement to any of their bona fide lenders or debt holders, or a trustee or a representative for any of them, and the non-assigning Parties shall execute an acknowledgment of such collateral assignment in such form as may from time to time be reasonably requested; *provided*, *however*, that unless written notice is given to the non-assigning Party that any such collateral assignment has been foreclosed upon, such non-assigning Party shall be entitled to deal exclusively with either or both of the Buyers or either or both of the Sellers, as the case may be, as to any matters arising under this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement (other than for delivery of notices required by any such collateral assignment). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.7, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto. 

^^**Counterparts****.** This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

^^**Director and Officer Liability****.** The directors, managers, officers, partners and stockholders of the Buyer, the Seller and their respective affiliates shall not have any personal liability or obligation arising under this Agreement (including any claims that another party may assert) other than as an assignee of this Agreement or pursuant to a written guarantee. 

^^**Integration****.** This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement supersede any previous understandings or agreements among the Parties, whether oral or written, with respect to their subject matter. This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement contain the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. No understanding, representation, promise or agreement, whether oral or written, is intended to be or shall be included in or form part of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement unless it is contained in a written amendment hereto or thereto and executed by the Parties hereto or thereto after the date of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Omnibus Agreement.

^^**Guaranty Absolute****.** Holly hereby guarantees that the Payment Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The obligations of Holly under this Agreement constitute a present and continuing guaranty of payment, and not of collection or collectability. The liability of Holly under this Agreement shall be absolute, unconditional, present, continuing and irrevocable irrespective of: 

^^any assignment or other transfer of the Agreement or any of the rights thereunder of any Buyer; 

^^any amendment, waiver, renewal, extension or release of or any consent to or departure from or other action or inaction related to the Agreement; 

^^any acceptance by any Buyer of partial payment or performance from the Indemnifying Party; 

^^any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to the Indemnifying Party, or any action taken with respect to the Agreements by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding; 

^^^^^ 
^^any absence of any notice to, or knowledge of, Holly, of the existence or occurrence of any of the matters or events set forth in the foregoing subsections (a) through (d); or 

^^any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a guarantor. 

The obligations of Holly hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Payment Obligations or otherwise. 

^^**Waiver****.** Holly hereby waives promptness, diligence, all setoffs, presentments, protests and notice of acceptance and any other notice relating to any of the Payment Obligations and any requirement for any Buyer to protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Indemnifying Party, any other entity or any collateral. 

^^**Subrogation Waiver****.** Holly agrees that it shall not have any rights (direct or indirect) of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnification or other rights of payment or recovery from the Indemnifying Party for any payments made by Holly under this Article XI until all Payment Obligations have been indefeasibly paid, and Holly hereby irrevocably waives and releases, absolutely and unconditionally, any such rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and other rights of payment or recovery it may now have or hereafter acquire against the Indemnifying Party until all Payment Obligations have been indefeasibly paid. 

^^**Reinstatement****.** The obligations of Holly under this Article XI shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Payment Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned to the Indemnifying Party or any other entity, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment, composition, liquidation or reorganization of the Indemnifying Party or such other entity, or for any other reason, all as though such payment had not been made. 

^^**Continuing Guaranty****.** This Article XI is a continuing guaranty and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the first to occur of the indefeasible payment in full of all of the Payment Obligations, (ii) be binding upon Holly, its successors and assigns and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Buyer and its successors, transferees and assigns. 

^^**No Duty to Pursue Others****.** It shall not be necessary for any Buyer (and Holly hereby waives any rights which Holly may have to require Buyer), in order to enforce such payment by Holly, first to (i) institute suit or exhaust its remedies against the Indemnifying Party or others liable on the Payment Obligations or any other person, (ii) enforce such Buyer’s rights against any other guarantors of the Payment Obligations, (iii) join the Indemnifying Party or any others liable on the Payment Obligations in any action seeking to enforce this Article XI, (iv) exhaust any remedies available to such Buyer against any security which shall ever have
