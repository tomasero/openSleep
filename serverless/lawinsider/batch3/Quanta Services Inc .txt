§ The Potential Incentive Earned (“PIE”) (expressed in dollars) is defined as the result of multiplying the “Incentive as a percentage of Target Incentive” (calculated from the above table) by the participant’s Target incentive (expressed in dollars). 

**OPERATING INCOME COMPONENT:** 

§ Eighty-Five percent of a participant’s PIE will be based on the above operating income calculation, subject to the limitations outlined below, for said participant’s operating unit. 

**STRATEGIC GOALS DISCRETIONARY COMPONENT:** 

§ As long as the “Percentage of Operating Income Goal Obtained (calculated from the above table) exceeds [[Percentage 11]]%, the remaining fifteen percent of the PIE will be a discretionary award for each participant based on obtaining pre-established operating unit objectives for the year in support of their respective operating unit’s strategic business plan. 

§ If the “Percentage of Operating Income Goal Obtained (calculated from the above table) is less than or equal to [[Percentage 11]]%, then [[Percentage 14: Number]]% of the Target Incentive will be a discretionary award for each participant based on obtaining pre-established operating unit objectives for the year in support of their respective operating unit’s strategic business plan. 

§ Such goals will be as specific and measurable as possible and documented in writing. 

Limitations    § The annual incentive calculation is subject to the following limitations; sequenced as follows:  Step 1:  Is target bonus pool > [[Percentage 15: Number]]% of the operating income before goodwill and after insurance true-up (before consideration of intercompany interest income or expense, interest expense, and gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment)?

If Yes, Go to Step 2.  If No, use the Incentive Determination chart above. Any bonus earned (for the aggregate pool) is limited to [[Percentage 15]]% of operating income (as defined). Further, any individual bonuses are capped at [[Percentage 13]]% of the individual target bonus.  Step 2:  Has the Operating Income Goal been met or exceeded? If Yes, go to b., If No, go to a. 

^^Use the Incentive Determination chart above with the following limitations: Bonuses earned under this section ( for the pool) are limited to [[Percentage 15]]% of actual operating income (as defined). 

^^Use the Incentive Determination chart above with the following limitations:  Up to [[Percentage 15]]% of the operating income goal (as defined) can be earned by the pool participants. For every dollar of operating income (as defined) in excess of the operating income goal, $.25 will be contributed to the bonus pool. Add this amount to the results of the Incentive Determination chart. The total contribution under this paragraph b. is limited to [[Percentage 11]]% of the target bonus for each of the pool participants. 

Incentive Payout    § Any calculated incentive will be subject to (i) assessment of overall company performance to ensure that payout of calculated incentives will not jeopardize the financial stability of the company and (ii) approval by the Compensation Committee. 

§ A participant must be employed by the company on the date the bonus is paid. Any participant not employed by the company on the payment date forfeits any and all rights to such bonus.

Target Incentive    Each participant will be assigned a target supplemental incentive expressed as a dollar value annually. 

Performance Measures and Incentive Determination    **Performance Award:** 

§ Fifty percent of a participant’s supplemental incentive value will be based on Modified Return on Asset (MROA) performance versus target. 

§ MROA will be calculated by dividing net operating income by total assets. Operating Income is defined as operating income before goodwill, after insurance true-up (before consideration of intercompany interest income or expense, interest expense, and gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment).. Total assets will be based on the quarterly average for the fiscal year excluding inter-company accounts and cash on hand.

**Percentage of Target /**    **Incentive as a % of**
**Objective Obtained**    **Target Incentive**
Less than [[Percentage 1]]%    [[Percentage 2]]%

When performance falls between the designated points in the table, the incentive will be determined by interpolation. 

**Discretionary Award** 

The remaining fifty percent of the supplemental incentive will, in lieu of a discretionary component, be based on the following safety measurement: 

§ Total Incident Injury Rate: 

Ø Each Operating Unit has a “Total Incident Injury Rate” (“TIIR”) calculated for the prior year. Subject to each participant’s ethical behavior and compliance with the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, the discretionary award will be based on improvements in TIIR performance. The baseline for measuring current year performance is the respective actual TIIR for the prior year expressed as a percentage of hours worked. The following Bonus Eligibility Scale will be used to measure the amount of bonus earned as a result of improvement in the TIIR rate from the prior year to the current year:  

If TIIR rate is    Bonus earned
Reduced by:    will be:
Less than [[Percentage 16: Number]]%    [[Percentage 2]]%

[[Percentage 14]]%    [[Percentage 1]]%
[[Percentage 18: Number]]%    [[Percentage 11]]%
Greater than [[Percentage 19: Number]]%    [[Percentage 20: Number]]%

\centered 

Ø When performance falls between the designated points in the table, the incentive will be determined by interpolation. 

Ø Regardless of the percentage decrease, if an operating unit has a TIIR below the respective target identified below at the end of the current year, then [[Percentage 11]]% of the target bonus is earned: 

§ Electric Power Operating Unit - 2.50 

§ Nat Gas & Pipeline Operating Unit  1.75 

§ Telecom Operating Unit  1.75  

^^^^^ 
\centered 

Ø Regardless of the percentage decrease, if an operating unit has a TIIR above 4.5; it is ineligible for this incentive component. 

Limitations    § Any calculated incentive will be subject to (i) assessment of overall company performance to ensure that payout of calculated incentives will not jeopardize the financial stability of the company and (ii) approval by the Compensation Committee. 

§ In any year, stock awarded under this and all other plans shall not exceed [[Percentage 21: Number]]% of the outstanding stock. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors will review this limitation annually. 

§ A participant must be employed by the company on the date the bonus is paid. Any participant not employed by the company on the payment date forfeits any and all rights to such bonus. It is the company’s intention to pay bonuses earned under the plan in March following the end of the calculation period. 

§ A new participant added to this Plan during the Plan year will be pro-rated from their date of hire. In any event, a new participant must be employed by [[Date 1]] to be eligible for incentives in the current plan year. 

Incentive Payout    § Stock Eligible participants, at the election of the CEO with approval by the Compensation Committee, may receive any incentive earned under the Supplemental plan in cash, restricted stock or a combination thereof. Subject to the above limitations, the portion of the incentive awarded in restricted stock will be multiplied by 1.10 and then that amount will be divided by the current stock price to determine the number of shares. Any shares awarded will vest ratably over a three-year period following the date of grant. A participant receiving restricted stock must be employed by the company at each vesting date. If a participant leaves the employment of the company, all unvested restricted stock awards are forfeited.
