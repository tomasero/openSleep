**RECITALS** 

^The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of providing incentives to attract, retain and motivate eligible Employees, Directors and Consultants who provide services to the Corporation (or any Related Entity). 

^Participant is to render valuable services to the Corporation (or a Related Entity), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Corporation’s issuance of shares of Common Stock to Participant thereunder. 

^All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix A. 

**NOW, THEREFORE,** the Corporation hereby awards Restricted Stock Units to Participant upon the following terms and conditions: 

^**Grant of Restricted Stock Units**. The Corporation hereby awards to Participant, as of the Award Date, Restricted Stock Units under the Plan. Each Restricted Stock Unit that vests hereunder will entitle Participant to receive one share of Common Stock on the specified issuance date for that unit. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the awarded Restricted Stock Units, the applicable vesting schedule for those shares, the dates on which those vested shares shall become issuable to Participant and the remaining terms and conditions governing the award (the “***Award***”) shall be as set forth in this Agreement. 

\centered **AWARD SUMMARY** 

Participant:   __________________________________

Award Date:   , 200

Number of Shares Subject to Award:   shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”)

Vesting Schedule:   The Shares shall vest in a series of () successive equal annual installments upon the Participant’s completion of each successive year of Continuous Service over the ()-year period measured from the Award Date (the “***Normal Vesting Schedule***”). However, one or more Shares may be subject to accelerated vesting in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.

Issuance Schedule   The Shares in which Participant vests in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule shall become issuable immediately on the applicable annual vesting date, subject to the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. In no event will the Shares in which the Participant so vests be issued later than the ***later*** of (i) the close of the calendar year in which the Shares vest pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following such vesting date. The procedures pursuant to which the applicable Withholding Taxes are to be collected are set forth in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement.

^**Limited Transferability**. Prior to actual receipt of the Shares which vest hereunder, Participant may not transfer any interest in the Award or the underlying Shares or pledge or otherwise hedge the sale of those Shares, including (without limitation) any short sale or any acquisition or disposition of any put or call option or other instrument tied to the value of the underlying shares of Common Stock. However, any Shares which vest hereunder but which otherwise remain unissued at the time of Participant’s death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of Participant’s will or the laws of inheritance or to Participant’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this Award. Participant may also direct the Corporation to re-issue the stock certificates for any Shares which in fact vest and become issuable under the Award during his or her lifetime to one or more designated members of Participant’s Immediate Family or a trust established for Participant and/or the members of his or her Immediate Family. Participant may make such a beneficiary designation at any time by completing the Corporation’s Universal Beneficiary Designation form and filing the completed form with the Corporation’s Human Resources Department. 

^**Cessation of Service**. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5 below, should Participant cease Continuous Service for any reason prior to vesting in one or more Shares pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule, then the Award will be immediately cancelled with respect to those unvested Shares, and the number of Restricted Stock Units will be reduced accordingly. Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled units. 

^**Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents** 

^^The holder of this Award shall not have any stockholder rights, including voting, dividend or liquidation rights, with respect to the Shares subject to the Award until Participant becomes the record holder of those Shares upon their actual issuance following the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any dividend or other distribution, whether regular or extraordinary and whether payable in cash, securities (other than Common Stock) or other property, be declared and paid on the outstanding Common Stock while one or more Shares remain subject to this Award (i.e., those Shares are not otherwise issued and outstanding for purposes of entitlement to the dividend or distribution), then a special book account shall be established for Participant and credited with a phantom dividend equivalent to the actual dividend or distribution which would have been paid on the Shares at the time subject to this Award had they been issued and outstanding and entitled to that dividend or distribution. As the Shares subsequently vest hereunder, the phantom dividend equivalents so credited to those Shares in the book account shall vest and shall be distributed to Participant (in the same form the actual dividend or distribution was paid to the holders of the Common Stock entitled to that dividend or distribution or in such other form as the Administrator deems appropriate under the circumstances) concurrently with the issuance of the vested Shares to which those phantom dividend equivalents relate. However, each such distribution shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of the Withholding Taxes applicable to that distribution. 

^^Should Participant cease Continuous Service without vesting in one or more of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Award (including any shares which do not otherwise vest at that time after taking into account any applicable vesting acceleration provisions set forth in Paragraph 5 of this Agreement), then the phantom dividend equivalents credited to those unvested shares shall be cancelled, and Participant shall thereupon cease to have any further right or entitlement to those cancelled amounts. 

^**Change of Control**. 

^^Any Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award at the time of a Change in Control may be (i) assumed or otherwise continued in full force and effect by the surviving corporation, (ii) replaced with an economically-equivalent substitute award or (iii) replaced with a cash retention program of the successor corporation that is in a dollar amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying those Restricted Stock Units (as measured immediately prior to the Change in Control) and provides for the subsequent vesting and payout of that dollar amount in accordance with the same vesting and issuance provisions that would otherwise be in effect for those Shares in the absence of the Change in Control. In the event of such assumption or continuation of the Award or such replacement of the Award with an economically-equivalent award or cash retention program, no accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall occur at the time of the Change in Control. 

^^In the event the Award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect, the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award shall be adjusted immediately after the consummation of the Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which the Shares underlying those units immediately prior to the Change in Control would have been converted in consummation of that Change in Control had those Shares actually been issued and outstanding at that time. To the extent the actual holders of the outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation (or parent entity) may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award at that time and with the approval of the Administrator, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control transaction, provided the substituted common stock is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities exchange or market. 

^^Any Restricted Stock Units which are to be assumed or otherwise continued in effect in connection with the Change in Control or are to be replaced with an economically equivalent award or cash retention program in accordance with Paragraph 5(a) shall be subject to accelerated vesting in accordance with the following provision: 

      If the Participant’s Employee status is unilaterally terminated as a result of an involuntary termination (other than for death or Permanent Disability) without Cause, or if the Participant resigns from such Employee status due to a Constructive Termination, at any time during the period beginning with the execution date of the definitive agreement for that Change in Control transaction and ending with the earlier of (i) the termination of that definitive agreement without the consummation of such Change in Control or (ii) the expiration of the Applicable Acceleration Period following the consummation of such Change in Control, then the Participant shall immediately vest in all the unvested Shares at the time subject to this Award. The Shares that vest pursuant to this Paragraph 5(c) shall be issued on the date of the Participant’s Separation from Service in connection with such termination of Employee status or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than the ***later*** of (i) the close of the calendar year in which the such Separation from Service occurs or (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date of such Separation from Service. The applicable Withholding Taxes with respect to such issuance shall be collected in accordance with Paragraph 7 of this Agreement.

^^If the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award at the time of the Change in Control are not assumed or otherwise continued in effect in connection with the Change in Control or are not replaced with an economically equivalent award or cash incentive program in accordance with Paragraph 5(a), then those units will vest immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control. The Shares subject to those vested units shall be converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Common Stock payable to the other stockholders of the Corporation in consummation of that Change in Control, and such consideration per Share shall be distributed to Participant upon the tenth (10th) business day following the ***earliest*** to occur of (i) the date the Share would have otherwise vested and been issued pursuant to the Vesting and Issuance Schedules set forth in Paragraph 1 in the absence of such Change in Control, (ii) the date of Participant’s Separation from Service or (iii) the first date following a Qualifying Change in Control on which the distribution can be made without contravention of any applicable provisions of Code Section 409A. Such distribution shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes pursuant to the provisions of Section 7. 

^^This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

^**Adjustment in Shares**. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction, extraordinary dividend or distribution or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration, or should the value of outstanding shares of Common Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, or should there occur any merger, consolidation or other reorganization, then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Administrator to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award. The Administrator shall make the adjustments in such manner as the Administrator deems appropriate in order to reflect such change and shall take into account any amounts to be credited to Participant’s book account under Paragraph 4(b) in connection with the transaction. The adjustments made by the Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. In the event of a Change in Control, the provisions of Paragraph 5 shall be controlling. 

^**Issuance of Shares of Common Stock**. 

^^On each date on which one or more Shares are to be issued in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of the Participant a certificate (which may be in electronic form) for those Shares and shall concurrently distribute to the Participant any phantom dividend equivalents with respect to those Shares, subject in each instance to the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. 

^^The Corporation shall collect the Withholding Taxes with respect to the distributed phantom dividend equivalents by withholding a portion of that distribution equal to the amount of the applicable Withholding Taxes, with the cash portion of the distribution to be the first portion so withheld. 

^^Unless Participant (i) otherwise makes satisfactory arrangements with the Corporation’s Human Resources Department, not later than forty-five (45) days prior to the applicable date on which one or more shares of Common Stock vest and become issuable hereunder, to pay the applicable Withholding Taxes through the delivery of a check payable to the Corporation in the amount of such Withholding Taxes and (ii) in fact delivers such check to the Corporation not later than that vesting date, the Corporation shall collect the applicable Withholding Taxes through the following automatic share withholding method: 

      On the actual issuance date, the Corporation shall withhold, from the vested shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to Participant at that time, a portion of those shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the issuance date) equal to the applicable Withholding Taxes; ***provided*, *however***, that the number of shares of Common Stock which the Corporation shall be required to so withhold shall not exceed in Fair Market Value the amount necessary to satisfy the Corporation’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income.

^^Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5 or Paragraph 7(a), the settlement of all Restricted Stock Units which vest under the Award shall be made solely in shares of Common Stock. In no event, however, shall any fractional shares be issued. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Common Stock to be issued at the time the Award vests shall, to the extent necessary, be rounded down to the next whole share in order to avoid the issuance of a fractional share. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 7, the employee portion of the federal, state and local employment taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation in connection with the vesting of the Shares or any other amounts hereunder (the “***Employment Taxes***”) shall in all events be collected from the Participant no later than the last business day of the calendar year in which the Shares or other amounts vest hereunder. Accordingly, to the extent the issuance date for one or more vested Shares or the distribution date for such other amounts is to occur in a year subsequent to the calendar year in which those Shares or other amounts vest hereunder, the Participant shall, on or before the last business day of the calendar year in which the Shares or other amounts vest, deliver to the Corporation a check payable to its order in the dollar amount equal to the Employment Taxes required to be withheld with respect to those Shares or other amounts. The provisions of this Paragraph 7(e) shall be applicable only to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable tax withholding requirements of Code Section 3121(v). 

^**Leaves of Absence**. For purposes of the applying the various vesting provisions of this Agreement, Participant shall be deemed to cease Continuous Service on the commencement date of any leave of absence and not to remain in Continuous Service during the period of that leave, except to the extent otherwise required by law or pursuant to the following policy: 

      Participant shall receive Continuous Service credit for such vesting purposes for (i) the first three months of an approved personal leave of absence and (ii) the first seven months of any bona fide leave of absence (other than an approved personal leave), but in no event beyond the expiration date of such leave of absence.

      In no event, however, shall Participant be deemed, for vesting purposes hereunder, to remain in Continuous Service beyond the ***earliest*** of (i) the expiration date of that leave of absence, unless Participant returns to active Continuous Service or Employee status on or before that date, (ii) the date Participant’s Continuous Service or Employee status actually terminates by reason of his or her voluntary or involuntary termination or by reason of his or her death or disability or (iii) the date the Participant is deemed to have a Separation from Service.

^**Compliance with Laws and Regulations**. The issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Award shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Participant with all Applicable Laws relating thereto. 

^**Deferred Issuance Date**. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent this Award may be deemed to create a deferred compensation arrangement under Code Section 409A, then the following limitation shall apply: 

      No Shares or other amounts which become issuable or distributable under this Agreement upon Participant’s Separation from Service shall actually be issued or distributed to Participant prior to the ***earlier*** of (i) the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of such Separation from Service or (ii) the date of Participant’s death, if Participant is deemed at the time of such Separation from Service to be a specified employee under Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations issued under Code Section 409A, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with consistent and uniform standards applied to all other Code Section 409A arrangements of the Corporation, and such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). The deferred Shares or other distributable amount shall be issued or distributed in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of Participant’s Separation from Service or, if earlier, the first day of the month immediately following the date the Corporation receives proof of Participant’s death.

      To the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether any provision of this Agreement would otherwise contravene one or more requirements or limitations of Code Section 409A, such provisions shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that does not result in a violation of the applicable requirements or limitations of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

^**Notices**. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Corporation under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Participant shall be in writing and addressed to Participant at the most current address then indicated for Participant on the Corporation’s employee records or shall be delivered electronically to Participant through the Corporation’s electronic mail system or through the on-line brokerage firm authorized by the Corporation to effect sale of the Common Stock issued hereunder. All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or delivery through the Corporation’s electronic mail system or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 

^**Successors and Assigns**.

^**Construction**. This Agreement and the Award evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall be controlling. All decisions of the Administrator with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in the Award. 

^**Governing Law**. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without resort to that State’s conflict-of-laws rules. 

^**Employment at Will**. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon Participant any right to remain in Continuous Service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation (or any Related Entity employing or retaining Participant) or of Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate Participant’s Continuous Service at any time for any reason, with or without Cause.
