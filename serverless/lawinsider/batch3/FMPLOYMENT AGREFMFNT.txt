It is agreed by all parties that any and all terms of this royalty agreement arc valid and shall remain in effect with the following exception.

^**Exception to Royalty Agreement** - The terms of the royalty agreement clearly detail the Employee's right to certain royalties as detailed in Attachment (A). In return for the entering into the terms of this employment agreement, the employee has agreed to forgo any royalties due and payable under the terms of Attachment (A) only up to and equal to the amount of each years salary as defined herein as to not unfairly burden the company.

^**Example** - This is to mean that providing any and all terms of compensation and other terms as detailed herein are paid in full and in a timely manner, in year one the Employee will forgo his royalties due on the first $250.000 only, in year two $[[USD Value 1: Number]] only and so on through year ten per details in section as detailed below, of any such royalty due under the terms of Attachment (A) after which any additional royalties due per Attachment (A) would be due and payable as per the terms of the Royalty Agreement.

The employee may choose at his sole discretion at anytime to temporarily delay or defer the acceptance of any portion of the above stated amounts due. Should this ever take place this action will in no way whatsoever weaken or lesson the validity of any and all of the terms of this agreement but rather shall serve only to place the company in arrears with the employee as to any amounts due and payable, which shall become due and payable in full within 72 hrs (seventy two hours) after the employee requests or demands such payment in writing of any portion of or the entire amount of any and all past due monies.

The stated salary may be increased from time to time in the sole discretion of [[inventions]] without amendment to this Agreement.

Employee may, in his sole discretion, waive application of this/these provisions. Execution of this Agreement by the Directors of the Company and the disinterested holders of a majority of issued and outstanding shares signifies their resolution that this anti-dilution provision is necessary as a condition to Employee's continued employment and in the best interests of the Company.

^**Title and Duties** - The Employee's title shall be President and Chief Executive Officer. His particular duties shall be delineated by the Board of Directors from time to time. As President, Employee's duties shall be those customarily discharged by a person holding such office in a business corporation and shall include, but not limited to, responsibility for the management of [[inventions]]'s business affairs.

^**Restrictive Covenant** - Providing that the company has remained current with respect to all terms of this agreement, during his employment with [[inventions]] and for a period of three (3) years immediately following termination of such employment, by termination of this Employment Agreement by [[inventions]] the Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, either as an individual on his own account or as a partner, joint venturer, employee, agent salesman, contractor, officer, director or stockholder or otherwise, enter into, engage in, or accept employment from any business in direct competition with the business (The Energy Drink Business) of [[inventions]], as such business now exists or as it may exist at the time of termination, anywhere in the United States ("the Restrictive Covenant"); this Restrictive Covenant specifically includes as prohibited businesses, but it is not limited to (i) furnishing services, (ii) developing product and processes, or techniques, and (iii) training individuals to engage in any business in direct competition with [[inventions]], or similar competing activities.

This Restrictive Covenant on the part of die Employee is given and made by the Employee to induce [[inventions]] to employ the Employee and to enter into this Employment Agreement with the Employee, and the Employee hereby acknowledges the sufficiency of the consideration for this Restrictive Covenant.

This Restrictive Covenant shall be construed as an agreement independent of any provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of the Employee against [[inventions]], whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by [[inventions]] of this Restrictive Covenant. [[inventions]] has fully performed all obligations entitling it to the Restrictive Covenant, and the Restrictive Covenant therefore is not executor or otherwise subject to rejection under the Bankruptcy Code.

The Restrictive Covenant is a reasonable and necessary restraint of trade and does not violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Colorado Antitrust Act, or the common law; it is supported by valid business interests, including the protection of [[inventions]] trade secrets and confidential business information, the protection of its relationships with customers and prospective customers, and extraordinary expenses incurred by [[inventions]] and its affiliates to recruit, train, and locate the Employee, and the one (1) year restriction is essential to the full protection of those valid business interests.

If any portion of this Restrictive Covenant is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy for any reason, the Restrictive Covenant shall be considered divisible as to line of business, time, and geographic area; if a court of competent jurisdiction should determine the specified lines of business, the specified period, or the specified geographic area to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy for any reason, a narrower line of business, a lesser period, or a smaller geographic area that is determined to be reasonable, non-arbitrary, and not against public policy for any reason, may be enforce by [[inventions]] against the Employee.

^**Restrictive Covenant-Remedies** - [[inventions]] and the Employee agree that, in the event of a breach by the Employee of the Restrictive Covenant set forth in paragraph 8, above, such a breach would injure [[inventions]] and would leave [[inventions]] with no adequate remedy at law, and [[inventions]] and the Employee further agree that, if legal proceedings should have to be brought by [[inventions]] against the Employee to enforce the Restrictive Covenant, [[inventions]] shall be entitled to all available civil remedies, including without limitation:

^^^Preliminary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the Employee from violating, directly or indirectly, cither as an individual on his own account or as a partner, joint venturer, employee, agent, salesman, contractor, officer, director, or stockholder or otherwise, the restrictions of paragraph 8, above;

^^^Reasonable attorney's fees in the trial and appellate courts and all arbitration proceedings; and

^^^Costs and Expenses of investigation, litigation, and arbitration, including expert witness fees, deposition costs (appearance fees and transcript charges), injunction bond premiums, travel and lodging expenses, arbitration fees and charges, and all other reasonable costs and expenses.

^^^Should [[inventions]] be unsuccessful in enforcing this Restrictive Covenant, for any reason as determined by the court, Employee shall be entitled to a full recovery of all reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Nothing in this Employment Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting [[inventions]] from pursuing any other legal or equitable remedies available to it for breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenant by the Employee arc not readily ascertainable as of the date of this Agreement.

If the Employee violates this Restrictive Covenant, either as an individual on his own account or as a partner, joint venturer, employee, agent, salesman, contractor, officer, director, or stockholder or otherwise, any and all sales of services by the Employee (or the partnership, joint venturer, corporation, or other entity with which he or she is associated) in competition with the services of [[inventions]] shall be conclusively presumed to have been made by [[inventions]], but for the violation of this Restrictive Covenant.

Should legal proceedings have to be brought by [[inventions]] against the Employee to enforce the Restrictive Covenant, the period of restriction shall be deemed to begin running on the date of entry of an order granting [[inventions]] preliminary injunctive relief and shall continue uninterrupted for the next succeeding one (1) year; the Employee acknowledges that such purposes and effect would be frustrated by measuring the period of restriction from the date of termination of employment where the employee failed to honor the Restrictive Covenant until directed to do so by court order. [[inventions]] and the Employee agree that, if [[inventions]] is granted preliminary injunctive relief under this Agreement, an injunction bond of no more than SI 00,000 shall be sufficient to indemnify the Employee for any costs or damages that he or she might incur if the Court ultimately determines that the Employee is wrongfully enjoined.

^**Trade Secrets and Confidential Business Information** - The Employee shall not, whether while employed by [[inventions]] or otherwise, disclose or use for the benefit of himself or herself or any other person, partnership, firm, corporation, association, or other legal entity, any of the trade secrets or confidential business information of [[inventions]]

^**Trade Secrets and Confidential Business Information / Remedies** - If legal proceedings should have to be brought by [[inventions]] against the Employee to enforce the confidentiality provisions of paragraph 10 of (his Agreement, the Employee recognizes, acknowledges, and agrees that [[inventions]] shall be entitled to all of the civil remedies provided by Sections 688.01 **et seq.** and 812.035, or appropriate Colorado Statutes, including:

Preliminary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the Employee from any unauthorized disclosure or use of any trade secrets or confidential business information, in whole or in part, and from rendering any service to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, association, or other, legal entity to whom or to which such trade secrets or confidential business information, in whole or in part, has been disclosed or is threatened to be disclosed.
