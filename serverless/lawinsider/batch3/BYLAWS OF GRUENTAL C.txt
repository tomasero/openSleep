^\centered OFFICES

^^Business Office. The principal office and place of business of the corporation is located in the Province of Nevada, [[Address 1: Address]], 89701-1216. Other offices and places of business may be established from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors or as the business of the corporation may require.

^^Registered Office and Registered Agent. The registered agent of the corporation for the service of process in the state of Nevada is Val-[[Organization 2 Name]], Inc. and the registered office of the registered agent for the service of process is 1802 North Carson, Carson City, Nevada, 89701

^^The registered agent of the corporation may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Nevada Business Corporation Act.

^\centered SHARES AND TRANSFER THEREOF

^^Regulation. The Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate concerning the issuance, transfer, and registration of certificates for shares of the corporation, including the appointment of transfer agents and registrars.

^^Stock Certificates: Facsimile Signatures and Validation.

^Every stockholder shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by officers or agents designated by the corporation for the purpose, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the corporation.

^Whenever any certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and by a registrar, then a facsimile of the signatures of the officers or agents of the corporation may be printed or lithographed upon such certificate in lieu of the actual signatures.

^In the event any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature shall have been used on, any certificate or certificates for stock shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation or other reason, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon, had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation.

^^Fractions of Shares: Issuance; Payment of Value or Issuance of Scrip. The corporation is not obligated to, but may, execute and deliver a certificate for or including a fraction of a share. In lieu of executing and delivering a certificate for a fraction of a share, the corporation may, upon resolution of the Board of Directors:

\centered Bylaws of [[Organization 1 Name]] 

\centered Page 1

^make payment to any person otherwise entitled to become a holder of a fractional share, which payment shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada Business Corporation Act; or

^issue such additional fraction of a share as is necessary to increase the fractional share to a full share; or

^execute and deliver registered or bearer scrip over the manual or facsimile signature of an officer of the corporation or of its agent for that purpose, exchangeable as provided on the scrip for full share certificates, but the scrip does not entitle the holder to any rights as a stockholder except as provided on the scrip. The scrip may contain any other provisions or conditions, as permitted by the Nevada Business Corporation Act, that the corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors, deems advisable.

^^Cancellation of Outstanding Certificates and Issuance of New Certificates: Order of Surrender; Penalties for Failure to Comply. All certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof until the former certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled, except as hereinafter provided with respect to lost, stolen or destroyed certificates.

When the Articles of Incorporation are amended in any way affecting the statements contained in the certificates for outstanding shares, or it becomes desirable for any reason, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, to cancel any outstanding certificate for shares and issue a new certificate therefor conforming to the rights of the holder, the Board of Directors may order any holders of outstanding certificates for shares to surrender and exchange them for new certificates within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Board of Directors. Such order may provide that no holder of any such certificate so ordered to be surrendered shall be entitled to vote or to receive dividends or exercise any of the other rights of stockholders of record until he shall have complied with such order, but such order shall only operate to suspend such rights after notice and until compliance. The duty of surrender of any outstanding certificate s may also be enforced by action at law.

^^Consideration for Shares: Types; Adequacy; Effect of Receipt; Actions of Corporation Pending Receipt in Future.

^The Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including, but not limited to, cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.

^Before the corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is adequate. The judgment of the Board of Directors as to the adequacy of the consideration received for the shares issued is conclusive in the absence of actual fraud in the transaction.

^When the corporation receives the consideration for which the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid.

\centered Bylaws of [[Organization 1 Name]] 

\centered Page 2

^The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make any other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares. The corporation may credit distributions made for the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the benefits are received or the promissory note is paid. If the services are not performed, the benefits are not received or the promissory note is not paid, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be canceled in whole or in part.

^^Stockholder's Liability: No Individual Liability Except for Payment for which Shares were Authorized to be Issued or which was Specified in Subscription Agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, no stockholder of the corporation is individually liable for the debts or liabilities of the corporation. A purchaser of shares of stock from the corporation is not liable to the corporation or its creditors with respect to the shares, except to pay the consideration for which the shares were authorized to be issued or which was specified in the written subscription agreement.

^^Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. Any stockholder claiming that his certificate for shares is lost, stolen, or destroyed may make an affidavit or affirmation of the fact and lodge the same with the Secretary of the corporation, accompanied by a signed application for a new certificate. Thereupon, and upon the giving of a satisfactory bond of indemnity to the corporation, a new certificate may be issued of the same tenor and representing the same number of shares as were represented by the certificate alleged to be lost, stolen or destroyed. The necessity for such bond and the amount required to be determined by the President and Treasurer of the corporation, unless the corporation shall have a transfer agent, in which case the transfer agent shall determine the necessity for such bond and the amount required.

^^Transfer of Shares. Subject to the terms of any stockholder agreement relating to the transfer of shares or other transfer restrictions contained in the Articles of Incorporation or authorized therein, shares of the corporation shall be transferable on the books of the corporation by the holder thereof in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon the surrender and cancellation of a certificate or certificates for a like number of shares. Upon presentation and surrender of a certificate for shares properly endorsed and payment of all taxes therefor, the transferee shall be entitled to a new certificate or certificates in lieu thereof. As against the corporation, a transfer of shares can be made only on the books of the corporation and in the manner hereinabove provided, and the corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share as the owner thereof and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Nevada.

^^Restrictions on Transfer of Shares. 

The Corporation will be governed by each of the following restrictions: 

^No shares maybe transferred except with the prior approval of the directors, who 

may in their absolute discretion refuse to register the transfer of any shares, such approval to be evidenced by a resolution of the directors.

^^Transfer Agent. Unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors by resolution, the Secretary of the corporation shall act as transfer agent of the certificates representing the shares of stock of the corporation. He shall maintain a stock transfer book, the stubs of which shall set forth among other things, the names and addresses of the holders of all issued shares of the corporation, the number of shares held by each, the certificate numbers representing such shares, the date of issue of the certificates representing such shares, and whether or not such shares originate from original issue or from transfer. Subject to Section 3.7, the names and addresses of the stockholders as they appear on the stubs of the stock transfer book shall be conclusive evidence as to who are the stockholders of record and as such entitled to receive notice of the meetings of stockholders; to vote at such meetings; to examine the list of the stockholders entitled to vote at meetings; to receive dividends; and to own, enjoy and exercise any other property or rights deriving from such shares against the corporation. Each stockholder shall be responsible for notifying the Secretary in writing of any change in his name or address and failure so to do will relieve the corporation, its directors, officers and agents, from liability for failure to direct notices or other documents, or pay over or transfer dividends or other property or rights, to a name or address other than the name and address appearing on the stub of the stock transfer book.

^^Close of Transfer Book and Record Date. For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may prescribe a period not exceeding sixty (60) days prior to any meeting of the stockholders during which no transfer of stock on the books of the corporation may be made, or may fix a day not more than sixty (60) days prior to the holding of any such meeting as the day as of which stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meetings shall be determined; and only stockholders of record on such day shall be entitled to notice or to vote at such meeting. When a determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been made as provided in this sec tion, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

^\centered STOCKHOLDERS AND MEETINGS THEREOF

\centered Bylaws of [[Organization 1 Name]] 

\centered Page 5

Notice duly delivered or mailed to a stockholder in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed sufficient, and in the event of the transfer of his stock after such delivery or mailing and prior to the holding of the meeting, it shall not be necessary to deliver or mail notice of the meeting upon the transferee.

^Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of Nevada law or the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any stockholder to whom:

^^^Notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to him during the period between those two consecutive annual meetings; or

Any action or meeting taken or held without notice to such a stockholder has the same effect as if the notice had been given. If any such stockholder delivers to the corporation a written notice setting forth his current address, the requirement that notice be given to him is reinstated. 

^^Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to stockholders, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to the notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.

^^Voting Record. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make, at least ten (10) days before such meeting of stockholders, a complete record of the stockholders entitled to vote at each meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each.

In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

\centered Bylaws of [[Organization 1 Name]] 

\centered Page 6

^^Manner of Acting.

^^Stockholders' Proxies.

^At any meeting of the stockholders of the corporation any stockholder may designate another person or persons to act as a proxy or proxies. If any stockholder designates two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of those persons present at the meeting, or, if only one is present, then that one has and may exercise all of the powers conferred by the stockholder upon all of the persons so designated unless the stockholder provides otherwise.

^Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy pursuant to subsection (A), the following constitute valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

^^^^stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the signing of the writing by the stockholder or his authorized officer, director, employee, or agent or by causing the signature of the stockholder to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, a facsimile signature.

^^^^stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a firm that solicits proxies or like agent who is authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission. Any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission is valid, the persons appointed by the corporation to count the votes of stockholders and determine the validity of proxies and ballots or other persons making those determinations must specify the information up on which they relied.

^Any copy, communication by telecopier, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to subsection (B), may be substituted for the original writing or transmission for any purpose for which the original writing or transmission could be used, if the copy, communication by telecopier, or other reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

^No such proxy is valid after the expiration of six (6) months from the date of its creation, unless it is coupled with an interest, or unless the stockholder specifies in it the length of time for which it is to continue in force, which may not exceed seven (7) years from the date of its creation. Subject to these restrictions, any proxy properly created is not revoked and continues in full force and 

\centered Bylaws of [[Organization 1 Name]] 

\centered Page 7

effect until another instrument or transmission revoking it or a properly created proxy bearing a later date is filed with or transmitted to the secretary of the corporation or another person or persons appointed by the corporation to count the votes of stockholders and determine the validity of proxies and ballots.

^^Voting of Shares. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each outstanding share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders, and each fractional share shall be entitled to a corresponding fractional vote on each such matter.

^^Voting by Ballot. Voting on any question or in any election may be by voice vote unless the presiding officer shall order or any stockholder shall demand that voting be by ballot.

^^Cumulative Voting. No stockholder shall be permitted to cumulate his votes in the election of directors or for any other matter voted upon by stockholders.

^^Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting if a written consent thereto is signed by stockholders holding at least a majority of the voting power, except that:

^If any greater proportion of voting power is required for such action at a meeting, then the greater proportion of written consents is required; and

^This general provision for action by written consent does not supersede any specific provision for action by written consent contained in the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or the Nevada Business Corporation Act.

In no instance where action is authorized by written consent need a meeting of stockholders be called or notice given. The written consent must be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the stockholders.

^^Maintenance of Records at Registered Office; Inspection and Copying of Records.

^The corporation shall keep a copy of the following records at its registered office:

^^^^copy certified by the Nevada Secretary of State of its Articles of Incorporation, and all amendments thereto;

^^^^^copy certified by an officer of the corporation of its Bylaws and all amendments thereto; and

^^^^^stock ledger or a duplicate stock ledger, revised annually, containing the names, alphabetically arranged, of all persons who are stockholders of the corporation, showing their places of residence, if known, and the number of shares held by them respectively.

\centered Bylaws of [[Organization 1 Name]] 

\centered Page 8

including street and number, if any, where the stock ledger or duplicate stock ledger specified in this section is kept.

^The corporation shall maintain the records required by subsection (A) in written form or in another form capable of conversion into written form within a reasonable time.

^Any person who has been a stockholder of record of the corporation for at least six (6) months immediately preceding his demand, or any person holding, or thereunto authorized in writing by the holders of, at least 5 percent of all of its outstanding shares, upon at least five (5) days' written demand is entitled to inspect in person or by agent or attorney, during usual business hours, the stock ledger or duplicate stock ledger, whether kept in the registered office of the corporation in Nevada or elsewhere, and to make extracts therefrom. Holders of voting trust certificates representing shares of the corporation must be regarded as stockholders for the purpose of this subsection.

^An inspection authorized by subsection (C) may be denied to a stockholder or other person upon his refusal to furnish to the corporation an affidavit that the inspection is not desired for a purpose which is in the interest of a business or object other than the business of the corporation and that he has not at any time sold or offered for sale any list of stockholders of any domestic or foreign corporation or aided or abetted any person in procuring any such record of stockholders for any such purpose.

^In every instance where an attorney or other agent of the stockholder seeks the right of inspection, the demand must be accompanied by a power of attorney executed by the stockholder authorizing the attorney or other agent to inspect on behalf of the stockholder.

^The right to copy records under subsection (C) includes, if reasonable, the

right to make copies by photographic, photocopy, or other means.

^The corporation may impose a reasonable charge to recover the costs of labor and materials and the cost of copies of any documents provided to the stockholder.

^No contract or other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the corporation and any corporation, firm, or association in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers or are financially interested, is void or voidable solely for this reason or solely because any such director or officer is present at the meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof that authorizes or approves the contract or transaction, or because the vote or votes of common or interested directors are counted for that purpose, if the circumstances specified in any of the following paragraphs exist:

^^^The fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest is disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or committee and noted in the minutes, and the board or committee authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote or votes of the common or interested director or directors.

^^^The fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest is disclosed or known to the stockholders, and they approve or ratify the contract or transaction in good faith by a majority vote of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power. The votes of the common or interested directors or officers must be counted in any such vote of stockholders.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and that, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

^The corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

^To the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in subsections (A) and (B), or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he must be indemnified by the corporation against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.

The provisions of this subsection do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled under any contract or otherwise by law.

^The indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to this section:

^^^Does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Articles of Incorporation or any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, for either an action in his official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding his office, except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to subsection (B) or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to subsection (E), may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that his acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action.
