While any Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent may exercise any one or more of the Administrative Agent’s rights and remedies as hereinafter set forth or as set forth and provided for in each of the other Loan Documents. 

^After Event of Default.

^^While any Event of Default exists (unless the Administrative Agent has waived such Event of Default by written instrument signed by a duly authorized officer of the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State of Illinois, in addition to which the Administrative Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral and/or enforce and collect the Collateral (including, without limitation, the liquidation of debt instruments or securities and the exercise of conversion rights with respect to convertible securities, whether or not such instruments or securities have matured, and whether or not any penalties or other charges are imposed on account of such action) for application towards (but not necessarily in complete satisfaction of) the Obligations. The Pledgor shall remain liable hereunder to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any deficiency remaining following such application.

^^Unless the Collateral is perishable, threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market (in which event the Administrative Agent shall give the Pledgor such notice as may be practicable under the circumstances), the Administrative Agent shall give the Pledgor at least the greater of the minimum notice required by law, or ten (10) days, prior written notice of the date, time and place of any public sale thereof, or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition is to be made.

^^The Pledgor acknowledges that any exercise by the Administrative Agent of the Administrative Agent’s rights upon default will be subject to compliance by the Administrative Agent with the applicable statutes, regulations, ordinances, directives and orders of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental authority including, without limitation, any of the foregoing which may restrict the sale or disposition of securities. The Administrative Agent in its sole discretion at any such sale or in connection with any such disposition may restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers as to their number, nature of business, investment intention, or otherwise, including, without limitation a requirement that the persons making such purchases represent and agree to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent that they are purchasing the Collateral, or some portion thereof, for their own account, for investment and not with a view towards the distribution or a sale thereof, or that they otherwise fall within some lawful exemption from registration under applicable laws.

^^The proceeds of any collection or of any sale or disposition of the Collateral, or any portion thereof, held pursuant to this Agreement shall be applied towards the Obligations in such order and manner as the Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion, any statute, custom or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.

^^While any Event of Default exists (unless the Administrative Agent has waived such Event of Default by written instrument signed by a duly authorized officer of the Administrative Agent), the Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that the Pledgor shall no longer have any right to undertake any action in accordance with the Organizational Documents and further acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent may undertake any action in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents.

^Actions By Administrative Agent. The Pledgor hereby designates, effective only during the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, or any agent designated by the Administrative Agent, as the attorney-in-fact of the Pledgor to: (a) endorse in favor of the Administrative Agent any of the Collateral; (b) cause the transfer of any of the Collateral in such name as the Administrative Agent may from time to time determine; (c) cause the issuance of certificates for book entry and/or uncertificated securities; (d) renew, extend or roll over any Collateral; and (e) make, demand and initiate actions to enforce any of the Collateral or rights therein. The Administrative Agent may take such action with respect to the Collateral as the Administrative Agent may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect and preserve its interest in the Collateral. While an Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent shall also have all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions of the Pledgor with respect to and under the Collateral; *provided, however*, the Administrative Agent shall have no right to exercise any voting rights available to holders of the Collateral at any time the Collateral is held by the Administrative Agent solely as secured party hereunder unless an Event of Default exists (and has not been waived by the Administrative Agent as set forth above). All of the rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions included in this Section 9, other than voting rights, may be exercised by the Administrative Agent whether or not the Obligations are then due and only while an Event of Default exists.

The power of attorney shall not be affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of the Pledgor. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission to act pursuant to this Section 9, except for any act or omission to act which is in actual bad faith or is grossly negligent.

^Rights and Remedies. The rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions of the Administrative Agent hereunder (the “Rights and Remedies”) shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers, privileges or discretions which it may otherwise have. No delay or omission by the Administrative Agent in exercising or enforcing any of the rights and remedies shall operate as, or constitute, a waiver thereof. No waiver by the Administrative Agent of any Default or any Event of Default or of any default under any other agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other default hereunder or under any other of the Loan Documents. No exercise of any of the Rights and Remedies and no other agreement or transaction of whatever nature entered into between the Administrative Agent and the Pledgor at any time shall preclude any other exercise of the Rights and Remedies. No waiver by the Administrative Agent of any of the Rights and Remedies on any one occasion shall be deemed a waiver on any subsequent occasion nor shall it be deemed a continuing waiver. All of the Rights and Remedies and all of the Administrative Agent’s rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions under any other agreement or transaction are cumulative and not alternative or exclusive and may be exercised by the Administrative Agent at such time or times in such order of preference as the Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion may determine.

^Pledgor’s Consent and Waiver. The Pledgor agrees that the Administrative Agent may enforce its rights as against the Pledgor, the Collateral, or as against any other party liable for the obligations, or as against any other collateral given for any of the Obligations, in any order or in such combination as the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion determine, and the Pledgor hereby expressly waives all suretyship defenses and defenses in the nature thereof, agrees to the release or substitution of any collateral hereunder or otherwise, and consents to each and all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the other Loan Documents.

^Administrative Agent May Assign. The Pledgor agrees that upon any sale or transfer by the Administrative Agent of the Loan Documents and the indebtedness evidenced thereby, the Administrative Agent may deliver to the purchaser or transferee the Collateral, who shall thereupon become vested with all powers and rights given to the Administrative Agent in respect thereto, and the Administrative Agent shall be thereafter forever relieved and fully discharged from any liability or responsibility in connection therewith.

^Limits on Administrative Agent’s Duties. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or any income or distribution thereon, beyond the safe custody of such of the Collateral as may come into the actual possession of the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto.
