^**Gender and Number**. In this Agreement, whenever the context so requires, the neuter gender includes the feminine and/or masculine, as the case may be and the singular number includes the plural.

^**Binding Effect**. The terms, conditions, covenants, agreements, powers, privileges, notices and authorizations herein contained shall extend to, be binding upon and available for the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and, to the extent permitted hereunder, to the assigns of each of the respective parties hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower will not assign or transfer voluntarily or by operation of law, or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any monies, property or funds deposited with Lender. An assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be invalid, and an assignment or transfer by operation of law shall be deemed to be an invalid transfer.

^**Time of Essence**. It is specifically agreed that in all cases, time is of the essence of this Agreement.

^**Assignment by Lender*****.*** Lender may at any time, and from time to time, as it may deem appropriate, assign in whole or in part, or issue participation interests in and to all of its rights and interests under this Agreement, the Note, and any other Loan Documents. In such event, this Agreement shall continue to apply to the Credit Facility, the Note, and Loan Documents. In the event of such assignment, it shall be deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and not to be in modification hereof and advances made by any such assignee shall be evidenced and secured by the Note and other Loan Documents. Borrower acknowledges that any payments made by it in partial or complete discharge of the Credit Facility to any agent other than the owner and holder of the Loan Documents and Note of record shall constitute a payment of Borrower's agent and not to the owner and holder of the Note or its agents; such payment shall be deemed not to have been properly made, and Lender shall not be required to release or discharge the Loan Documents, the Note, or any of the Collateral in satisfaction of the Obligation pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents and the Note.

^**Assignment by Borrower**. This Agreement may not be assigned by Borrower without the prior written consent of Lender. In the event that Lender approves any such assignment, Lender shall be entitled to make advances to such assignee and such advances shall be evidenced by the Note and the other Loan Documents. Borrower shall remain liable for payment of all sums advanced hereunder before and after such assignment.

^**Severance**. In the event any one or more of the provisions or terms of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be unenforceable in any respect, such unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

^**Claims Against Lender**. No action shall be commenced by Borrower for any claim against Lender under the terms of this Agreement unless written notice thereof, specifically setting forth Borrower's claim, shall have been given to Lender within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of the event or omission which Borrower alleges gave rise to any such claim, and failure to give such notice shall constitute a waiver of any such claim. The liability of Lender to Borrower for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by Lender shall not exceed a sum equal to the amount which Lender shall have failed to advance in consequence of a breach by Lender of its obligations under this Agreement and, upon the making of any such payment by Lender to Borrower, the same shall be treated as an advance under this Agreement in the same fashion as any other advance under the terms of this Agreement.

^**Headings**. Any captions or headings of the articles, sections and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience and reference and are not to be considered a part hereof and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions or terms hereof.

^**Interpretation**. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party hereto by any court or other governmental or judicial authority by reason of such person having or being deemed to have structured or dictated such provision.

^**Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the parties or signatories hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

^**Governing Law**. This Agreement and each transaction consummated hereunder shall be deemed to be made under the laws of the State of Florida, ***excepting, however***, its laws or rule regarding conflicts of laws or choice of laws, and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of such state.

^**Acceptance**. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, shall not become effective and until delivered to Lender and accepted in writing by Lender, as evidenced by its execution hereof (notice of which delivery and acceptance are hereby waived by Borrower).

^**Cure of Defaults by Lender.** If, hereafter, Borrower defaults in the performance of any duty or obligation to Lender hereunder, Lender may, at its option, but without obligation, cure such default and any cost, fees and expenses incurred by Lender in connection therewith including, without limitation, for the purchase of insurance, the payment of taxes and the removal or settlement of liens and claims, shall be added to the indebtedness evidenced by the Note and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

^**Sole Benefit**. The rights and benefits set forth in this Agreement and in all the other Loan Documents are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties thereto and may be relied upon only by them.

^**Meaning of Particular Words**. Any reference herein to "attorneys' fees" or "attorney's fees" shall be deemed to also include hourly charges for paralegals, law clerks and other staff members operating under the supervision of an attorney. Any award or payment of attorneys' fees shall also include any and all sales and/or use taxes imposed thereon by any appropriate governmental authority.

^**Execution Under Seal**. This Agreement is being executed under seal by Borrower.

^**Notice of Final Agreement. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.**
