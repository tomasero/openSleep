In addition to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the following supplemental terms and conditions will apply to all Internet Transactions. To the extent that any such terms and conditions conflict with the terms and conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the terms and conditions in this Appendix will control.

^Internet Applications; Link to Bank Webpage. Retailer may begin linking customers that visit the Retailer Website to the Bank Webpage to submit Internet Applications to Bank only on or after the date (the “Internet Application Start Date”) when mutually agreeable procedures for Internet Applications have been established and Retailer and Bank have agreed in writing that they wish to begin processing Internet Applications. During the Internet Application Period, Retailer shall maintain on the Retailer Website, an imbedded link to a webpage hosted by Bank or its agent (the “Bank Webpage”). The link shall link directly to the Bank Webpage with no intermediate links. If for any reason during the Internet Application Period such link shall cease to be displayed on the Retailer Website, Retailer shall immediately notify Bank. Retailer shall not permit any link to the Bank Webpage to exist: (i) on the Retailer Website at any time other than during the Internet Application Period; or (ii) on any internet website (other than the Retailer Website) maintained, operated or controlled by Retailer or under any Retailer Mark (an “Other Retailer Website”).

[[Organization 6 Name]] shall have the sole right to determine the design and content of the Bank Webpage. During the Internet Application Period: (i) Bank shall maintain and operate the Bank Webpage; (ii) Retailer shall use reasonable efforts to conform the Retailer Website to be reasonably compatible with the Bank Webpage technology; and (iii) Bank shall provide to Retailer ninety (90) days prior notification of any planned changes in the Bank Webpage that would require any changes in the Retailer Website.

^Internet Purchases; Link to Authorization Technology. Retailer may begin submitting Internet Purchases to Bank only on or after the date (the “Internet Purchase Start Date”) when mutually agreeable procedures for Internet Purchases have been established and Retailer and Bank have agreed in writing that they wish to begin processing Internet Purchases. At all times during the Internet Purchase Period, Retailer shall design, maintain and operate the Retailer Website so that use of the Credit Card will be a payment option. Retailer acknowledges that all Internet Purchases shall be authorized through payment authorization technology selected by Bank (the “Payment Authorization Technology”). Bank shall hold harmless and indemnify Retailer from any Damages incurred by Retailer as a result of a failure, claim or an alleged failure by third parties associated with the Payment Authorization Technology. During the Internet Purchase Period: (i) Retailer shall use reasonable efforts to conform the Retailer Website to be reasonably compatible with the Payment Authorization Technology; and (ii) Bank shall provide to Retailer ninety (90) days prior notification of any planned changes in the Payment Authorization Technology that would require any changes in the Retailer Website.

Retailer will process all Internet Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Operating Procedures, and any specific procedures governing Internet Transactions developed by Bank and Retailer. Without limiting the foregoing, Retailer will cause all authorizations processed through the internet and all Internet Purchases to be separately tagged with a unique store of sale number. The parties acknowledge that the infrastructure required for Internet Transactions is dynamic and agree to cooperate in implementing enhancements and developments with respect to the operation and security of Internet Transaction processing under the 

Program. For the avoidance of doubt, the settlement procedures set forth in Section 3.1 of the Agreement shall apply to Internet Purchases.

^Security.

For its part, Bank agrees that the direct access medium or method used to store, present or transmit Internet Applications, terms and conditions, and/or Account information will be secured in a manner where such information cannot be altered, viewed or captured by an unauthorized party.

^Fraud Mitigation. Retailer and Bank agree to cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner by committing systems and other resources, and by providing information with respect to the development, establishment and implementation of fraud mitigation strategies in connection with Internet Transactions. Retailer and Bank further agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement such mitigation strategies as are developed from time to time.

^Reprice Right. In the event that Net Program Sales with respect to Internet Purchases are (i) greater than forty percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) of all Net Program Sales in any one (1) month period or (ii) greater than five percent ([[Percentage 2: Number]]%) of all Net Program Sales in any twelve (12) month period, then the parties shall review the performance of the internet channel. Bank shall have the right to propose changes to the criteria for accepting Internet Applications or to the Program Fee Percentages applicable to Internet Purchases. If Retailer does not agree to any changes proposed by Bank, then Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, upon not less than 15 days written notice to Retailer, to discontinue submitting, accepting or processing Internet Applications and/or Internet Purchases. The foregoing shall not be construed to limit or restrict either party’s rights pursuant to Section H below.
