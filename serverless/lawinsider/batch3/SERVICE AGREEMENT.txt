^^Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws and decisions of the state of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state

^^Mediation. In the event of a dispute between the parties, which cannot be resolved in the course of ordinary business, either party may submit a written request for a meeting of senior executives to resolve such dispute. In the event that such a request is submitted, the receiving party shall make a senior executive available to discuss the matter within 10 business days. If the matter is not resolved by such meeting, either party may send a written request that the dispute be submitted to mediation. Such request shall include the names of at least three U.S.-based mediators or mediation services, each of which must have appropriate professional training and experience in business mediation. The parties shall work in good faith to agree on a mediator within five business days of receipt of the request, and the mediation shall be scheduled as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case within 30 days of receipt of the request. The mediation shall occur in the principal office city of the request recipient. All costs of mediation shall be borne equally by the parties. In the event that a mutually agreeable resolution cannot be reached through mediation, either party may proceed to use the courts or other legal methods to achieve resolution. Nothing in this Section 19.3 shall be construed as preventing either party from using the courts directly and immediately for injunctive relief pursuant to Section 16 in the event that imminent harm is threatened, or as preventing either party from proceeding to litigation in the event that mediation is unsuccessful
