**Exhibit 5.2**    

\centered **CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF [[Parent]] 

[[Parent]] (the "**Company**"), a corporation organized and existing under the Texas Business Organization Code (the "**TBOC**"), does hereby certify that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company by the Certificate of Formation, of the Company, and pursuant to the TBOC, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions (i) designating a series of the Company's previously authorized preferred stock, without par value per share, and (ii) providing for the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of Forty Nine Thousand One Hundred Sixteen ([[Shares 1: Number]]) shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, as follows: 

RESOLVED, that the Company is authorized to issue 49,116 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "**Preferred Shares**"), without par value per share, which shall have the following powers, designations, preferences and other special rights: 

^*Dividends.* The holders of the Preferred Shares (each, a "**Holder**" and collectively, the "**Holders**") shall be entitled to receive dividends ("**Dividends**") payable in cash on the Stated Value (as defined below) of such Preferred Share at the Dividend Rate (as defined below), which shall be cumulative. Dividends on the Preferred Shares shall commence accruing on the Initial Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. To the extent permitted by law, Dividends shall be payable (a) in arrears on the last day of each Calendar Quarter (each, an "**Dividend Date**") with the first Dividend Date being [[Date 5: Date]], (b) on each Conversion Date thereafter by inclusion in the applicable Conversion Amount (as defined below) and (c) on the Maturity Date (as defined below) (each, a "**Dividend Date**"). If a Dividend Date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the Dividend shall be due and payable on the Business Day immediately following such Dividend Date. On each Dividend Date, if the Company does not have current or accumulated "earnings and profits" within the meaning of Sections 301 and 312 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, through such Dividend Date, the Company shall not withhold any amount of the applicable Dividend in respect of U.S. federal income tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Electing Holder the Company shall not pay any Dividends in cash on the Dividend Date but instead such Dividends shall be included in the calculation of such Holder's Conversion Amount for purposes of any conversion or redemption hereunder. 

^*Conversion of Preferred Shares.* Preferred Shares shall be convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $[[USD Value 1: Number]] per share (the "**Common Stock**"), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2. 

\centered *Conversion Amount* Conversion Price 

equal to the quotient of (X) the aggregate amount of the damages payments described herein divided by (Y) the Conversion Price in effect on such Conversion Date as specified by the Holder in the Conversion Notice or in effect on the Company Delivery Date. In addition to the foregoing, if (i) on the Share Delivery Date or (ii) on any Company Delivery Date, the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to a Holder or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion or the Company's Conversion, as applicable, of Preferred Shares, and if on or after such Trading Day the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion that the Holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a  **"Buy-In"**), then the Company shall, within three (3) Trading Days after the Holder's request and in the Holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (the **"Buy-In Price"**), at which point the Company's obligation to deliver such certificate (and to issue such Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Common Stock and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the Closing Sale Price on the Conversion Date or the Company Delivery Date, as applicable. 

^*Redemption at Option of Holders.* 

^*Other Rights of Holders.* 

^*Reservation of Shares.* 

^*Voting Rights.* Subject to Sections 7 and 10, each Holder shall be entitled to the whole number of votes equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Holder's Preferred Shares would be convertible based on the Conversion Price on the record date for the vote or consent of stockholders, and shall otherwise have voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Holder's Preferred Shares would be convertible if the Conversion Price on the record date for the vote or consent of stockholders is deemed to be the Market Price. Each Holder shall be entitled to receive the same prior notice of any stockholders' meeting as is provided to the holders of Common Stock in accordance with the bylaws of the Company, as well as prior notice of all stockholder actions to be taken by legally available means in lieu of a meeting, and shall vote as a class with the holders of Common Stock as if they were a single class of securities upon any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, except those matters required by law or by the terms hereof to be submitted to a class vote of the Holders of Preferred Shares, in which case the Holders of Preferred Shares only shall vote as a separate class. affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any notes or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section beneficially owned by such Person or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 7, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this Section 7, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1) the Company's most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-KSB, Form 10-Q, Form 10-QSB or Form 8-K, as the case may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company, or (3) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day following the receipt of such notice, confirm orally and in writing to any such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including the Preferred Shares, by such Holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. By written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of [[Percentage 1: Number]]% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder providing such written notice and not to any other Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has elected "no limit" on *Exhibit E* to the Investors Rights Agreement, the limitations set forth in this Section 7 shall not be applicable to such Holder. 

^*Change of Control Redemption Right; Liquidation, Dissolution, Winding-Up.* 

^*Ranking; Issuances of Other Securities.* 

^*Limitation on Number of Conversion Shares.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Shares if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon conversion of the Preferred Shares without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market, or the market or exchange where the Common Stock is then traded (the "**Exchange Cap**"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (a) obtains stockholder approval as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market (and any successor rule or regulation) for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount, or (b) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no Holder on the Initial Issuance Date (the "**Purchasers**") shall be issued, in the aggregate, upon conversion of Preferred Shares, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of (i) the Exchange Cap amount multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Preferred Shares owned by such Purchaser on the Initial Issuance Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of all of the Preferred Shares owned by all of the Purchasers on the Initial Issuance Date (the "**Exchange Cap Allocation**"). In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchaser's Preferred Shares, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchaser's Exchange Cap Allocation. In the event that any Holder shall convert all of such Holder's Preferred Shares into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such Holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such Holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such Holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining Holders on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Preferred Shares then held by each such Holder. 

^*Participation.* Subject to the rights of the holders, if any, of the Pari Passu Shares, the Holders shall, as holders of Preferred Stock, be entitled to such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of Common Stock to the same extent as if such Holders had converted the Preferred Shares into Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of Common Stock. Following the occurrence of a Liquidation Event and the payment in full to a Holder of its applicable liquidation preference, such Holder shall cease to have any rights hereunder to participate in any future dividends or distributions made to the holders of Common Stock. 

^*Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares.* Except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting together as a single class, shall be required before the Company may: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any articles of amendment, certificate of designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of any series of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Preferred Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of shares of Preferred Shares; (c) create or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares that has a preference over or is on a parity with the Preferred Shares with respect to dividends or the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to equity incentive agreements with employees giving the Company the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services at cost); (e) pay dividends or make any other distribution on the Common Stock; or (f) whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares. 

^*Lost or Stolen Certificates.* Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Preferred Stock Certificates representing the Preferred Shares, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the Preferred Stock Certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new preferred stock certificate(s) of like tenor and date; *provided*, *however*, the Company shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates if the Holder contemporaneously requests the Company to convert such Preferred Shares into Common Stock. 

^*Remedies, Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief.* Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief). Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, no remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designations. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the Holder thereof and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the Holders shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Holder shall be entitled to consequential, indirect or incidental damages hereunder. However, the foregoing shall not in any way limit a Holder from being reimbursed for its costs, fees or expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements in connection with any of its rights and remedies hereunder. 

^*Construction.* This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and all Holders and shall not be construed against any person as the drafter hereof. 

^*Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver.* No failure or delay on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. 

^*Notice.* Whenever notice or other communication is required to be given under this Certificate of Designations, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with Section 13(b) of the Investors Rights Agreement. 

^*Transfer of Preferred Shares.* A Holder may assign some or all of the Preferred Shares and the accompanying rights hereunder held by such Holder without the consent of the Company; *provided* that such assignment is in compliance with applicable securities laws. 

^*Preferred Share Register.* The Company shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice to the Holders), a register for the Preferred Shares, in which the Company shall record the name and address of the persons in whose name the Preferred Shares have been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee. The Company may treat the person in whose name any Preferred Share is registered on the register as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, but in all events recognizing any properly made transfers. 

^*Stockholder Matters.* Any stockholder action, approval or consent required, desired or otherwise sought by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market, the TBOC, this Certificate of Designations or otherwise with respect to the issuance of the Preferred Shares or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof may be effected by written consent of the Company's stockholders or at a duly called meeting of the Company's stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Principal Market and the TBOC. This provision is intended to comply with the applicable sections of the TBOC permitting stockholder action, approval and consent affected by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 

^*Disclosure.* Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any notice in accordance with the terms of this Certificate of Designations, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to such notice do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day after any such receipt or delivery publicly disclose such material, nonpublic information on a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to the Holders contemporaneously with delivery of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holders shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to such notice do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

^**SUBORDINATION.** 

^^NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, DOCUMENT, CERTIFICATE, OR INSTRUMENT GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH, RELATED TO OR AFFECTING THE PREFERRED SHARES, the Company's obligation to make, and the Holders right to receive, any dividend or distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) or any direct or indirect payment of any kind or character (whether in cash, securities or other property) in consideration for or otherwise in connection the Preferred Shares, including, without limitation, any amortization, retirement, purchase, redemption or other acquisition of any Preferred Share, or any options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any Preferred Shares or Common Stock of the Company (collectively, the "**Restricted Payments**") are strictly junior and fully subordinated to the right of payment held by the holders of the Senior Debt (the "**Senior Debt Holders**").

All references in this clause 22 to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall include such entity as a debtor-in-possession and any receiver or trustee for such entity in any Insolvency Proceeding. 

^^As between the Holders and the Senior Debt Holders and without releasing or affecting any of its senior rights as to the Holders, any Senior Debt Holder may, one or more times, in its sole discretion, without notice to or the consent of any Holder, take any action with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Senior Debt, including, without limitation, one or more of the following actions: (i) extend credit to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such amounts as such Senior Debt Holder may determine or withhold credit from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) release, renew or modify the obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person or entity obligated on any of the Senior Debt; (c) release, exchange, modify, or surrender in whole or in part such Senior Debt Holder's rights with respect to any security for any of the Senior Debt; (d) modify or alter the term, interest rate or due date of any payment of any of the Senior Debt; (e) grant any postponements, compromises, indulgences, waivers, surrenders or discharges or modify the terms of its agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (f) change its manner of doing business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person or entity; (g) obtain additional security for the Senior Debt; or (h) impute payments or proceeds of any security furnished for any of the Senior Debt, in whole or in part, to any of the Senior Debt, or retain the payments or proceeds as security for the Senior Debt without applying same toward payment of the Senior Debt. **Each Holder waives and releases all claims and defenses arising from any such actions by any holder of Senior Debt, including, without limitation, claims and defenses relating to the inability to collect any Restricted Payment**. No Senior Debt Holder will be liable for any action or failure to act under or in connection with any of the documents or instruments evidencing or securing the Senior Debt, it being understood that the decision of whether and when to act and the manner of proceeding under such instruments and documents are within the sole discretion of such Senior Debt Holders, and shall not be affected in any manner by the existence of the Company's obligations hereunder. 

^^For purposes hereof, "**Payment in Full of the Senior Debt**" means the satisfaction of all of the following: (i) the passage of 90 days after the indefeasible and final payment in full in cash of the Senior Debt, (ii) the termination of all hedging transactions with any Senior Debt Holder, (iii) the termination or expiration of all commitments of each Senior Debt Holder to advance funds or issue letters of credit, and (iv) the termination or expiration and return of all letters of credit issued by any Senior Debt Holder.
