Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of Borrowers hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required, for any period for which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to Lender 

limiting the highest rate of interest which may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by Lender, and in such event Borrowers shall pay Lender interest at the Highest Lawful Rate.

If any suit or action is instituted or attorneys are employed to collect this Revolving Note or any part thereof, each Borrower hereby promises and agrees to pay all costs of collection, including attorneys’ fees and court costs.
