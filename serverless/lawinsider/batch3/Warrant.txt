The Company has agreed to register the Common Stock with respect to which this Warrant may be exercisable for distribution in accordance with the provisions of the Act pursuant to a registration statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on or before [[Date 2: Date]].

^Adjustments. The number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of any of the events enumerated below.

^^In case the Company shall: (i) pay a dividend in Shares, (ii) subdivide its outstanding Shares into a greater number of Shares, (iii) combine its outstanding Shares into a smaller number of Shares, or (iv) issue, by reclassification of its Shares, any shares of its capital stock, the amount of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Warrant that number of Shares which such Holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of such event had such Holder exercised the Warrant immediately prior to the record date, in the case of such dividend, or the effective date, in the case of any such subdivision, combination or reclassification. An adjustment made pursuant to this subsecti on (a) shall be made whenever any of such events shall occur, but shall become effective retroactively after such record date or such effective date, as the case may be, as to Warrants exercised between such record date or effective date and the date of happening of any such event.

^^No adjustment shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least [[Percentage 1: Number]]% in the number of Shares purchasable hereunder; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection (d) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 6 shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of a Share.

^^No adjustment shall be made in any of the following cases:

^^^Upon the grant or exercise of stock options now or hereafter granted, or under any employee stock option or stock purchase plan now or hereafter authorized, to the extent that the aggregate of the number of Shares which may be purchased under such options and the number of Shares issued under such employee stock purchase plan is less than or equal to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the number of Shares outstanding on [[Date 3: Date]] of the year of the grant or exercise;

^^^Shares issued upon the conversion of any of the Company's convertible or exchangeable securities;

^^^Shares issued in connection with the acquisition by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company of [[Percentage 3: Number]]% or more of the assets of another corporation or entity, and Shares issued in connection with the acquisition by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company of [[Percentage 3]]% or more of the voting shares of another corporation (including Shares issued in connection with such acquisition of voting shares of such other corporation subsequent to the acquisition of an aggregate of [[Percentage 3]]% of such voting shares), Shares issued in a merger of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company with another corporation in which the Company or the Company's subsidiary is the surviving corporation, and Shares issued upon the conversion of other securities issued in connection with any such acquisition or in any such merger; and

^^^Shares issued pursuant to this Warrant and pursuant to all stock options and warrants outstanding on the date hereof.

^^Notice to Warrant Holders of Adjustment. Whenever the number of Shares purchasable hereunder is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6 a notice (i) stating that the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant have been adjusted, (ii) setting forth the adjusted number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of a Warrant, and (iii) showing in reasonable detail the computations and the facts, including the amount of consideration received or deemed to have been received by the Company, upon which such adjustments are based.

^Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue any fraction of a Share upon the exercise of Warrants. If more than one Warrant shall be surrendered for exercise at one time by the same Holder, the number of full Shares which shall be issuable upon exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which this Warrant is exercised. If any fractional interest in a Share shall be deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall make an adjustment therefor in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Current Market Price of the Shares on the business day next preceding the day of exercise.

^Loss or Destruction. Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this Warrant Certificate and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement or bond satisfactory in form, substance and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant Certificate, the Company at its expense will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor.

^Survival. The various rights and obligations of the Holder hereof as set forth herein shall survive the exercise of the Warrants represented hereby and the surrender of this Warrant Certificate.

^Notices. Whenever any notice, payment of any purchase price, or other communication is required to be given or delivered under the terms of this Warrant, it shall be in writing and delivered by hand delivery or United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and will be deemed to have been given or delivered on the date such notice, purchase price or other communication is so delivered or posted, as the case may be; and, if to the Company, it will be addressed to the address specified in Section 1 hereof, and if to the Holder, it will be addressed to the registered Holder at its, his or her address as it appears on the books of the Company.
