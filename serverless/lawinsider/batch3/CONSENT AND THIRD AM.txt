ANNEX A 

FORM OF SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE 

\centered **SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE** 

The undersigned hereby certifies that the undersigned is (a) the Chief Financial Officer of [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), (b) authorized to certify as to the financial statements of the Borrower and each other Credit Party, (c) familiar with the properties, business and assets of the Borrower and each other Credit Party, and (d) authorized to execute and deliver this Certificate on behalf of the Borrower and each other Credit Party. The undersigned further certifies that the undersigned has carefully reviewed the contents of this Certificate and, in connection herewith, has made such investigations and inquiries as the undersigned deemed necessary and prudent. The undersigned further certifies that the undersigned believes that the financial information and assumptions which underlie and form the basis for the representations made in this Certificate were reasonable when made and continue to be reasonable as of the date hereof. Capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement dated as of [[Date 2]] (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”) among the Borrower, the financial institutions party thereto (the “Lenders”) and [[Organization 2 Name]], as agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”), are used herein as so defined. This Certificate is required to be delivered pursuant to the requirements of Section 3 of that certain Consent and Third Amendment to Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement dated as of [[Date 1]] in connection with the Permitted Payments referred to and defined therein. The undersigned hereby further certifies, on behalf of the Credit Parties and not in my individual capacity, that: 

^: Immediately prior to and after giving effect to the Permitted Payments and the borrowing of any Loans in connection therewith, with respect to each of the Borrower and the Credit Parties, taken as a whole: 

^^the fair value of its assets (taken as a going concern based on the price available upon the sale of such assets of such Credit Party by a willing seller to a willing buyer, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable knowledge of the material facts, with neither being under any compulsion to act) is greater than the amount of its liabilities (including reasonably likely disputed, contingent and unliquidated liabilities); 

^^the present fair saleable value of its assets (taken as a going concern based on the price available upon the sale of such assets of such Credit Party by a willing seller to a willing buyer, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having reasonable knowledge of the material facts, with neither being under any compulsion to act) is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured; 

^^it is able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and other liabilities (including reasonably likely disputed, contingent and unliquidated liabilities) as they mature in the normal course of business; 

^^it does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay as such debts and liabilities mature; and 

^^it is not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about to engage in business or a transaction, for which its property would constitute unreasonably small capital. 

^In reaching the conclusions set forth in this Certificate, the undersigned has considered, among other things: 

^^after giving effect to the Permitted Payments, the cash and other current assets of the Borrower and each other Credit Party; 

^^after giving effect to the Permitted Payments, refinancing or other replacements of existing liabilities, debts, obligations and commitments which the Borrower and each other Credit Party, as applicable, reasonably expects will be available on the dates of their respective maturities; 

^^after giving effect to the Permitted Payments, the estimated value of all property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of the Borrower and each other Credit Party, as applicable; 

^^all available audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries; 

^^after giving effect to the Permitted Payments, all reasonably likely liabilities of the Borrower and each other Credit Party known to the undersigned on all claims, whether or not reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, unsecured, fixed or contingent, including, among other things, claims arising out of pending or, to the undersigned’s knowledge, threatened litigation against the Borrower and each other Credit Party; 

^^historical growth in revenues and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, certain pro forma financial information of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Borrower’s and each of its Subsidiary’s business plans, all as previously delivered to the Agent and the Lenders; 

^^customary terms of trade payables in the industry, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; 

^^the amount of credit extended to customers of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; and 

^^after giving effect to the Permitted Payments, the amount of equity capital of the Borrower and each other Credit Party.
