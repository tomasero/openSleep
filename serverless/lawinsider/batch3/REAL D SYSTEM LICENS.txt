^^Injunctive Relief.

Each party may change its address for receipt of notices by giving notice of the new address to the other party.

^^Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or is so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.

^^Jointly Drafted; Review by Counsel. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and have had the opportunity to review this Agreement with counsel of their choosing.

It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter, including without limitation both the Prior License Agreement, as well as that certain Letter of Intent previously entered into by and between REAL D and Licensee in [[Date 4: Date]]. Neither this Agreement nor the Schedules can be altered, amended or modified except in writing executed by both parties. The failure of a party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party to thereafter enforce that provision or any other provision or right.
