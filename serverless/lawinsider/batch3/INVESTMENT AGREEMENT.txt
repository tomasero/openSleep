Upon Hess’s determination that Hess Money Spent during Phase 2 equals $[[USD Value 4]] (seventy million dollars) (as may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.5(b)), Hess shall deliver prompt written notice to Toreador setting forth in detail its proposed calculation of the Hess Money Spent during Phase 2 (the “**Phase 2 Completion Notice**”). Toreador shall have forty-five (45) calendar days from receipt thereof to deliver to Hess notice of any objection to the calculation of Hess Money Spent during Phase 2 as set forth in the Phase 2 Completion Notice. Any dispute relating to the determination of whether Hess Money Spent during Phase 2 equals $[[USD Value 4]] (seventy million dollars) (as may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.5(b)) shall be resolved in accordance with Section 14.3. At any time during Phase 2, Toreador shall have the right at its cost to audit the proposed Hess Money Spent during Phase 2.

For the avoidance of doubt, no payment or any other consideration shall be due to Hess as a result of this Section 3.5(c). *Toreador shall not be entitled to any remedy under French law or under this Agreement other than the remedy set out in this Section 3.5(c) unless in the event of gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct*.

^^In the event Hess Money Spent does not equal or exceed $[[USD Value 4]] (seventy million dollars) (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.5(b)) by the Phase 2 Completion Deadline for reasons which are beyond Hess’s control and which can be qualified as Force Majeure, the Phase 2 Completion Deadline shall, subject to the terms of this provision, be extended for the period of time for which Phase 2 has been suspended because Hess has been prevented or hindered from completing Phase 2 Work as a result of Force Majeure. In order to claim Force Majeure Hess shall notify Toreador in writing of the Force Majeure promptly after the occurrence of the facts relied on and shall keep Toreador informed in writing of all significant developments. Such notice shall give reasonably detailed particulars of the Force Majeure and also estimate the period of time which Hess reasonably believes will be required to remedy the Force Majeure. Hess shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove or overcome the Force Majeure situation as promptly as possible. If the period of time for which a Force Majeure is continuing exceeds six (6) months and Toreador is able to perform, or cause the performance of, the work required under the Work Program, Toreador may, in its sole discretion, be entitled to perform, or cause to be performed, such work at the sole cost and expense of Hess.

Hess acknowledges that Toreador is entering into this Agreement in consideration that Hess is irrevocably bound by such transfer obligations under the terms and conditions of Sections 3.3(d), 3.4(b) and 3.5(c) and hereby irrevocably waives its right to revoke these transfer obligations and renounces the provisions of Article 1142 of the French Civil Code. As a result, the Parties agree that should Hess fail to perform such transfer obligations in accordance with Sections 3.3(d), 3.4(b) and 3.5(c), Toreador shall be entitled to obtain enforcement (*exécution forcée*) of such transfer obligations, without prejudice to its right to obtain damages for loss suffered from this failure by Hess to perform such transfer-back obligation.

If the Non-Acquiring Party elects not to join the Acquiring Party in making such an application, Section 5.2 shall not apply; provided, however, that if the French Administration subsequently proposes a substantive change to the application, then the Acquiring Party must give a new notice to the Non-Acquiring Party in accordance with this Section 5.4.

^^Any permit jointly obtained in accordance with this Section 5 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation for purposes of Section 8.

^**TERMINATION**

^^If Government Approval is refused for each and every Wholly Owned Permit, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, and Toreador shall repay to Hess within thirty (30) calendar days the Acquisition Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Hess in writing. The Working Interest Assignments shall thereafter have no force or effect, and Hess shall have no Transfer Working Interest whatsoever in the Permits and shall be deemed to have reassigned any rights or equitable interest it may have acquired under this Agreement to Toreador retroactive to the date of this Agreement.

^^If Government Approval is obtained for at least one but not all the Wholly Owned Permits, Hess shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to Toreador, such right of termination expiring fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which Government Approval (or refusal, as the case may be) for the last of the Wholly Owned Permits is obtained. If Hess exercises such termination right, Toreador shall, within ninety (90) calendar days after such termination of this Agreement, reimburse Hess for (a) Hess Money Spent until the date on which Government Approval (or refusal, as the case may be) for the last of the Wholly Owned Permits is obtained (with interest calculated as EUROLIBOR three (3) months rate plus four (4.0) percentage points) and (b) the Acquisition Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Hess in writing. The Working Interest Assignments shall have no force or effect, and Hess shall thereafter have no Transfer Working Interest whatsoever in the Permits and shall be deemed to have reassigned any rights or equitable interest it may have acquired under this Agreement to Toreador retroactive to the date of this Agreement.

^^Subject to Sections 3.3(e) and 3.5(d), Toreador may terminate this Agreement if (a) Hess Money Spent does not equal or exceed $[[USD Value 1]] (fifty million dollars) by the Phase 1 Completion Deadline, (b) Hess does not elect to proceed to Phase 2, or (c) Hess Money Spent does not equal $[[USD Value 4]] (seventy million dollars) (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.5(b)) by the Phase 2 Completion Deadline, provided, that, in the case of (b) or (c) above, (x) the Working Interest Assignments contemplated by Section 4, and, as the case may be, transfer back obligations referred to in Section 3, have been completed and (y) each Participation Agreement shall remain in full force and effect thereafter in accordance with its terms.

^^Unless earlier terminated by (a) mutual written agreement of both Parties, (b) under Section 6.1, (c) by Toreador under Section 6.3 or (d) by Hess under Section 6.2, this Agreement shall terminate ten (10) years after the date hereof, provided that each Participation Agreement shall remain in full force and effect thereafter in accordance with its terms to the extent applicable.

^^Sections 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

^**OPERATORSHIP**

^^Toreador shall remain the operator of record of such Permits for which it is operator until such time as Hess has become a Co-Titleholder of such Permit. Upon Hess becoming a Co-Titleholder of a Permit, Hess may, subject to Section 7.4 below, elect to become the operator of record of such Permit. If Hess so elects to become operator, it shall provide Toreador with written notice specifying the Permit(s) on which Hess wishes to become operator, and Toreador shall thereafter resign as operator of such Permits in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Participation Agreement. Upon receiving such notice, Toreador and Hess shall cooperate to submit to the French Administration such documentation as may be required by the French Administration in order to effect such transfer of operatorship. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment nor any other consideration shall be due to Toreador as a result of Toreador’s ceasing to be the operator of the Permits.

^^Until such time as Hess is the operator of record on each Wholly-Owned Permit and, as the case may be, each Wholly-Owned Pending Permit which would be granted by the French Administration, Toreador shall delegate to Hess the operator’s duties and powers relating to the monitoring and carrying out of drilling activities in the Permit’s acreage as well as other geological and geophysical activities related to such drilling and such other duties and powers as determined by the Management Committee.

^^If (a) Hess Money Spent does not equal or exceed $[[USD Value 1]] (fifty million dollars) by the Phase 1 Completion Deadline, (b) Hess does not elect to proceed to Phase 2, or (c) Hess Money Spent does not equal $[[USD Value 4]] (seventy million dollars) (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.5(b)) by the Phase 2 Completion Deadline, Hess shall no longer be, and shall lose its election to become, operator under any of the Permits. If Hess is then an operator on any Permit, it shall immediately resign as operator, and operatorship shall revert to Toreador in accordance of the provisions of the relevant Participation Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment nor any other consideration shall be due to Hess as a result of Hess’s ceasing to be the operator of the Permits.

^^The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have Hess appointed as operator of the Non-Wholly Owned Permits and Non-Wholly Owned Pending Permits.

^**SUCCESS FEES**

^^Reserves Success Fee.

^^Hess shall pay Toreador a success fee (the “**Reserves Success Fee**”) of $[[USD Value 11: Number]] per bbl of Reserves as agreed by the Parties in accordance with Section 8.1(c).

^^The Reserves Success Fee shall be calculated and payable annually. Beginning with the second year the Reserves Success Fee may be payable, the Reserves Success Fee shall be payable only in respect of Reserves additions booked in excess of the Reserves from the previous year. In no event shall the Reserves Success Fee be less than $[[USD Value 10: Number]] (zero dollars).

^^Within sixty (60) calendar days following Hess’s fiscal year-end, Hess shall provide Toreador with a written notice setting forth its proposed Reserves (consistent with its annual reserves report filed with the SEC if it is, at that time, required to file an annual report with the SEC) (the “**Proposed Reserves**”). Toreador shall have thirty (30) calendar days from receipt thereof to deliver notice to Hess of any objection to the Proposed Reserves; thereafter, Toreador may, at its sole cost, engage either Degolyer & MacNaughton or Ryder Scott Petroleum Consultants to complete an evaluation of the Reserves, such conclusion to be final and binding on the Parties for the purposes of calculating the Reserves Success Fee. If Toreador fails to timely provide notice of an objection to the Proposed Reserves, the Proposed Reserves shall be the Reserves for purposes of this Section 8.1.

^^The Reserves Success Fee shall be payable by Hess within thirty (30) calendar days of agreement by the Parties of the Reserves in accordance with Section 8.1(c) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Toreador in writing.

^^Subject to Section 8.3, the Reserves Success Fee shall be payable by Hess to Toreador for so long as, and until, Hess has paid $[[USD Value 5: Number]] (eighty million dollars) (the “**Reserves Success Fee Cap**”) to Toreador in respect of its obligations under this Section 8.1.

^^Production Success Fee.

^^If gross production from within the Gross Acreage from which Hess is receiving any revenue, exceeds a rate of 20,000 bbl per day for thirty (30) consecutive calendar days (the “**Production Trigger**”), then Hess shall pay Toreador a production success fee (the “**Production Success Fee**”) equal to [[Percentage 4: Number]]% (ten percent) of Hess Revenue.

^^The Production Success Fee shall be calculated and payable monthly, beginning with the first full calendar month following the Production Trigger. The Production Success Fee shall be payable by Hess to Toreador within sixty (60) calendar days of each month-end by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Toreador in writing, such payment to be accompanied by a detailed monthly statement setting forth Hess’s calculation of such month’s Production Success Fee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Toreador shall have the right to audit at its sole cost the accounts and records of Hess relating to the Production Success Fee for twenty four (24) months following receipt of a given monthly statement. Any dispute relating to the determination of the Production Success Fee shall be resolved in accordance with Section 14.3.

^^Subject to Section 8.3, the Production Success Fee shall be payable by Hess to Toreador until the earlier of thirty-six (36) months following the date the Production Trigger occurs or until Hess has paid to Toreador $[[USD Value 1]] (fifty million dollars) (the “**Production Success Fee Cap**”) in respect of its obligations under this Section 8.2.

^^Adjustment. If, at the Phase 1 Completion Deadline, the Acreage Delivered is less than [[Percentage 5: Number]]% of the Acreage Represented, then the Reserves Success Fee Cap and the Production Success Fee Cap shall each be reduced by the same percentage by which the Acreage Delivered falls below [[Percentage 5]]% of the Acreage Represented. For example, if Acreage Delivered equals 966,450 gross acres, then Acreage Delivered would be [[Percentage 6: Number]]% of the Acreage Represented. Thus, the Reserves Success Fee Cap would be reduced by [[Percentage 7: Number]]% ([[Percentage 5]]%-[[Percentage 6]]%=[[Percentage 7]]%) or by $[[USD Value 6: Number]] (four million dollars) to $[[USD Value 7: Number]] (seventy six million dollars), and the Production Success Fee Cap would be reduced by [[Percentage 7]]% ([[Percentage 5]]%-[[Percentage 6]]%=[[Percentage 7]]%) or $[[USD Value 8: Number]] (two million five hundred thousand dollars) to $[[USD Value 9: Number]] (forty seven million five hundred thousand dollars).

^^Transfer of Success Fee Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Hess shall not sell, assign, farm out, transfer or otherwise dispose of or create any encumbrance over all or any part of its Transfer Working Interests unless the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section 8, and Hess shall be responsible for any failure by such transferee to comply with the terms hereof.

^**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

^^From the date hereof and during Phase 1, Hess shall not sell, assign, farm out, transfer or otherwise dispose of or create any encumbrance over all or part of the Transfer Working Interests.

^^From the date hereof until the date on which Government Approval (or refusal, as the case may be) for the last of the Wholly Owned Permits is obtained, Toreador shall not assign, farm out, transfer or sell all or part of the Original Working Interest to a third party.

^^From the date hereof until the Phase 2 Completion Date, if a Party wishes to transfer a working interest in a Non-Wholly Owned Permit or a Non-Wholly Owned Pending Permit to any other party to a Participation Agreement for such Permit, it shall send to the other Party a written notice in connection with such contemplated transfer and the Parties shall enter into good faith discussions in relation to agreeing terms and conditions for such contemplated transfer. If the Parties fail to agree within sixty (60) calendar days from the receipt of such notice, the Party wishing to make such transfer to such other party shall be permitted to do so.

^^From the date hereof until the Phase 2 Completion Date, Toreador shall not transfer or assign more than [[Percentage 8: Number]]% (forty percent) of the Original Working Interest in a Permit.

^^During Phase 2, Hess shall only be permitted to assign an interest in each Permit up to the Resulting Working Interest.

^^Notwithstanding the above, a Party shall be entitled to assign or transfer all or part of its interest in a Permit to an Affiliate, provided, that, such Party shall also assign its corresponding rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

^^Subject to the other provisions in this Section 9, the relevant Participation Agreement shall govern the terms of any proposed assignment, farm-out, transfer or sale of a working interest in any Permit by either Party, including any preemptive right.

^**REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES**

^^Toreador Representations and Warranties. Toreador makes the following representations and warranties as of the date hereof:

^^Toreador holds the rights to the Original Working Interests in the Wholly Owned Permits and Non-Wholly Owned Permits, free and clear of any liens, claims, burdens or encumbrances, other than (i) any preemptive or other rights set forth in the relevant participation agreement, a copy of which has been provided to Hess and (ii) the liens, claims, burdens or encumbrances in favor of the French Administration according to the terms of the Permits and applicable laws. Each Wholly Owned Permit and Non-Wholly Owned Permit is in full force and effect and no notice of default, termination, or breach under such Wholly Owned Permit or Non-Wholly Owned Permit has been received by Toreador nor, to the best of its knowledge, any other party to a Non-Wholly Owned Permit. Each Wholly Owned Permit or Non-Wholly Owned Permit, together with applicable laws, contains the entirety of the obligation of Toreador to the French Administration, and no other understanding or agreement exists between Toreador and the French Administration, in relation to the subject matter of such Wholly Owned Permit or Non-Wholly Owned Permit.

^^Toreador has provided Hess with a complete and correct copy of each Permit and the relevant participation agreement for each Non-Wholly Owned Permit. Where Toreador has provided any translation of a Permit, participation agreement or any related document, Toreador has done so as a courtesy to Hess, and Toreador makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the translation.

^^Toreador is not party to any material litigation, arbitration or administrative proceeding that would prevent the consummation of Working Interest Assignments contemplated by this Agreement.

^^To the best of its knowledge, the Wholly Owned Permits have been owned and operated by Toreador in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws, including environmental laws, with respect to the operation of, and the abandonment of wells (if any) on, the Wholly Owned Permits. To the best of its knowledge, no environmental claim has been commenced that is reasonably likely to be adversely determined against Toreador and which, if so determined, is likely to materially prejudice or endanger, in any manner, the Transfer Working Interests.

^^Hess Representations and Warranties. Hess makes the following representations and warranties to Toreador as of the date hereof:

^^Hess or its Affiliates have sufficient technical capability, personnel and resources to fulfill Hess’s obligations under this Agreement in compliance with all applicable laws as well as applicable industry safety, health and environmental standards.

^^Hess or its Affiliates have sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to fulfill all of its obligations under this Agreement.

^^Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each Party makes the following representations and warranties to each other Party as of the date hereof:

^^Each Party is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction where it is organized. Each Party has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Party and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Party, enforceable against each Party in accordance with its terms.

^^The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by each Party, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the compliance with the provisions hereof will not, to the best of its knowledge:

^^^violate any applicable laws or regulations, judgment, decree or award;

^^^contravene the organizational documents of a Party; or

^^^result in a violation of a term or provision, or constitute a default or accelerate the performance of any obligation under any contract or agreement executed by a Party hereto, except, with respect to this Section 10.3(b)(iii), as would not have a material adverse effect.

^^Neither Party nor, to the best of its knowledge, its Affiliates or any person acting on its or their behalf has, in connection with the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, taken any action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a violation by such persons of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or the principles described in the OECD Convention.

^^Indemnification. The representations and warranties of the Parties in this Agreement shall survive for two (2) years from the date hereof. Each of the Parties agrees to indemnify and hold the other Party harmless for any claims, causes of action or liabilities, which arise out of the breach of any of the warranties and representations herein by the indemnifying Party.

^^Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the representations and warranties explicitly made in this Agreement, Toreador makes no, and disclaims any, warranty or representation of any kind, either express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, without limitation, the accuracy or completeness of any data, reports, records, projections, information, or materials or with respect to any Permit, reserves or production rates now, heretofore, or hereafter furnished or made available to Hess in connection with this Agreement.

^^In this Section 10 the phrase “to the best of its knowledge” shall mean that the statement is deemed to have been made after all reasonable enquiry in the context of this Agreement of those employees who have direct responsibility for the matter in question and might reasonably be expected to be in possession of information relevant to the same.

^**TAX**

^^Tax Obligations.

^^The *société en participation* to be created in respect to each Permit shall be tax transparent for French tax purposes and (i) the identity of its partners shall be disclosed to the French tax authorities no later than by the end of the first fiscal quarter following the end of the fiscal year in which Hess becomes a partner in such *société en participation* and (ii) such partners shall be unlimited partners.

^^Each Party shall be responsible for reporting and discharging its own tax measured by the profit or income of the Party and the satisfaction of such Party’s share of all obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall protect, defend and indemnify each other Party from any and all loss, cost or liability arising from the indemnifying Party’s failure to report and discharge such taxes or satisfy such obligations. The Parties intend that all income and all tax benefits (including deductions, depreciation, credits and capitalization) with respect to the expenditures made by the Parties hereunder will be allocated by the French tax authorities to the Parties based on the share of each tax item actually received or borne by each Party. If such allocation is not accomplished due to the application of the laws or regulations or other government action, the Party that has actually benefited through a reduction in income or received additional tax benefits over the amount based on the share of each tax item actually received or borne by that respective Party, shall make a payment to the other Party to ensure that the other Party is in the same after tax position as if the income and all tax benefits with respect to the expenditure made by the Parties hereunder had been allocated by the French tax authorities to the Parties based on the share of each item actually received or borne by each Party. No payment shall be due by a Party under this Section 11.1(b) if the tax benefit of such Party does not result in a decrease of the corporate tax actually paid by such Party.

^^Hess shall be solely responsible for bearing any transfer taxes in connection with the acquisition of the Transfer Working Interests.

^^Where any VAT is or become chargeable in respect of any amounts due under this Agreement, such amounts shall be increased by a sum equal to the VAT so chargeable at the standard rate, currently [[Percentage 2]]%. For this purpose, any Party receiving a payment under this Agreement shall deliver a valid invoice to the Party making such payment, showing the amount of VAT payable under the applicable legislation.

^^If the Tax authority determines in writing that VAT is not due in respect of any payment made between the parties under this Agreement, then the Party having issued the relevant VAT invoice shall issue to the other Party a revised invoice and shall (i) use its best endeavors vis-à-vis the Tax authority to obtain a refund of the VAT initially paid to the Tax authority and (ii) reimburse such VAT to the other Party, provided that such VAT has been recovered from the Tax Authority

^**CONFIDENTIALITY**

^^Except as otherwise provided in the Participation Agreements (which confidentiality provisions will prevail in the event of any conflict between Section 12 of this Agreement and the confidentiality provisions of any of the Participation Agreements), each Party agrees that all information disclosed under this Agreement or in connection with the Parties’ obligations hereunder, except information in the public domain or lawfully in possession of a Party prior to the date hereof, shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other person or entity without the prior written consent of the Party which owns such confidential information. This obligation of confidentiality shall remain in force during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two years thereafter.

^^to a bona fide prospective transferee of a Party’s working interest, or portion thereof, to the extent appropriate in order to allow the assessment of such working interest (including an entity with whom a Party and/or its Affiliates are conducting bona fide negotiations directed toward a merger, consolidation or the sale of a majority of its or an Affiliate’s shares);

^^to a bank or other financial institution to the extent appropriate to a Party arranging for funding;

^^to the extent such information must be disclosed pursuant to any rules or requirements of any government, government agency or commission or stock exchange having jurisdiction over such Party or its Affiliates;

^^to its respective employees, subject to each Party taking sufficient precautions to ensure such information is kept confidential;

^^to the extent any information which, through no fault of a Party, becomes a part of the public domain; and

^^to a party to a Participation Agreement for a Permit (other than a Party) or to the French Administration solely to the extent as may be required to satisfy the conditions detailed in Section 4.

^^Disclosure as pursuant to Sections 12.1(e), 12.1(f) and 12.1(g) shall not be made unless prior to such disclosure the disclosing Party has obtained a written undertaking from the recipient party to keep the information strictly confidential for at least as long as the period set out above and to use the information for the sole purpose described in Sections 12.1(e), 12.1(f) and 12.1(g) whichever is applicable, with respect to the disclosing Party.

^^If arbitration proceedings are initiated, such proceedings shall not suspend or modify in any way the Parties’ obligations under this Agreement, until the arbitration decision has been rendered.

^^A Party may apply to any competent judicial authority for interim or conservatory relief.
