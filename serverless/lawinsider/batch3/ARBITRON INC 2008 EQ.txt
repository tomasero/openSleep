^^The Optionee agrees that he or she will not take any Adverse Actions (as defined below) against the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during the period that the Option is or may yet become exercisable in whole or in part or at any time before one year following the Optionee’s cessation of employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, whichever is later (the “***Restricted Period***”). The Optionee acknowledges that damages that may arise from a breach of this Section 5.4 may be impossible to ascertain or prove with certainty. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Company determines in its sole discretion that the Optionee has taken Adverse Actions against the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during the Restricted Period, in addition to other legal remedies that may be available, (i) the Company will be entitled to an immediate injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction to end such Adverse Action, without further proof of damage, (ii) the Committee will have the authority in its sole discretion to terminate immediately all rights of the Optionee under the Plan and this Agreement without notice of any kind, and (iii) the Committee will have the authority in its sole discretion to rescind the exercise of all or any portion of the Option to the extent that such exercise occurred within six months prior to the date the Optionee first commences any such Adverse Actions and require the Optionee to disgorge any profits (however defined by the Committee) realized by the Optionee relating to such exercised portion of the Option or any Option Shares issued or issuable upon such exercise. Such disgorged profits paid to the Company must be made in cash (including check, bank draft or money order) or, with the Committee’s consent, shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of such payment. The Company will be entitled to withhold and deduct from future wages of the Optionee (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to the Optionee from the Company or a Subsidiary) or make other arrangements for the collection of all amounts necessary to satisfy such payment obligation. 

^^For purposes of this Agreement, an “***Adverse Action***” will mean any of the following: (i) engaging in any commercial activity in competition with any part of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary as conducted during the Restricted Period for which the Optionee has or had access to trade secrets and/or confidential information; (ii) diverting or attempting to divert from the Company or any Subsidiary any business of any kind, including, without limitation, interference with any business relationships with suppliers, customers, licensees, licensors, clients or contractors; (iii) participating in the ownership, operation or control of, or being employed by, or connected in any manner with any person or entity that solicits, offers or provides any services or products similar to those which the Company or any Subsidiary offers to its customers or prospective customers, (iv) making, or causing or attempting to cause any other person or entity to make, any statement, either written or oral, or convey any information about the Company or any Subsidiary that is disparaging or that in any way reflects negatively on the Company or any Subsidiary; or (v) engaging in any other activity that is hostile, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company or any Subsidiary, including, without limitation, influencing or advising any person who is employed by or in the service of the Company or any Subsidiary to leave such employment or service to compete with the Company or any Subsidiary or to enter into the employment or service of any actual or prospective competitor of the Company or any Subsidiary, influencing or advising any competitor of the Company or any Subsidiary to employ to otherwise engage the services of any person who is employed by or in the service of the Company or any Subsidiary, or improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing any trade secrets or confidential information regarding the Company or any Subsidiary. 

^^^^^ 
^^Should any provision of this Section 5.4 of the Agreement be held invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Section 5.4 of the Agreement, but, rather, the Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Optionee expressly agrees that should the duration of or business activities covered by, any provision of this Agreement be in excess of that which is valid or enforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed to cover only that duration, extent or activities that may validly or enforceably be covered. The Optionee acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly stipulates that this Agreement shall be construed in a manner that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law. This Section 5.4 of the Agreement does not replace and is in addition to any other agreements the Optionee may have with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the matters addressed herein. 

^Securities Law and Other Restrictions. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, the Company will not be required to issue, and the Optionee may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any Option Shares, unless (a) there is in effect with respect to the Option Shares a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state or foreign securities laws or an exemption from such registration, and (b) there has been obtained any other consent, approval or permit from any other regulatory body which the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. The Company may condition such issuance, sale or transfer upon the receipt of any representations or agreements from the parties involved, and the placement of any legends on certificates representing Option Shares, as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the Company in order to comply with such securities law or other restrictions. 

^Withholding Taxes.  

The Company is entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of the Optionee (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to the Optionee from the Company), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy any federal or provincial withholding tax requirements attributable to the Option, or (b) require the Optionee promptly to remit the amount of such withholding to the Company before acting on the Optionee’s notice of exercise of the Option. In the event that the Company is unable to withhold such amounts, for whatever reason, the Optionee agrees to pay to the Company an amount equal to the amount the Company would otherwise be required to withhold under federal, state or local law.
