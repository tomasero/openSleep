^^The Founder also may permit Participants to elect to defer the issuance of Shares or the settlement of Awards in cash under the Plan pursuant to such rules, procedures or programs as it may establish for purposes of this Plan.

^^The Founder may condition the grant of any Award or combination of Awards authorized under this Plan on the surrender or deferral by the Participant of his or her right to receive a cash bonus or other compensation otherwise payable by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Participant.

^^Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to a right of first refusal, one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Founder in its discretion at the time the Award is granted. The Founder shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Founder. Upon request by the Founder, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of Shares hereunder and shall promptly present to the Founder any and all certificates representing Shares acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.

^^This Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary (including, without limitation, continuation of employment), nor shall it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate such Participant’s employment or other service at any time, with or without Cause.

^^The terms of employment of an employee shall not be affected by the execution of this Plan. Awards granted under this Plan shall not form a part of the terms of employment of an employee or entitle such employee to take into account Awards granted under this Plan when calculating any compensation or damages upon Termination of such employee’s employment for any reason.

^^This Plan shall be effective immediately upon its adoption by the Founder. All Awards under this Plan shall be null and void if the Plan is not approved by the shareholders within such 12-month period.

^**Governing Law.** The Plan and all grants and Awards and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the Cayman Islands.

^**Compliance with Law.** The grant of Awards and the issuance of Shares in connection with such Awards under this Plan shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of the laws of the PRC, the laws of the Cayman Islands, and all other Applicable Laws with respect to the issuance of securities. Restricted Share Units may not be paid out if the issuance of Shares would constitute a violation of any Applicable Laws or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Shares may then be listed. The inability of the Company or Founder to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s or the Founder’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder shall relieve the Founder of any liability in respect of the failure to transfer such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to payment of Restricted Share Units, the Founder may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any Applicable Law and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Founder.

^**Termination.** No grant will be made under this Plan more than 10 years after the date on which this Plan is first approved by the Founder, but all grants made on or prior to such date will continue in effect thereafter subject to the terms thereof and of this Plan.
