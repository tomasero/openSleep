Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the failure of any of Seller's products, or any assemblies or sub-assemblies, to conform to the mutually agreed upon specifications is the result of a defective or non-conforming component supplied by any third party manufacturer, the foregoing warranty of Seller shall not be applicable thereto and Seller shall have no obligation with respect to the repair or replacement of such non-conforming Products or assemblies or sub­assemblies; and Buyer covenants and agrees to look solely to such third party manufacturer in accordance with the terms and conditions of any warranty provided by such third party manufacturer.

^^Buyer shall be responsible for providing the specifications for the manufacture of the Products and Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that Seller's manufacture and sale of the Products based upon such specifications shall not infringe any patent, copyright or proprietary right of any third party.

In no event shall either party be liable to the other for special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

^^In order to minimize the risk of a failure of a Product in the field, Buyer may, from time to time, inspect the assembly of the Product at Seller's facility and will be given notice of when the Product is expected to be completed. Seller will make Seller's facilities available to Buyer to allow Buyer to conduct quality assurance and final testing procedures to insure compliance of the Product with all applicable specifications.

^^The Seller shall supply, at its own expense, all equipment required for the purpose of manufacturing the Products. The Seller shall maintain, at its own expense, the facility, including, without limitation, the equipment, in a state of repair and operating efficiency consistent with the requirements of the Specifications for the Products, good manufacturing practices in a manner consistent with ISO 9002 or other guidelines typically required by Buyer's customers, and other applicable legal requirements.
