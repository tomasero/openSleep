\centered **RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT** 

^Issuance of Units. [[Organization 1 Name]], a California corporation (the “Company”), hereby issues to the Grantee (the “Grantee”) named in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “Notice”) an award (the “Award”) of the Total Number of Restricted Stock Units Awarded set forth in the Notice (the “Units”), subject to the Notice, this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the “Agreement”) and the terms and provisions of the [[Organization 1 Name]] 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”), which is incorporated herein by reference. Unless otherwise provided herein, the terms in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as those defined in the Plan. 

^Transfer Restrictions. The Units may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 

^Conversion of Units and Issuance of Shares. 

^^General. Subject to Sections 3(b) and 3(c), one share of Common Stock and a Cash Dividend Equivalent (as defined in this Section 3(a)), if applicable, shall be issuable for each Unit subject to the Award (the “Shares”) upon vesting. Immediately thereafter, or as soon as administratively feasible, the Company will transfer the appropriate number of Shares and the Cash Dividend Equivalent amount to the Grantee after satisfaction of any required tax or other withholding obligations. For purposes herein, “Cash Dividend Equivalent” means for each Share issuable in settlement of a vested Unit, a cash payment equal to the aggregate cash dividends, if any, that would have been payable to the Grantee with respect to such Share had the Grantee been the holder of the Share between the Date of Award and the date of such settlement; provided, however, that no such amount shall be payable with respect to any Unit that does not vest. Any fractional Unit remaining after the Award is fully vested shall be discarded and shall not be converted into a fractional Share, and no Cash Dividend Equivalent shall be payable with respect to such fractional Unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the relevant number of Shares shall be issued, and the related Cash Dividend Equivalent shall be paid, no later than [[Date 1: Date]] of the year following the calendar year in which the Award vests. The Company may however, in its sole discretion, make a cash payment in lieu of the issuance of the Shares in an amount equal to the value of one share of Common Stock multiplied by the number of Units subject to the Award; provided that the Cash Dividend Equivalent in such event shall be calculated as though the Grantee had been issued Shares rather than such cash payment. Effective upon the consummation of a Corporate Transaction, the Award shall terminate unless it is Assumed in connection with the Corporate Transaction. 

^^Delay of Conversion. The conversion of the Units into the Shares, but not the payment of the related Cash Dividend Equivalent, if any, under Section 3(a) above shall be 

delayed in the event the Company reasonably anticipates that the issuance of the Shares would constitute a violation of federal securities laws or other Applicable Law. If the conversion of the Units into the Shares is delayed by the provisions of this Section 3(b), the conversion of the Units into the Shares shall occur at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates issuing the Shares will not cause a violation of federal securities laws or other Applicable Law. For purposes of this Section 3(b), the issuance of Shares that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not considered a violation of Applicable Law. 

^^Delay of Issuance of Shares. The Company shall delay the issuance of any Shares and the payment of any related Cash Dividend Equivalent under this Section 3 to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain “specified employees” of certain publicly-traded companies); in such event, any Shares and any Cash Dividend Equivalent to which the Grantee would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the date of the Grantee’s termination of Continuous Service will be issuable on the first business day following the expiration of such six (6) month period. 

^Right to Shares. The Grantee shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights or, except as provided in Section 3(a), rights with respect to dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to the Grantee. 

^Restrictive Covenants. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantee’s eligibility for, receipt of, and vesting of the Award is conditioned upon Grantee’s compliance at all times with (a) the Company’s Proprietary Information Agreement entered into between the Grantee and the Company and (b) the Company’s governance policies, including, without limitation, the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 

^Taxes. 

^^Tax Liability. The Grantee is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by the Grantee in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company or any Related Entity takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. Neither the Company nor any Related Entity makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with any aspect of the Award, including the grant, vesting, assignment, release or cancellation of the Units, the delivery of Shares, the payment of any Cash Dividend Equivalent, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting and the receipt of any other dividends or dividend equivalents. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate the Grantee’s tax liability. 

^^Payment of Withholding Taxes. Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state, local or non-U.S., including any social insurance, employment tax, payment on account or other tax-related obligation (the “Tax Withholding Obligation”), the Grantee must arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax 

Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. Unless the Board or the compensation committee of the Board affirmatively determines to require the Grantee to make other arrangements to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company shall satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by Share withholding as set forth in Section 6(c) below; provided, however, that the Company shall satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation attributable to a Cash Dividend Equivalent by withholding a portion of such Cash Dividend Equivalent sufficient to satisfy such portion of the Tax Withholding Obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or a Related Entity also may satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation by offsetting any amounts (including, but not limited to, salary, bonus and severance payments) payable to the Grantee by the Company and/or a Related Entity. Furthermore, in the event of any determination that the Company has failed to withhold a sum sufficient to pay all withholding taxes due in connection with the Award, the Grantee agrees to pay the Company the amount of such deficiency in cash within five (5) days after receiving a written demand from the Company to do so, whether or not the Grantee is an employee of the Company at that time. 

^^Share Withholding. If permissible under Applicable Law, the Grantee authorizes the Company to, upon the exercise of its sole discretion, withhold from those Shares otherwise issuable to the Grantee the whole number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the minimum applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. The Grantee acknowledges that the withheld Shares may not be sufficient to satisfy the Grantee’s minimum Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, the Grantee agrees to pay to the Company or any Related Entity as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the withholding of Shares described above. 

^Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Notice, the Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and the Grantee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Grantee’s interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and the Grantee. These agreements are to be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of California to the rights and duties of the parties. Should any provision of the Notice or this Agreement be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable. 

^Construction. The captions used in the Notice and this Agreement are inserted for convenience and shall not be deemed a part of the Award for construction or interpretation. Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. Use of the term “or” is not intended to be exclusive, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 

^Administration and Interpretation. Any question or dispute regarding the administration or interpretation of the Notice, the Plan or this Agreement shall be submitted by the Grantee or by the Company to the Administrator. The resolution of such question or dispute by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all persons. 

^Venue and Jurisdiction. The parties agree that any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Notice, the Plan or this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (or should such court lack jurisdiction to hear such action, suit or proceeding, in a California state court in the County of Alameda) and that the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of such court. The parties irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection the party may have to the laying of venue for any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court. If any one or more provisions of this Section 10 shall for any reason be held invalid or unenforceable, it is the specific intent of the parties that such provisions shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it or its application valid and enforceable. 

^Notices. Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon personal delivery, upon deposit for delivery by an internationally recognized express mail courier service or upon deposit in the United States mail by certified mail (if the parties are within the United States), with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party at its address as shown in these instruments, or to such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the other party. 

^Data Privacy. 

^^The Grantee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Grantee’s personal data as described in the Notice and this Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Grantee’s employer, the Company and any Related Entity for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Grantee’s participation in the Plan. 

^^The Grantee understands that the Company and the Grantee’s employer may hold certain personal information about the Grantee, including, but not limited to, the Grantee’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Grantee’s favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (“Data”). 

^^The Grantee understands that Data will be transferred to any third party assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The Grantee understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the Grantee’s country, or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Grantee’s country. The Grantee understands that the Grantee may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Grantee’s local human resources representative. The Grantee authorizes the Company and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Grantee’s participation in the Plan. The Grantee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Grantee’s participation in the Plan. The Grantee understands that the Grantee may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Grantee’s local human resources representative. The Grantee understands, however, that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect the Grantee’s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of the Grantee’s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Grantee understands that the Grantee may contact the Grantee’s local human resources representative. 

^Language. If the Grantee has received this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control, unless otherwise prescribed by Applicable Law. 

^Amendment and Delay to Meet the Requirements of Section 409A. The Grantee acknowledges that the Company, in the exercise of its sole discretion and without the consent of the Grantee, may amend or modify this Agreement in any manner and delay the issuance of any Shares issuable or amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code as amplified by any Treasury regulations or guidance from the Internal Revenue Service as the Company deems appropriate or advisable. In addition, the Company makes no representation that the Award will comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to prevent Section 409A of the Code from applying to the Award or to mitigate its effects on any deferrals or payments made in respect of the Units. The Grantee is encouraged to consult a tax adviser regarding the potential impact of Section 409A of the Code.
