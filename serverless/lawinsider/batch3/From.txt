Settlement Shares:   With respect to any Settlement Date, a number of Shares, not to exceed the Base Amount, designated as such by Party B in the related Settlement Notice or by Party A pursuant to “Termination Settlement” below; provided that on the Maturity Date the number of Settlement Shares shall be equal to the Base Amount on such date.

Settlement:   Physical Settlement, Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement, at the election of Party B as set forth in a Settlement Notice that satisfies the Settlement Notice Requirements; provided that Physical Settlement shall apply (i) if no Settlement Method is validly selected, (ii) with respect to any Settlement Shares in respect of which Party A is unable, in its judgment, to unwind its hedge by the end of the Unwind Period in a manner that, in the judgment of Party A, is consistent with the requirements for qualifying for the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act or due to the lack of sufficient liquidity in the Shares on any Exchange Business Day during the Unwind Period, (iii) to any Termination Settlement Date (as defined below under “Termination Settlement”) or (iv) if the Maturity Date is a Settlement Date, in respect of such Settlement Date.

Settlement Notice

Requirements:   Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, a Settlement Notice delivered by Party B that specifies Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement will not be effective to establish a Settlement Date or require Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement unless Party B delivers to Party A with such Settlement Notice a representation signed by Party B substantially in the following form: “As of the date of this Settlement Notice, Party B is not aware of any material nonpublic information concerning itself or the Shares, and is designating the date contained herein as a Settlement Date in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with the federal securities laws.”

Unwind Period:   Each Exchange Business Day that is not a Suspension Day during the period from and including the first Exchange Business Day following the date Party B validly elects Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement in respect of a Settlement Date through the third Scheduled Trading Day preceding such Settlement Date (or the immediately preceding Exchange Business Day if such Scheduled Trading Day is not an Exchange Business Day); subject to “Termination Settlement” below. If any Exchange Business Day during an Unwind Period is a Disrupted Day, the Calculation Agent shall make commercially reasonable adjustments to the terms of this Transaction (including, without limitation, the Cash Settlement Amount and the 10b-18 VWAP) to account for the occurrence of such Disrupted Day.

Market Disruption Event:   Section 6.3(a)(ii) of the 2002 Definitions is hereby amended by replacing clause (ii) in its entirety with “(ii) an Exchange Disruption, or” and inserting immediately following clause (iii) the phrase “; in each case that the Calculation Agent determines is material.”

Exchange Act:   The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time.

Physical Settlement:   On any Settlement Date in respect of which Physical Settlement applies, Party B shall deliver to Party A through the   Clearance System the Settlement Shares for such Settlement Date, and Party A shall deliver to Party B, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Party B, an amount in cash equal to the Physical Settlement Amount for such Settlement Date, on a delivery versus payment basis. If, on any Settlement Date, the Shares to be delivered by Party B to Party A hereunder are not so delivered (the “Deferred Shares”), and a Forward Price Reduction Date occurs during the period from, and including, such Settlement Date to, but excluding, the date such Shares are actually delivered to Party A, then the portion of the Physical Settlement Amount payable by Party A to Party B in respect of the Deferred Shares shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Forward Price Reduction Amount for such Forward Price Reduction Date, multip lied by the number of Deferred Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, no Forward Price Reduction Amount for a Forward Price Reduction Date shall be applied to reduce the Forward Price more than once.

Physical Settlement Amount:   For any Settlement Date in respect of which Physical Settlement applies, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Forward Price on such Settlement Date and (ii) the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement Date.

Cash Settlement:   On any Settlement Date in respect of which Cash Settlement applies, if the Cash Settlement Amount for such Settlement Date is a positive number, Party A will pay such Cash Settlement Amount to Party B. If the Cash Settlement Amount is a negative number, Party B will pay the absolute value of such Cash Settlement Amount to Party A. Such amounts shall be paid on the Settlement Date.

Cash Settlement Amount:   For any Settlement Date in respect of which Cash Settlement applies, an amount determined by the Calculation Agent equal to the difference between (1) the product of (i) (A) the average Forward Price during the applicable Unwind Period minus (B) the average of the 10b-18 VWAP prices per Share on each Exchange Business Day during such Unwind Period, and (ii) the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement Date, and (2) the product of (i) the Forward Price Reduction Amount for any Forward Price Reduction Date that occurs during such Unwind Period, and (ii) the number of Settlement Shares with respect to which Party A has not unwound its hedge as of such Forward Price Reduction Date.

Net Share Settlement:   On any Settlement Date in respect of which Net Share Settlement applies, if the number of Net Share Settlement Shares is a (i) negative number, Party A shall deliver a number of Shares to Party B equal to the absolute value of the Net Share Settlement Shares, or (ii) positive number, Party B shall deliver to Party A the Net Share Settlement Shares; provided that if Party A determines in its good faith judgment that it would be required to deliver Net Share Settlement Shares to   Party B, Party A may elect to deliver a portion of such Net Share Settlement Shares on one or more dates prior to the applicable Settlement Date.

Net Share Settlement Shares:   For any Settlement Date in respect of which Net Share Settlement applies, a number of Shares equal to (a) the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement Date minus (b) the number of Shares Party A actually purchases during the Unwind Period for a total purchase price equal to the difference between (1) the product of (i) the average Forward Price during the applicable Unwind Period and (ii) the number of Settlement Shares for such Settlement Date, and (2) the product of (i) the Forward Price Reduction Amount for any Forward Price Reduction Date that occurs during such Unwind Period and (ii) the number of Shares with respect to which Party A has not unwound its hedge as of such Forwar d Price Reduction Date.

10b-18 VWAP:   For any Exchange Business Day during the Unwind Period which is not a Suspension Day, the volume-weighted average price at which the Shares trade as reported in the composite transactions for the Exchange on such Exchange Business Day, excluding (i) trades that do not settle regular way, (ii) opening (regular way) reported trades on the Exchange on such Exchange Business Day, (iii) trades that occur in the last ten minutes before the scheduled close of trading on the Exchange on such Exchange Business Day and ten minutes before the scheduled close of the primary trading session in the market where the trade is effected, and (iv) trades on such Exchange Business Day that do not satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b-18(b)(3), as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent. Party B acknowledges that Party A may refer to the Bloomberg Page “SCG <Equity> AQR SEC” (or any successor th ereto), in its discretion, for such Exchange Business Day to determine the 10b-18 VWAP.

Settlement Currency:   USD.

Failure to Deliver:   Inapplicable.

**Adjustments**:  
Method of Adjustment:   Calculation Agent Adjustment; notwithstanding anything in the 2002 Definitions to the contrary, the Calculation Agent may make an adjustment pursuant to Calculation Agent Adjustment to any one or more of the Base Amount, the Forward Price and any other variable relevant to the settlement or payment terms of this Transaction.

Additional Adjustment:   If, in Party A’s commercially reasonable judgment, the actual cost to Party A, over any one month period, of borrowing a number of Shares equal to the Base Amount to hedge its exposure to this Transaction exceeds a weighted average rate equal to 90 basis points per annum, the Calculation Agent shall reduce the Forward Price in order to compensate Party A for the amount by which such cost exceeded a weighted average rate equal to 90 basis points per annum during such period. The Calculation Agent shall notify Party B prior to making any such adjustment to the Forward Price and, upon the request of Party B, Party A shall provide an itemized list of its stock loan costs for the applicable one month period.

Payments to Party A:   To be advised under separate cover or telephone confirmed prior to each Settlement Date.

**Additional Representations, Warranties and Agreements of Party B**: Party B hereby represents and warrants to, and agrees with, Party A as of the date hereof that:

^^Any Shares, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Transaction, will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and the issuance thereof will not be subject to any preemptive or similar rights.

^^Party B has reserved and will keep available at all times, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Shares, solely for the purpose of issuance upon settlement of this Transaction as herein provided, the full number of Shares as shall be issuable at such time upon settlement of this Transaction. All Shares so issuable shall, upon such issuance, be accepted for listing or quotation on the Exchange.

^^Party B agrees to provide Party A at least 30 days’ written notice (an “Issuer Repurchase Notice”) prior to executing any repurchase of Shares by Party B or any of its subsidiaries (or entering into any contract that would require, or give the option to, Party B or any of its subsidiaries, to purchase or repurchase Shares), whether out of profits or capital or whether the consideration for such repurchase is cash, securities or otherwise (an “Issuer Repurchase”), that alone or in the aggregate would result in the Base Amount Percentage (as defined below) being (i) equal to or greater than [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the outstanding Shares or (ii) greater by [[Percentage 3: Number]]% or more than the Base Amount Percentage at the time of the immediately preceding Issuer Repurchase Notice (or in the case of the first such Issuer Repurchase Notice, great er than the Base Amount Percentage as of the later of the date hereof or the immediately preceding Settlement Date, if any).

^^Party B will not engage in any “distribution” (as defined in Regulation M under the Exchange Act (“Regulation M”)) that would cause a “restricted period” (as defined in Regulation M) to occur during any Unwind Period.

^^In addition to any other requirements set forth herein, Party B agrees not to elect Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement if, in the reasonable judgment of either Party A or Party B, such settlement or Party A’s related market activity would result in a violation of the U.S. federal securities laws or any other federal or state law or regulation applicable to Party B.

**Covenant of Party B**:  
The parties acknowledge and agree that any Shares delivered by Party B to Party A on any Settlement Date will be newly issued Shares and when delivered by Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) to securities lenders from whom Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) borrowed Shares in connection with hedging its exposure to this Transaction will be freely saleable without further registration or other restrictions under the Securities Act, in the hands of those securities lenders, irrespective of whether such stock loan is effected by Party A or an affiliate of Party A (provided that such Shares may be subject to resale restrictions if the status of any such securities lender would cause any such resale restrictions to apply by virtue of its share ownership in Party B, status as an “affiliate” of Party B or otherwise). Accordingly, Party B agrees that the Shares that it delivers to Party A on ea ch Settlement Date will not bear a restrictive legend and that such Shares will be deposited in, and the delivery thereof shall be effected through the facilities of, the Clearance System.

**Covenants of Party A**:

^^In connection with bids and purchases of Shares in connection with any Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement of this Transaction, Party A shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its activities, or cause its affiliates to conduct their activities, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, as if such provisions were applicable to such purchases.

**Insolvency Filing**:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the Agreement or in the Definitions, upon any Insolvency Filing in respect of the Issuer, this Transaction shall automatically terminate on the date thereof without further liability of either party to this Confirmation to the other party (except for any liability in respect of any breach of representation or covenant by a party under this Confirmation prior to the date of such Insolvency Filing).

The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that (1) at any point prior to any Insolvency Filing in respect of the Issuer, Party B shall have the unilateral right to elect Physical Settlement of this Transaction pursuant to the provisions set forth above under the heading “Settlement Terms”; and (2) this Transaction shall automatically terminate on the date of any Insolvency Filing pursuant the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph solely to the extent that Party B failed to elect Physical Settlement of this Transaction pursuant to the provisions set forth above under the heading “Settlement Terms” prior to the relevant Insolvency Filing.

If an ex-dividend date for an Extraordinary Dividend occurs on or after the Trade Date and on or prior to the Maturity Date (or, if later, the last date on which Shares are delivered by Party B to Party A in settlement of this Transaction), Party B shall pay an amount, as determined by the Calculation Agent, in cash equal to the product of such Extraordinary Dividend and the Base Amount to Party A on the earlier of (i) the date on which such Extraordinary Dividend is paid by the Issuer to holders of record of the Shares or (ii) the Maturity Date. “Extraordinary Dividend” means the per Share amount of any cash dividend or distribution declared by the Issuer with respect to the Shares that is specified by the board of directors of the Issuer as an “extraordinary” dividend.

**Acceleration Events**:  
The following events shall each constitute an “Acceleration Event”:

^^**Stock Borrow Events**. In the commercially reasonable judgment of Party A, (A) Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) is unable to hedge Party A’s exposure to this Transaction because of the lack of sufficient Shares being made available for Share borrowing by lenders, or (B) Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) would incur a cost to borrow Shares to hedge its exposure to this Transaction that is greater than a rate equal to 200 basis points per annum (a “Stock Borrow Event”);

^^**Dividends and Other Distributions**. On any day occurring after the Trade Date and prior to the Maturity Date Party B declares a distribution, issue or dividend to existing holders of the Shares of (i) any cash dividend (other than an Extraordinary Dividend) to the extent all cash dividends having an ex-dividend date during the period from and including any Forward Price Reduction Date (with the Trade Date being a Forward Price Reduction Date for purposes of this clause (b) only) to but excluding the next subsequent Forward Price Reduction Date exceeds, on a per Share basis, the Forward Price Reduction Amount set forth opposite the first date of such period or periods on Schedule I (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the actual declaration date, as opposed to the ex-dividend date, of any cash dividend shall not be used for purposes of determ ining the appropriate period to which a Forward Price Reduction Amount relates) or (ii) share capital or securities of another issuer acquired or owned (directly or indirectly) by Party B as a result of a spin-off or other similar transaction or (iii) any other type of securities (other than Shares), rights or warrants or other assets, for payment (cash or other consideration) at less than the prevailing market price as determined by Party A. To the extent the declaration of a distribution, issue or dividend contemplated by this paragraph (b) would also be considered to be the type of event to which Calculation Agent Adjustment would apply as specified under “Adjustments – Method of Adjustment” above, the provisions of this paragraph (b) will apply and Calculation Agent Adjustment shall not apply;

^^**ISDA Early Termination Date**. Party A has the right to designate an Early Termination Date pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement;

^^**Other ISDA Events**. The announcement of any event that if consummated, would result in an Extraordinary Event (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no Additional Disruption Event shall be applicable with respect to the definition of Extraordinary Event contained in the 2002 Definitions) or the occurrence of any Change in Law or a Delisting; provided that in case of a Delisting, in addition to the provisions of Section 12.6(a)(iii) of the 2002 Definitions, it will also constitute a Delisting if the Exchange is located in the United States and the Shares are not immediately re-listed, re-traded or re-quoted on any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NASDAQ Global Market (or their respective successors); and provided further that the definition of “Change in Law” provided in Section 12.9(a)(ii) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended by replacing the phrase “the interpretation” in the third line thereof with the phrase “or public announcement of the formal or informal interpretation”; or

^^**Ownership Event**. In the sole judgment of Party A, on any day, the Share Amount for such day exceeds the Post-Effective Limit for such day (if any applies).

For purposes of clause (e) above, the “Share Amount” as of any day is the number of Shares that Party A and any person whose ownership position would be aggregated with that of Party A (Party A or any such person, a “Party A Person”) under any law, rule, regulation or regulatory order that for any reason becomes applicable to ownership of Shares after the Trade Date (“Applicable Laws”), owns, beneficially owns, constructively owns, controls, holds the power to vote or otherwise meets a relevant definition of ownership of under the Applicable Laws, as determined by Party A in its reasonable discretion. The “Post-Effective Limit” means (x) the minimum number of Shares that would give rise to reporting or registration obligations or other requirements (including obtaining prior approval fro m any person or entity) of a Party A Person, or would result in an adverse effect on a Party A Person, under the Applicable Laws, as determined by Party A in its reasonable discretion, minus (y) [[Percentage 3]]% of the number of Shares outstanding.

Party A represents and warrants to and agrees with Party B that (i) Party A does not know on the Trade Date of any event or circumstance which will cause the Share Amount to exceed the Post Effective Limit on any day during the term of this Transaction and (ii) Party A will not knowingly cause the Share Amount to exceed the Post-Effective Limit on any day during the term of this Transaction for the sole purpose of causing the occurrence of an Acceleration Event.

**Termination Settlement**:  
Upon the occurrence of any Acceleration Event, Party A shall have the right to designate, upon at least one Scheduled Trading Day’s notice, any Scheduled Trading Day following such occurrence to be a Settlement Date hereunder (a “Termination Settlement Date”) to which Physical Settlement shall apply, and to select the number of Settlement Shares relating to such Termination Settlement Date; provided that (i) in the case of an Acceleration Event arising out of an Ownership Event, the number of Settlement Shares so designated by Party A shall not exceed the number of Shares necessary to reduce the Share Amount to the Post-Effective Limit and (ii) in the case of an Acceleration Event arising out of a Stock Borrow Event the number of Settlement Shares so designated by Party A shall not exceed the number of Shares as to which such Stock Borrow Event exists. If, upon designation of a Termination Settlement Date by Party A pursuant to the preceding sentence, Party B fails to deliver the Settlement Shares relating to such Termination Settlement Date when due or otherwise fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of this Transaction, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply.If an Acceleration Event occurs during an Unwind Period relating to a number of Settlement Shares to which Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement applies, then on the Termination Settlement Date relating to such Acceleration Event, notwithstanding any election to the contrary by Party B, Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement shall apply to the portion of the Settlement Shares relating to such Unwind Period as to which Party A has unwound its hedge and Physical Settlement shall apply in respect of (x) the remainder (if any) of such Settlement Shares and (y) the Settlement Shares designated by Party A in respect of such Termination Settlement Date.

**Private Placement Procedures**  
If Party B is unable to comply with the provisions of “Covenant of Party B” above because of a change in law or a change in the policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff, or Party A otherwise determines that in its reasonable opinion any Settlement Shares to be delivered to Party A by Party B may not be freely returned by Party A or its affiliates to securities lenders as described under “Covenant of Party B” above, then delivery of any such Settlement Shares (the “Restricted Shares”) shall be effected pursuant to Annex A hereto, unless waived by Party A.

**Rule 10b5-1**:  
It is the intent of Party A and Party B that following any election of Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement by Party B, the purchase of Shares by Party A during any Unwind Period comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) of the Exchange Act and that this Confirmation shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c).

Party B acknowledges that (i) during any Unwind Period Party B does not have, and shall not attempt to exercise, any influence over how, when or whether to effect purchases of Shares by Party A (or its agent or affiliate) in connection with this Confirmation and (ii) Party B is entering into the Agreement and this Confirmation in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with federal securities laws including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

**Acknowledgements**.  
The parties hereto intend for:

^^Party A to be a “financial institution” within the meaning of Section 101(22) of the Bankruptcy Code; and

^^all payments for, under or in connection with this Transaction, all payments for the Shares and the transfer of such Shares to constitute “settlement payments” as defined in the Bankruptcy Code.

If Party A is a bank regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (i) Party A recognizes and intends that this Transaction is, and shall constitute, a "qualified financial contract" as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(d)(i), as the same may be amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time; and (ii) Party A represents and warrants that it is authorized by appropriate corporate action under applicable law to enter into this Transaction as evidenced by the execution hereof by an officer of Party A at the level of vice president or higher.

**ANNEX A**  

\centered PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROCEDURES

^^^If Party B delivers the Restricted Shares pursuant to this clause (i) (a “Private Placement Settlement”), then delivery of Restricted Shares by Party B shall be effected in customary private placement procedures with respect to such Restricted Shares reasonably acceptable to Party A; provided that if, on or before the date that a Private Placement Settlement would occur, Party B has taken, or caused to be taken, any action that would make unavailable either the exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the sale by Party B to Party A (or any affiliate designated by Party A) of the Restricted Shares or the exemption pursuant to Section 4(1) or Section 4(3) of the Securities Act for resales of the Restricted Shares by Party A (or any such affiliate of Party A) or Party B fails to deliver the Restricted Shares when due or otherwi se fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of a Private Placement Settlement, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply. The Private Placement Settlement of such Restricted Shares shall include customary representations, covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities to Party A, due diligence rights (for Party A or any designated buyer of the Restricted Shares by Party A), opinions and certificates, and such other documentation as is customary for private placement agreements, all reasonably acceptable to Party A. In the case of a Private Placement Settlement, Party A shall, in its good faith discretion, adjust the amount of Restricted Shares to be delivered to Party A hereunder in a commercially reasonable manner to reflect the fact that such Restricted Shares may not be freely returned to securities lenders by Party A and may only be saleable by Party A at a discount to re flect the lack of liquidity in Restricted Shares. Notwithstanding the Agreement or this Confirmation, the date of delivery of such Restricted Shares shall be the Clearance System Business Day following notice by Party A to Party B of the number of Restricted Shares to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i). For the avoidance of doubt, delivery of Restricted Shares shall be due as set forth in the previous sentence and not be due on the Settlement Date or Termination Settlement Date that would otherwise be applicable.

^^^If Party B delivers any Restricted Shares in respect of this Transaction, Party B agrees that (i) such Shares may be transferred by and among Party A and its affiliates and (ii) after the minimum “holding period” within the meaning of Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act has elapsed after the applicable Settlement Date, Party B shall promptly remove, or cause the transfer agent for the Shares to remove, any legends referring to any transfer restrictions from such Shares upon delivery by Party A (or such affiliate of Party A) to Party B or such transfer agent of seller’s and broker’s representation letters customarily delivered by Party A or its affiliates in connection with resales of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, each without any further requirement for the delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of counsel, notice or any other docu ment, any transfer tax stamps or payment of any other amount or any other action by Party A (or such affiliate of Party A).
