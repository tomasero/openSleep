^^^**License Fee Calculation**

Licensor has the option to ‘borrow’ unit volume from a future period for license fee calculation should the cumulated license fee for a given calendar year be below 200,000 Euro. The goal is to generate a minimum license fee for a particular year. Should Licensor choose to use this option, that total license fee amount for the particular calendar year may not exceed 205,000 Euro Unit volumes borrowed from the future period need to be reconciled during the next period in order to accurately reflect real unit sales for the next period.
