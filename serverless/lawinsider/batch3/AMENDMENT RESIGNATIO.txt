^Agency Resignation, Waiver, Consent and Appointment. 

^^As of the Effective Date (as defined below), (i) the Existing Agent hereby resigns as the Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender as provided under Section 9.9 (Successor Administrative Agent) of the Credit Agreement and shall have no further obligations under the Loan Documents in such capacities; (ii) the Required Lenders hereby appoint Barclays as successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (iii) the Borrower and Required Lenders hereby waive any notice requirement provided for under Section 9.9 (Successor Administrative Agent) of the Credit Agreement in respect of such resignation or appointment and the requirement in Section 9.9 (Successor Administrative Agent) that the successor agent must be selected from among the Lenders; (iv) the Borrower and Required Lenders hereby consent to the appointment of the Successor Agent; (v) Barclays hereby accepts its appointment as Successor Agent; (vi) the Successor Agent shall bear no responsibility for any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Existing Agent while the Existing Agent served as Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and (vii) each of the Existing Agent and Borrower authorizes the Successor Agent to file any Uniform Commercial Code assignments or amendments with respect to the Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statements, mortgages, and other filings in respect of the Collateral as the Successor Agent deems necessary or desirable and each party hereto agrees to execute any documentation and to take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to evidence the resignation and appointment described herein; provided that the Existing Agent shall bear no responsibility for any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Successor Agent under this clause (vii). 

^^The parties hereto hereby confirm that the Successor Agent succeeds to the rights and obligations of the Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender under the Credit Agreement and becomes vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender under each of the Loan Documents, and the Existing Agent is discharged from all of its duties and obligations as the Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (other than those under Section 10.14 (Confidentiality)), in each case, as of the Effective Date. 

^^The parties hereto hereby confirm that, as of the Effective Date, all of the provisions of the Credit Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 9 (The Agent) and Section 10.5 (Payment of Expenses) to the extent they pertain to the Existing Agent, continue in effect for the benefit of the Existing Agent, its sub-agents and their respective affiliates in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the Existing Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender and inure to the benefit of the Existing Agent. 

^^The Existing Agent hereby assigns to the Successor Agent each of the Liens and security interests granted to the Existing Agent under the Loan Documents and the Successor Agent hereby assumes all such Liens, for its benefit and for the benefit of the Secured Parties. 

^^Existing Agent hereby agrees to deliver all collateral described on Schedule 2 to the Successor Agent and to perform all actions described on Schedule 4. On and after the Effective Date, all possessory collateral, if any, held by the Existing Agent for the benefit of the Lenders shall be deemed to be held by the Existing Agent as agent and bailee for the Successor Agent for the benefit of the Lenders until such time as such possessory collateral has been delivered to the Successor Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or the effectiveness of the terms hereof, each Loan Party agrees that all of such Liens granted by any Loan Party, shall in all respects be continuing and in effect and are hereby ratified and reaffirmed by each Loan Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any reference to the Existing Agent on any publicly filed document, to the extent such filing relates to the liens and security interests in the Collateral assigned hereby and until such filing is modified to reflect the interests of the Successor Agent, shall, with respect to such liens and security interests, constitute a reference to the Existing Agent as collateral representative of the Successor Agent (provided, that the parties hereto agree that the Existing Agent’s role as such collateral representative shall impose no duties, obligations, or liabilities on the Existing Agent, including, without limitation, any duty to take any type of direction regarding any action to be taken against such Collateral, whether such direction comes from the Successor Agent, the Required Lenders, or otherwise and the Existing Agent shall have the full benefit of the protective provisions of Section 9 (The Agent) including, without limitation, Section 9.7 (Indemnification), while serving in such capacity). The Successor Agent agrees to take possession of any possessory collateral delivered to the Successor Agent following the Effective Date upon tender thereof by the Existing Agent. 

^Revolving Credit Commitment Reduction. The Borrower and each of the Revolving Credit Lenders hereby agrees that, on the Effective Date, the Revolving Credit Commitments of Lehman (which, immediately prior to the Effective Date, are in the aggregate principal amount of $[[USD Value 1: Number]]) shall be reduced to zero ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]) and the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments shall correspondingly be reduced to $[[USD Value 2: Number]] (the “Revolving Credit Commitment Reduction”); provided that solely for the purposes of calculating the “Total Revolving Credit Commitments” at any time of determination (other than as such term is used in the definition of Revolving Credit Percentage), Lehman’s Revolving Credit Commitment shall be deemed to be equal to its Revolving Extensions of Credit at such time. Each of the Revolving Credit Lenders (other than Lehman) hereby agrees that, notwithstanding anything in Section 2.18 (Pro Rata Treatment and Payments) of the Credit Agreement to the contrary, (x) the Revolving Credit Commitment Reduction shall not affect its Revolving Credit Commitment and (y) its Revolving Credit Commitment shall remain the same as its Revolving Credit Commitment immediately prior to the Revolving Credit Commitment Reduction. It is understood and agreed that prior to the earlier (such date, the “Final Revolving Termination Date”) of (x) the Revolving Credit Termination Date or (y) such other date as the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be terminated in full, no prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans shall be made in respect of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans held by Lehman and that Lehman’s ratable share of any such prepayment shall be allocated to the other Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Percentages. The outstanding principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans held by Lehman shall be paid in full, along with any accrued and unpaid fees and interest in respect thereof, on the Final Revolving Termination Date. As of the Effective Date, Lehman shall continue to be a Revolving Lender under the Credit Agreement and shall continue to hold all rights of a Lender and Secured Party thereunder for all purposes (including, without limitation, benefits of collateral security, voting rights, except for purposes of Sections 8(B)(i) and 10.1(iii) of the Credit Agreement, and rights to receive payment of interest on the dates provided in the Credit Agreement on such Revolving Loans).
