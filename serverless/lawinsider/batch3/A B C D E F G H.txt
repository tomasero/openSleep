Note 1

All warrants previously issued to key team players are subsumed within the issuance of warrants on [[Date 1: Date]];

Note 2

The warrants deemed to have vested include (a) [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the new warrants issued on [[Date 1]], plus (b) an agreed number of the previously issued warrants which are now deemed by agreement between the holder and the Company to have vested. The total in (b) is less than the number of warrants that would have been treated as having vested under the previously issued warrant terms by the number shown in column H (and the number of warrants to be vested have been increased by the same amount and spread equally over the future vesting events). This accords with the Company's objective of spreading forward the vesting date of warrants and making future vesting events performance related so as to more directly link the vesting of warrants to key team persons with the success of the Company; 

Note 3

These key team persons are not directors or officers of the Company;

Note 4

Exercisable upon the successful raise of new equity or equity based capital of $[[USD Value 1: Number]] or more;

Note 6

Exercisable when the Company reaches sustainable production levels of electricity and / or biofuels which, according to the Company’s annual board of directors’ approved business plan for that year, are expected to generate sustainable annual EBITDA of at least $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and;

Note 7

Exercisable when, the Company reaches production levels of electricity or biofuels which, according to the Company’s annual board of directors’ approved business plan for that year, are expected to generate sustainable annual EBITDA of at least $[[USD Value 3: Number]]
