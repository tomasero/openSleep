All amounts required to be deposited into the LC Cash Collateral Account shall be made in the Dollar Equivalents of such amounts. 

^^Subsection 2.14(g) is hereby further amended by adding section (iv) as follows: 

^^^If on any Revaluation Date and solely as a result of changes in Exchange Rates, the Letter of Credit Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit denominated in Mexican Pesos exceeds the Peso Denominated Letter of Credit Sublimit (such excess, the “Peso Sublimit Excess”), the Borrower shall promptly deposit with the Administrative Agent additional amounts in Dollars into the LC Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the Peso Sublimit Excess. If on any Revaluation Date and solely as a result of changes in Exchange Rates, the Peso Sublimit Excess ceases to be [[Percentage 3: Number]]% collateralized by amounts deposited in the LC Cash Collateral Account in respect of the Peso Sublimit Excess, then the Borrower shall promptly deposit additional amounts in Dollars into the LC Cash Collateral Account in an amount such that the Peso Sublimit Excess is [[Percentage 2]]% collateralized by amounts deposited in the LC Cash Collateral Account in respect of the Peso Sublimit Excess.

The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “ Judgment Currency”) other than the currency in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “ Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Lender or Issuing Bank to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return, within two Business Days, the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). 

^^The proviso in Section 5.09 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
