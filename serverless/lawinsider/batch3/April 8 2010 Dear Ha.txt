^^**Termination by Company for Cause.** The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, effective immediately, for Cause, which shall be defined as: (i) a Willful and continued material failure to perform Executive’s duties under this Agreement in a satisfactory manner (other than as a result of total or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness or Disability, as defined in Section 13.3 below), where Willful means, when applied to any action or omission made by Executive, that Executive did so without a good faith belief that such action or omission was in, or was not contrary to, the best interests of the Company; (ii) acts of dishonesty, fraud, embezzlement, misrepresentation, and misappropriation involving the Company or any of its affiliates; (iii) unprofessional conduct which may adversely affect the reputation of the Company and/or its relationship with its customers, employees or suppliers ; and (iv) a conviction of, or entry of a guilty plea or no contest to, any crime involving moral turpitude or dishonesty (collectively “Cause”).

In addition, the parties’ obligations hereunder, except as set forth in the attached K12 Employee Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights and Non-Solicitation Agreement, K12Agreement to Arbitrate and Sections 13 and 15 of this Agreement, shall terminate.

13.5.1.      In the event that Executive resigns his or her employment and terminates this Agreement for Good Reason, then, provided that such resignation constitutes a Separation from Service, Executive shall be entitled to the severance pay set forth in Section 13.5.2 below. In addition, the parties’ obligations hereunder, except as set forth in the attached K12 Employee Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights and Non-Solicitation Agreement, K12Agreement to Arbitrate and Sections 13 and 15 of this Agreement, shall terminate. Good Reason shall be defined as any material breach of this Agreement by the Company which is not cured within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof from Executive in the manner provided in Section 15.6 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may not resign his or her employment for Good Reason unless (i) Executive provides the Company prior written notice of his or her intent to resign for Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of any condition constituting Good Reason, (ii) the Company is provided with a period of at least sixty (60) days to remedy such condition and does not remedy the condition within such sixty (60) day period and (iii) Executive’s termination of employment occurs no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the initial existence of the condition constituting Good Reason.

13.5.2.      **Effect of Termination (Severance Pay)**. Upon termination of Executive’s employment and this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 13.4 or by Executive pursuant to Section 13.5.1 above, and provided that such termination constitutes a Separation from Service and provided further that Executive executes and does not revoke a general release of claims satisfactory to the Company within thirty (30) days following the date of termination, Executive shall be entitled to twelve (12) months of severance pay at the then-existing Base Salary, payable in equal installments at the same time and in the same manner as such Base Salary had been paid prior to such termination; provided that any payments required to be made prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of termination of employment (the “First Pay Date”) shall be paid in a single lump sum on the first regularly scheduled payroll date on or following the First Pay Date. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b) (iii)), each payment that Executive may be eligible to receive under this Agreement shall be treated as a separation and distinct payment.

^**Counterparts***.* This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

^**Representations by Executive:** Executive represents and warrants that:

^^Executive is free to enter into and perform each of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Executive is not subject to any agreement, judgment, order or restriction that would be violated by Executive being employed by the Company or that in any way restricts the services that may be rendered by Executive for the Company. Executive’s execution of this Agreement and performance of Executive’s obligations under this Agreement does not and will not violate or breach any other agreement between Executive and any other person or entity. In addition, Executive has disclosed to the Company the educational and religious institutions to which Executive has made charitable contributions and donated his services prior to entering into this Agreement, and the Company has determined that a continuation of those activities after execution of this Agreement, absent a material change in the status of those institutions as they relate to the Company, is consistent with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 

^^^^^ 
^^Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions and covenants in this Agreement and Executive agrees that they will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood after employment with the Company and that they are fair, reasonable and necessary to protect and maintain the proprietary interests, goodwill and other legitimate business interests of the Company in view of the following facts: (i) Executive will hold a position of confidence and trust with the Company as a result of Executive’s employment with the Company, access to confidential financial and other information, and relationship with the customers, suppliers and other employees of the Company, (ii) it would be impossible for Executive to be employed or engaged in a directly competitive business to that of the Company as described in Section 14.1 of this Agreement without inevitably using the Company’s proprietary information, and (iii) Executive has broad skills that will permit gainful employment in many areas and businesses outside the scope of the Company’s business. 

^^Executive acknowledges that but for the above representations and warranties of Executive; the Company would not employ Executive or enter into this Agreement. 

^**Section 409A**.

^^Compliance. In the event that following the date hereof the Company or Executive reasonably determines that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive shall work together to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (x) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement or (y) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance. 

^^In-Kind Benefits and Reimbursements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in-kind benefits and reimbursements provided under this Agreement shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(iv), such that any in-kind benefits and reimbursements provided under this Agreement during any calendar year shall not affect in-kind benefits or reimbursements to be provided in any other calendar year, other than an arrangement providing for the reimbursement of medical expenses referred to in Section 105(b) of the Code, and any in-kind benefits and reimbursements shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, reimbursement requests must be timely submitted by Executive and, if timely submitted, reimbursement payments shall be promptly made to Executive following such submission, but in no event later than [[Date 5: Date]] of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred. In no event shall Executive be entitled to any reimbursement payments after [[Date 5]] of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred. This paragraph shall only apply to in-kind benefits and reimbursements that would result in taxable compensation income to Executive. 

^^Distribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, amounts payable to Executive pursuant to Section 13.5.2 shall be made in reliance upon Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (Separation Pay Plans) or Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (Short-Term Deferrals). However, to the extent any payments are treated as non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, then if Executive is deemed at the time of his Separation from Service to be a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution 

^^^^^ 
under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executive’s termination benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executive’s Separation from Service or (ii) the date of Executive’s death. Upon the earlier of such dates, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 13(c) shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive. Thereafter, payments will resume in accordance with this Agreement. The determination of whether Executive is a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code as of the time of his Separation from Service shall be made by the Company in accordance with the terms of Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance there under (including without limitation Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(i)). This Agreement is intended to be written, administered, interpreted and construed in a manner such that no payment or benefits provided under the Agreement become subject to (a) the gross income inclusion set forth within Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code or (b) the interest and additional tax set forth within Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (together, referred to herein as the “Section 409A Penalties”), including, where appropriate, the construction of defined terms to have meanings that would not cause the imposition of Section 409A Penalties. In no event shall the Company be required to provide a tax gross-up payment to Executive or otherwise reimburse Executive with respect to Section 409A Penalties. 

Please acknowledge your acceptance of employment by signing the enclosed copy of this letter, completing the K12 Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights and Non-Solicitation Agreement and K12 Agreement to Arbitrate, and returning them to me as soon as possible. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Harry, I am personally pleased to welcome you to the K12team and I look forward to working with you toward our mutual success.
