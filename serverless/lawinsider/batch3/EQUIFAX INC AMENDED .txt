\centered **MEETINGS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS**

^**Annual Meeting**. The annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company (the “Annual Meeting”) shall be held during the first five months after the end of each fiscal year of the Company at such time and place, within or without the State of Georgia, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting.

^**Special Meetings**. Special meetings of the Shareholders may be held at the principal office of the Company in the State of Georgia or at such other place, within or without the State of Georgia, as may be named in the call therefor. Such special meetings may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Presiding Director, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting, a majority of the Directors in writing without a meeting, or by unanimous call of the Shareholders.

^**Notice of Meetings**. Unless waived in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code as amended from time to time (the “Code”), a notice of each meeting of Shareholders stating the date, time and place of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date thereof to each Shareholder entitled to vote at that meeting. In the case of an Annual Meeting, the notice need not state the purpose or purposes of the meeting unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Code requires the purpose or purposes to be stated in the notice of the meeting. Any irregularity in such notice shall not affect the validity of the Annual Meeting or any action taken at such meeting. In the case of a special meeting of the Shareholders, the notice of meeting shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and only business within the purpose or purposes described in such notice may be conducted at the meeting.

^**Voting Groups**. “Voting group” as used in these Bylaws means all shares of one or more classes or series that are entitled to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of Shareholders. All shares entitled to vote generally on the matter are for that purpose a single voting group.

^**Quorum**. With respect to shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group on a matter at a meeting of Shareholders, the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Code provides otherwise. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than solely to object to holding the meeting or to transacting business at the meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting pursuant to Section 1.11 of these Bylaws.

^**Vote Required for Action**. If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of Directors) is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, provisions of these Bylaws validly adopted by the Shareholders, or the Code requires a greater number of affirmative votes. If the Articles of Incorporation or the Code provide for voting by two or more voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately.

^**Adjournments**. Whether or not a quorum is present to organize a meeting, any meeting of Shareholders (including an adjourned meeting) may be adjourned by the holders of a majority of the voting shares represented at the meeting to reconvene at a specific time and place, but no later than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting unless the requirements of the Code concerning the selection of a new record date have been met.

^**Presiding Officer**. The Chairman of the Board shall call the meeting of the Shareholders to order and shall act as chairman of such meeting. In the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the meeting shall be called to order by any one of the following officers or Directors then present, in the following order: the Presiding Director, the Chief Executive Officer , or Corporate Vice President by seniority in title, who shall act as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary of the Company shall act as secretary of the meeting of the Shareholders. In the absence of the Secretary, at any meeting of the Shareholders, the presiding officer may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

^**Voting of Shares**. Unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Code provides otherwise, each outstanding share having voting rights shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of Shareholders.

^**Proxies**. A Shareholder entitled to vote pursuant to Section 1.9 may vote in person or by proxy pursuant to an appointment of proxy executed by the Shareholder either in writing or pursuant to an electronic or telephonic transmission, provided that the transmission contains or is accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the Shareholder authorized the transmission. An appointment of proxy shall be valid for only one meeting to be specified therein, and any adjournments of such meeting, but shall not be valid for more than eleven months unless expressly provided therein. Appointments of proxy shall be dated and filed with the records of the meeting to which they relate. If the validity of any appointment of proxy is questioned, it must be submitted for examination to the Secretary of the Company or to a proxy officer or committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The Secretary or, if appointed by the Board of Directors, the proxy officer, inspector of election or committee shall determine the validity or invalidity of any appointment of proxy submitted, and reference by the Secretary in the minutes of the meeting to the regularity of an appointment of proxy shall be received as prima facie evidence of the facts stated for the purpose of establishing the presence of a quorum at the meeting and for all other purposes.

^**Record Date**. For the purpose of determining Shareholders entitled to notice of a meeting of the Shareholders, to demand a special meeting, to vote, or to take any other action, the Board of Directors may fix a future date as the record date, which date shall be not more than 70 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring a determination of the Shareholders, is to be taken. A determination of the Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Shareholders is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the 70th day preceding the date on which the particular action, requiring a determination of the Shareholders, is to be taken shall be the record date for that purpose.

^**Shareholder Proposals and Nominations**.

^^No proposal for a Shareholder vote shall be submitted by a Shareholder (a “Shareholder Proposal”) to the Company’s Shareholders unless the Shareholder submitting such proposal (the “Proponent”) shall have filed a written notice setting forth with particularity (i) the names and business addresses of the Proponent and all natural persons, corporations, partnerships, trusts or any other type of legal entity or recognized ownership vehicle (collectively, a “Person”) acting in concert with the Proponent; (ii) the name and address of the Proponent and the Persons identified in clause (i), as they appear on the Company’s books (if they so appear); (iii) the class and number of shares of the Company beneficially owned by the Proponent and by each Person identified in clause (i); (iv) a description of the Shareholder Proposal containing all material information relating thereto; (v) for proposals sought to be included in the Company’s proxy statement, any other information required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 14a-8; and (vi) such other information as the Board of Directors reasonably determines is necessary or appropriate to enable the Board of Directors and Shareholders of the Company to consider the Shareholder Proposal. The presiding officer at any meeting of the Shareholders may determine that any Shareholder Proposal was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in these Bylaws or is otherwise not in accordance with law, and if it is so determined, such officer shall so declare at the meeting and the Shareholder Proposal shall be disregarded.

^^Only persons who are selected and recommended by the Board of Directors or the committee of the Board of Directors designated to make nominations, or who are nominated by Shareholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.12, shall be eligible for election, or qualified to serve, as Directors. Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Directors of the Company at any Annual Meeting or any special meeting of Shareholders at which Directors are to be elected may be made by any Shareholder of the Company entitled to vote for the election of Directors at that meeting by compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.12. Nominations by Shareholders shall be made by written notice (a “Nomination Notice”), which shall set forth (i) as to each individual nominated, (A) the name, date of birth, business address and residence address of such individual; (B) the business experience during the past five years of such nominee, including his or her principal occupations and employment during such period, the name and principal business of any corporation or other organization in which such occupations and employment were carried on, and such other information as to the nature of his or her responsibilities and level of professional competence as may be sufficient to permit assessment of such prior business experience; (C) whether the nominee is or has ever been at any time a director, officer or owner of five percent or more of any class of capital stock, partnership interests or other equity interest of any corporation, partnership or other entity; (D) any directorships held by such nominee in any company with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or subject to the requirements of Section 15(d) of such Act or any company registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; (E) whether such nominee has ever been convicted in a criminal proceeding or has ever been subject to a judgment, order, finding or decree of any federal, state or other governmental entity, concerning any violation of federal, state or other law, or any proceeding in bankruptcy, which conviction, order, finding, decree or proceeding may be material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of the nominee; and (F) all other information relating to such individual that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of Directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended; and (ii) as to the Person submitting the Nomination Notice and any Person acting in concert with such Person, (X) the name and business address of such Person, (Y) the name and address of such Person as they appear on the Company’s books (if they so appear), and (Z) the class and number of shares of the Company that are beneficially owned by such Person. A written consent to being named in a proxy statement as a nominee, and to serve as a Director if elected, signed by the nominee, shall be filed with any Nomination Notice, together with evidence satisfactory to the Company that such nominee has no interests that would limit his or her ability to fulfill his or her duties of office. If the presiding officer at any meeting of the Shareholders determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, such officer shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

^^If a Shareholder Proposal or Nomination Notice is to be submitted at an Annual Meeting of the Shareholders, it shall be delivered to and received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company at least 120 days before the first anniversary of the date that the Company’s proxy statement was released to Shareholders in connection with the previous year’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. However, if no Annual Meeting of the Shareholders was held in the previous year or if the date of the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders has been changed by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, the notice shall be delivered to and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the last to occur of (i) the date that is 150 days prior to the date of the contemplated Annual Meeting or (ii) the date that is 10 days after the date of the first public announcement or other notification to the Shareholders of the date of the contemplated Annual Meeting. Subject to Section 1.3 as to matters that may be acted upon at a special meeting of the Shareholders, if a Shareholder Proposal or Nomination Notice is to be submitted at a special meeting of the Shareholders, it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company no later than the close of business on the earlier of (i) the 30th day following the public announcement that a matter will be submitted to a vote of the Shareholders at a special meeting, or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which notice of the special meeting was given. In addition, if a Shareholder intends to solicit proxies from the Shareholders of the Company for any meeting of the Shareholders, such Shareholder shall notify the Company of this intent in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 14a-4.

\centered **BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

^**General**. Subject to the Articles of Incorporation, all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon it by these Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may exercise all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the Shareholders.

^**Number of Directors and Term of Office**. The number of Directors constituting the Board shall be consistent with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board. A Director may resign from the Board at any time by delivering notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective on such later date as is specified therein (or, if no such date is specified, upon delivery); provided, that, if so specified in such resignation or so provided by the Company’s Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues or other Board-adopted policy in effect from time to time, the effectiveness of a Director’s resignation may be conditioned upon its acceptance by the Board or upon the happening of another event, and the effective date thereof may be determined by the happening of such event. A resignation that is conditioned upon the happening of another event may provide that it is irrevocable. Directors shall have terms of office as provided in the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.

^**Election of Directors**. Except as provided in Section 2.4 of these Bylaws or by applicable law, each Director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock voting together as a single class with respect to the Director at any meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that, if as of a date that is ten (10) days in advance of the date the Company files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected in such election (a “contested election”), the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a Director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that Director. If Directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in a contested election, shareholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall establish and submit to the Board of Directors for approval policies pursuant to which any incumbent Director who is not re-elected by a majority of the votes cast in an election in which such majority is required shall offer his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether or not to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committee’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of certification of the election results. If, for any cause, and except as provided in Section 2.4 of these Bylaws or by applicable law, Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.

^**Vacancies**. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of Directors or from prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office of a Director shall be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining Director. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of Directors or from the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office of a Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until the Director’s successor has been duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of authorized Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director.

^**Term Limits**. A Director reaching 72 years of age (or 65 years of age for Directors who are also employees of the Company) shall submit his or her resignation from the Board. A Director who changes his or her employer or otherwise has a significant change in job responsibilities or other business or professional relationships after his or her most recent election to the Board shall also submit his or her resignation from the Board. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Director may, at the request of the Governance Committee and if ratified by the Board, continue to serve as a Director after the normal retirement age or after a change of employer or job responsibilities or other relationships, if he or she continues in a position or in business or professional activities, or possesses special qualifications, that the Governance Committee and Board determine would be of substantial benefit to the Company. Any such continuation shall be for such period or periods as the Governance Committee, subject to the approval of the Board, shall elect.

^**Stock Ownership Requirement**. Every Director shall be a Shareholder of the Company. Directors shall serve for the terms for which they are elected and until their successors shall have been duly chosen, unless any such term is sooner ended as herein permitted; provided, however, that if a Director ceases to be a Shareholder, the disposition of the stock shall constitute a resignation of the Director’s office as a Director.

^**Regular Meetings**. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time.

^**Special Meetings**. Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the Presiding Director, or the Chief Executive Officer. Special meetings of the Board may also be called by one-third of the Directors then in office. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business of the Company may be transacted at any special meeting of the Board of Directors.

^**Notice of Meetings**. Unless waived in accordance with the Code, notice of each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors, stating the date, time and place of the meeting, shall be given not less than two days before the date thereof to each Director.

^**Quorum; Adjournments**. Unless the Code, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws provide for a different number, a majority of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Whether or not a quorum is present to organize a meeting, any meeting of Directors (including a reconvened meeting) may be adjourned by a majority of the Directors present, to reconvene at a specific time and place. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that could have been transacted at the meeting prior to adjournment. If notice of the original meeting was properly given, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted if the date, time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting prior to adjournment.

^**Vote Required for Action**. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors present is the act of the Board of Directors unless the Code, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws provide for the vote of a different number of Directors or of specific Directors.

^**Action by Directors Without a Meeting**. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any meeting of the non-management Directors or any action that may be taken at a meeting of a committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members of the Board of Directors, all the non-management Directors, or all the members of the committee, as the case may be. The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each Director, each non-management Director or each Director serving on the committee, as the case may be, and delivered to the Company for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records or evidenced in any other manner effective under the Code.

^**Compensation of Directors**. Directors who are salaried officers or employees of the Company shall receive no additional compensation for service as a Director or as a member of a committee of the Board of Directors. Each Director who is not a salaried officer or employee of the Company shall be compensated as determined by the Board of Directors.

^**Presiding Director**. If the Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, then one of the non-management Directors will be named as Presiding Director. **In addition to presiding at the executive sessions of the non-employee directors, the Presiding Director powers or duties shall include:**

**advising the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of decisions reached, and suggestions made, at executive sessions;**

**calling meetings of the non-employee directors;**

**presiding at each Board meeting at which the Chairman is not present;**

**reviewing and approving the agenda, schedule and materials;**

**facilitation communication between the non-employee directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;**

**meeting directly with management and non-management employees of the Company; and**

**if requested by major shareholders, being available for consultation and direct communication.**

The Presiding Director will act as a key liaison with the Chief Executive Officer, will chair the executive sessions of the Board, and will communicate Board member feedback to the Chief Executive Officer, though all directors may continue to interact directly with the Chief Executive Officer as needed and appropriate. The Presiding Director will be elected annually by majority vote of the non-management Directors after consultation with the Governance Committee. The Presiding Director shall have no greater obligations (fiduciary or otherwise) or liabilities than those of other directors by reason of serving as Presiding Director. The Presiding Director shall not be a current employee of the Company nor **have** been employed by the Company at any time within the past five years. The Presiding Director may be removed as Presiding Director at any time with or without cause by vote of a majority of the non-management Directors.

\centered **COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

^**Standing Committees and Membership**. The standing committees of the Board of Directors shall be the Executive Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation, [[Organization 1 Name]] Succession Committee, Finance Committee and Governance Committee, **and Technology Committee,** each of which shall have and may exercise the powers and authority of the Board of Directors to the extent provided in the charters of each committee adopted by the Board in one or more resolutions except as prohibited by the Code. Subject to these Bylaws, the number of members of each committee shall be fixed by the Board of Directors from time to time by resolution. The members of each such committee shall be elected by the Board of Directors from among the members of the Board of Directors. A director may concurrently serve on more than one of such committees. Only a director who is an “independent director,” determined in accordance with the Listed Company Manual of the New York Stock Exchange, shall be eligible to serve as a member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation, [[Organization 1 Name]] Succession Committee or the Governance Committee.

The members of each of the standing committees of the Board of Directors and the chairperson thereof shall be elected at the regular annual meeting of the Board of Directors, or at such other time as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors, and shall hold office until the next such annual meeting of the Board of Directors and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified; provided, however, that vacancies during the year on any standing committee shall be filled by the Board of Directors.

Each committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings and actions and shall submit a report thereto at the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

^**Authority of Committees**. No committee shall have authority to perform any act which may not be delegated to a committee under the Code.

Between meetings of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee may exercise any and all powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company with the same effect as if exercised by the Board of Directors. All actions by the Executive Committee shall be reported to the Board of Directors at its meeting next succeeding such action, and shall be subject to revision or alteration by the Board of Directors, provided that no rights or interests of third parties shall be affected by any such revision or alteration.

^**Other Committees**. The powers and duties of committees other than the Executive Committee shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

^^“Disinterested Director” or “Disinterested Officer” means a Director or Officer, respectively, who at the time of an evaluation referred to in subsection 5.5(b) is not:

^A Party to the Proceeding; or  
^An individual having a familial, financial, professional, or employment relationship with the person whose advance for Expenses is the subject of the decision being made with respect to the Proceeding, which relationship would, in the circumstances, reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the Director’s or Officer’s judgment when voting on the decision being made.

^^“Liability” means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty, fine (including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan), and reasonable Expenses incurred with respect to a Proceeding.

^**Basic Indemnification Arrangement**.

^^The Company shall indemnify an individual who is a Party to a Proceeding because he or she is or was a Director or Officer against Liability incurred in the Proceeding; provided, however, that the Company shall not indemnify a Director or Officer under this Article for any Liability incurred in a Proceeding in which the Director or Officer is adjudged liable to the Company or is subjected to injunctive relief in favor of the Company:

^For any appropriation, in violation of his or her duties, of any business opportunity of the Company;

^For acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

^For the types of liability set forth in Section 14-2-832 of the Code; or

^For any transaction from which he or she received an improper personal benefit.

^^If any person is entitled under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Company for some portion of Liability incurred, but not the total amount thereof, the Company shall indemnify such person for the portion of such Liability to which such person is entitled.

^**Advances for Expenses**.  
^^The Company shall, before final disposition of a Proceeding, advance funds to pay for or reimburse the reasonable Expenses incurred by a Director or Officer who is a Party to a Proceeding because he or she is a Director or Officer if he or she delivers to the Company:

If a Director or Officer seeks to enforce his or her rights to indemnification in a court pursuant to Section 5.4 below, such undertaking to repay shall not be applicable or enforceable unless and until there is a final court determination that he or she is not entitled to indemnification, as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or have expired.

^**Court-Ordered Indemnification and Advances for Expenses**. A Director or Officer who is a Party to a Proceeding shall have the rights to court-ordered indemnification and advances for expenses as provided in the Code.

^**Determination of Reasonableness of Expenses**.

^^The Company acknowledges that indemnification of, and advance expenses to, a Director or Officer under Section 5.2 has been pre-authorized by the Company as permitted by Section 14-2-859(a) of the Code, and that pursuant to the authority exercised under Section 14-2-856 of the Code, no determination need be made for a specific Proceeding that such indemnification of or advances of expenses to the Director or Officer is permissible in the circumstances because he or she has met a particular standard of conduct. Nevertheless, except as set forth in subsection 5.5(b) below, evaluation as to reasonableness of Expenses of a Director or Officer for a specific Proceeding shall be made as follows:

^If there are two or more Disinterested Directors, by the Board of Directors of the Company by a majority vote of all Disinterested Directors (a majority of whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum) or by a majority of the members of a committee of two or more Disinterested Directors appointed by such a vote; or

^If there are fewer than two Disinterested Directors, by the Board of Directors (in which determination Directors who do not qualify as Disinterested Directors may participate); or

^By the Shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a Director or Officer who at the time does not qualify as a Disinterested Director or Disinterested Officer may not be voted on the determination.

^^Notwithstanding the requirement under subsection 5.5(a) that the Reviewing Party evaluate the reasonableness of Expenses claimed by the proposed indemnitee, any Expenses claimed by the proposed indemnitee shall be deemed reasonable if the Reviewing Party fails to make the evaluation required by subsection 5.5(a) within sixty (60) days following the later of:

^The Company’s receipt of the affirmative undertaking required by Section 5.3(a); or

^The Company’s receipt of invoices for specific Expenses to be reimbursed or advanced.

Any indemnification, or payment of Expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding, shall be made promptly and in any event within 60 days, upon the written request of the Director or Officer entitled to indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”). The right to indemnification and advance of Expenses hereunder shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Party in any court of competent jurisdiction, if (i) the Company denies such request, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition thereof is made within 60 days. The Indemnified Party’s Expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Company.

^**Indemnification of Employees and Agents**. The Company may indemnify and advance Expenses under this Article to an employee or agent of the Company who is not a Director or Officer to the same extent and subject to the same conditions that a Georgia corporation could, without shareholder approval under Section 14-2-856 of the Code, indemnify and advance Expenses to a Director, or to any lesser extent (or greater extent if permitted by law) determined by the Board of Directors or Chief Executive Officer, in each case consistent with public policy.

^**Liability Insurance**. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Company or who, while a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Company, is or was serving at the Company’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other entity against Liability asserted against or incurred by him or her in that capacity or arising from his or her status as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent, whether or not the corporation would have power to indemnify or advance Expenses to him or her against the same Liability under this Article or the Code.

The rights of a Director or Officer hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise that he or she may have under contract or the Code or otherwise.

No amendment, modification or rescission of this Article, or any provision hereof, the effect of which would diminish the rights to indemnification or advancement of Expenses as set forth herein shall be effective as to any person with respect to any action taken or omitted by such person prior to such amendment, modification or rescission.
