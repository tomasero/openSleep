From time to time thereafter, Seller shall execute and file such financing statements and cause to be executed and filed such continuation statements, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and protect the interest of Purchaser under this Agreement, of the Issuer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement and of the Trust Collateral Agent under the Indenture in the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property and in the proceeds thereof. Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to Purchaser, the Trust Collateral Agent and the Insurer file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provided above, as soon as available following such filing. In the event that Seller fails to perform its obligations under this subsection, Purchaser, Issuer or the Trust Collateral Agent may do so, at the expense of the Seller. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Seller hereby authorizes the Purchaser, the Issuer or the Trust Collateral Agent to file a record or records (as defined in the applicable UCC), including, without limitation, financing statements, in all jurisdictions and with all filing offices as each may determine, in its sole discretion, are necessary or advisable to perfect the security interest granted to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.9 of this Agreement. Such financing statements may describe the collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that describes such property in any other manner as such party may determine, in its sole discretion, is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the collateral granted to the Purchaser herein.

Seller shall maintain its computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale under this Agreement of the Receivables to Purchaser, and the conveyance of the Receivables by Purchaser to the Issuer, Seller’s master computer records (including archives) that shall refer to a Receivable indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold to Purchaser and has been conveyed by Purchaser to the Issuer. Indication of the Issuer’s ownership of a Receivable shall be deleted from or modified on Seller’s computer systems when, and only when, the Receivable shall become a Purchased Receivable or a Sold Receivable or shall have been paid in full or sold pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. 

^^If at any time Seller shall propose to sell, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in any motor vehicle receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, Seller shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender, or other transferee computer tapes, records, or print-outs (including any restored from archives) that, if they shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable (other than a Purchased Receivable or a Sold Receivable), shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold to Purchaser, sold by Purchaser to Issuer, and is owned by the Issuer. 

^Other Liens or Interests. Except for the conveyances hereunder, Seller will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on the Receivables or the Other Conveyed Property or any interest therein, and Seller shall defend the right, title, and interest of Purchaser and the Issuer in and to the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property against all claims of third parties claiming through or under Seller.

Upon the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Seller shall, unless the breach which is the subject of such Repurchase Event shall have been cured in all material respects, repurchase the Receivable relating thereto from the Issuer, if and only if the interests of the Noteholders or the Insurer therein are materially and adversely affected by any such breach and, simultaneously with the repurchase of the Receivable, Seller shall deposit the Purchase Amount in full, without deduction or offset, to the Collection Account, pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. It is understood and agreed that, except as set forth in Section 6.1 hereof, the obligation of Seller to repurchase any Receivable, as to which a breach occurred and is continuing, shall, if such obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against Seller for such breach available to Purchaser, the Issuer, the Insurer, the Backup Servicer, the Noteholders, the Certificateholder, the Trust Collateral Agent on behalf of the Noteholders or the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholder. The provisions of this Section 5.1 are intended to grant the Issuer, the Insurer and the Trust Collateral Agent a direct right against Seller to demand performance hereunder, and in connection therewith, Seller waives any requirement of prior demand against Purchaser with respect to such repurchase obligation. Any such repurchase shall take place in the manner specified in Section 3.2 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Sale and Servicing Agreement to the contrary, the obligation of Seller under this Section shall not terminate upon a termination of Seller as Servicer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement and shall be performed in accordance with the terms hereof notwithstanding the failure of the Servicer or Purchaser to perform any of their respective obligations with respect to such Receivable under the Sale and Servicing Agreement. 

In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding whether the related Receivable shall have been purchased by Seller, Seller shall indemnify the Issuer, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the Insurer, the Noteholders and the Certificateholder from and against all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them as a result of third party claims arising out of the events or facts giving rise to such Repurchase Events.

Upon deposit in the Collection Account of the Purchase Amount of any Receivable repurchased by Seller under Section 5.1 hereof, Purchaser and the Issuer shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by Seller in order to assign to Seller all of Purchaser’s and the Issuer’s right, title and interest in and to such Receivable and all security and documents and all Other Conveyed Property conveyed to Purchaser and the Issuer directly relating thereto, without recourse, representation or warranty, except as to the absence of Liens created by or arising as a result of actions of Purchaser or the Issuer. Such assignment shall be a sale and assignment outright, and not for security. If, following the reassignment of a Purchased Receivable, in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding, it is held that Seller may not enforce any such Receivable on the ground that it shall not be a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Receivable, Purchaser and the Issuer shall, at the expense of Seller, take such steps as Seller deems reasonably necessary to enforce the Receivable, including bringing suit in Purchaser’s or in the Issuer’s name. 

^Waivers. No failure or delay on the part of Purchaser, or the Issuer as assignee of Purchaser, or the Trust Collateral Agent as assignee of the Issuer, in exercising any power, right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or remedy preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or remedy. 

\centered **MISCELLANEOUS** 

^Liability of Seller. Seller shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations in this Agreement specifically undertaken by Seller and the representations and warranties of Seller. 

^Merger or Consolidation of Seller or Purchaser. Any corporation or other entity (i) into which Seller or Purchaser may be merged or consolidated, (ii) resulting from any merger or consolidation to which Seller or Purchaser is a party or (iii) succeeding to the business of Seller or Purchaser, in the case of Purchaser, which corporation has a certificate of incorporation containing provisions relating to limitations on business and other matters substantively identical to those contained in Purchaser’s certificate of incorporation, provided that in any of the foregoing cases such corporation shall execute an agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, under this Agreement and, whether or not such assumption agreement is executed, shall be the successor to Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, hereunder (without relieving Seller or Purchaser of their responsibilities hereunder, if it survives such merger or consolidation) without the execution or filing of any document or any further action by any of the parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as an Insurer Default shall not have occurred and be continuing, Purchaser shall not merge or consolidate with any other Person or permit any other Person to become the successor to Purchaser’s business without the prior written consent of the Insurer. Seller or Purchaser shall promptly inform the other party, the Issuer, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Owner Trustee and, so long as an Insurer Default shall not have occurred and be continuing, the Insurer of such merger, consolidation or purchase and assumption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, (x) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no representation or warranty made pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this Agreement shall have been breached (for purposes hereof, such representations and warranties shall speak as of the date of the consummation of such transaction) and no event that, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default under the Insurance Agreement, shall have occurred and be continuing, (y) Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall have delivered written notice of such consolidation, merger or purchase and assumption to the Rating Agencies prior to the consummation of such transaction and shall have delivered to the Issuer, the Insurer and the Trust Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate of the Seller or a certificate signed by or on behalf of the Purchaser, as applicable, and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such consolidation, merger or succession and such agreement of assumption comply with this Section 6.2 and that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Agreement relating to such transaction have been complied with, and (z) Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Issuer, the Insurer and the Trust Collateral Agent an Opinion of Counsel, stating, in the opinion of such counsel, either (A) all financing statements and continuation statements and amendments thereto have been executed and filed that are necessary to preserve and protect the interest of the Issuer and the Trust Collateral Agent in the Receivables and reciting the details of the filings or (B) no such action shall be necessary to preserve and protect such interest. 

^Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others. Seller and any director, officer, employee or agent thereof may rely in good faith on the advice of counsel or on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising under this Agreement. Seller shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is not incidental to its obligations under this Agreement or its Related Documents and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability. 

^Seller May Own Notes or the Certificate. Subject to the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, Seller and any Affiliate of Seller may in their individual or any other capacity become the owner or pledgee of Notes or the Certificate with the same rights as they would have if they were not Seller or an Affiliate thereof. 

^Amendment. 

^^This Agreement may be amended by Seller and Purchaser with the prior written consent of the Insurer (so long as an Insurer Default shall not have occurred and be continuing) but without the consent of the Trust Collateral Agent, the Owner Trustee, the Certificateholder or any of the Noteholders (i) to cure any ambiguity or (ii) to correct any provisions in this Agreement; provided, however, that such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Insurer and the Trust Collateral Agent, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Noteholder or, if an Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Insurer. 

^^This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by Seller and Purchaser, with the prior written consent of the Insurer (so long as an Insurer Default shall not have occurred and be continuing) and with the consent of the Trust Collateral Agent and, if required, the Certificateholder and the Noteholders, in accordance with the Sale and Servicing Agreement, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement, or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholder or Noteholders; provided, however, the Seller provides the Trust Collateral Agent with an Opinion of Counsel, (which may be provided by the Seller’s internal counsel) that no such amendment shall increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of payments on Receivables or distributions that shall be required to be made on any Note or Certificate; provided further that if an Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing, such amendment shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Insurer. 

^^Prior to the execution of any such amendment or consent, Seller shall have furnished written notification of the substance of such amendment or consent to each Rating Agency. 

^^It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholder or Noteholders pursuant to this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholder or Noteholders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements as the Trust Collateral Agent may prescribe, including the establishment of record dates. The consent of a Holder of a Certificate or a Note given pursuant to this Section or pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and on all future Holders of such Certificate or Note and of any Certificate or Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange thereof or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent is made upon the Certificate or Note. 

^Notices. All demands, notices and communications to Seller or Purchaser hereunder shall be in writing, personally delivered, or sent by telecopier (subsequently confirmed in writing), reputable overnight courier or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt (a) in the case of Seller, to [[Seller]], [[Address 1: Address]], Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or (b) in the case of Purchaser, to [[Purchaser]], [[Address 2: Address]], Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or such other address as shall be designated by a party in a written notice delivered to the other party or to the Issuer, Owner Trustee, the Insurer or the Trust Collateral Agent, as applicable. 

^Merger and Integration. Except as specifically stated otherwise herein, this Agreement and Related Documents set forth the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and all prior understandings, written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement and the Related Documents. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, waived or supplemented except as provided herein. 

^Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the covenants, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. 

^Intention of the Parties. The execution and delivery of this Agreement shall constitute an acknowledgment by Seller and Purchaser that they intend that the assignment and transfer herein contemplated constitute a sale and assignment outright, and not for security, of the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property, conveying good title thereto free and clear of any Liens, from Seller to Purchaser, and that the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property shall not be a part of Seller’s estate in the event of the bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding, or other proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, or the occurrence of another similar event, of, or with respect to Seller. In the event that such conveyance is determined to be made as security for a loan made by Purchaser, the Issuer, the Noteholders or the Certificateholder to Seller, the Seller hereby grants to Purchaser a security interest in all of Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the following property, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising, and this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law (collectively, the “Purchase Agreement Collateral”): 

^the Receivables and all moneys received thereon after the Cutoff Date; 

^the security interests in the Financed Vehicles granted by Obligors pursuant to the Receivables and any other interest of the Seller in such Financed Vehicles; 

^any proceeds and the right to receive proceeds with respect to the Receivables from claims on any physical damage, credit life or disability insurance policies covering Financed Vehicles or Obligors and any proceeds from the liquidation of the Receivables; 

^any proceeds from any Receivable repurchased by a Dealer pursuant to a Dealer Agreement or a Third-Party Lender pursuant to an Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement as a result of a breach of representation or warranty in the related Dealer Agreement or Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement; 

^all rights under any Service Contracts on the related Financed Vehicles; 

^the related Receivable Files; 

^all of the Seller’s (i) Accounts, (ii) Chattel Paper, (iii) Documents, (iv) Instruments and (v) General Intangibles (as such terms are defined in the UCC) relating to the property described in (1) through (6); and 

^all proceeds and investments with respect to items (1) through (7). 

^Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and this Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law). 

^Counterparts. For the purpose of facilitating the execution of this Agreement and for other purposes, this Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which counterparts shall constitute but one and the same instrument. 

^Conveyance of the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property to the Issuer. Seller acknowledges that Purchaser intends, pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, to convey the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property, together with its rights under this Agreement, to the Issuer on the Closing Date. Seller acknowledges and consents to such conveyance and pledge and waives any further notice thereof and covenants and agrees that the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and the rights of Purchaser hereunder are intended to benefit the Insurer, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Noteholders and the Certificateholder. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller covenants and agrees to perform its duties and obligations hereunder, in accordance with the terms hereof for the benefit of the Insurer, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Noteholders and the Certificateholder and that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall be directly liable to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Noteholders and the Certificateholder (notwithstanding any failure by the Servicer, the Backup Servicer or the Purchaser to perform its respective duties and obligations hereunder or under Related Documents) and that the Trust Collateral Agent may enforce the duties and obligations of Seller under this Agreement against Seller for the benefit of the Insurer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Noteholders and the Certificateholder. 

^Nonpetition Covenant. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall petition or otherwise invoke the process of any court or government authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against the Purchaser or the Issuer under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Purchaser or the Issuer or any substantial part of their respective property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Purchaser or the Issuer. 

^Benefits of Purchase Agreement. The Insurer and its successors and assigns shall be a third-party beneficiary to the provisions of this Purchase Agreement and shall be entitled to rely upon and directly enforce the provisions of this Purchase Agreement so long as no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing; *provided*, *however*, that any right or benefit expressly granted to the Insurer under this Agreement shall survive and the Insurer shall remain a third-party beneficiary hereunder to enforce such right or obtain such benefit, notwithstanding the occurrence and continuance of an Insurer Default, unless such right or benefit is expressly conditioned upon no Insurer Default having occurred and be continuing.
