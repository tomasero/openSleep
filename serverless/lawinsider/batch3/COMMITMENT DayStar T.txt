\centered [[Organization 1 Name]] 

We are pleased to offer this Commitment for [[Organization 2 Name]] (“Bighorn”) to use its best efforts to arrange and/or fund the proposed financing through which [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc. (“Borrower”) will receive funds to finance the purchase of certain equipment, currently on order from manufacturers/suppliers in Europe, and equipment already delivered and paid for, which collectively shall herein be known as the “Property”. Bighorn understands that the aggregate purchase price for the Property, including the cost of delivery to Borrower in California, is approximately $[[USD Value 1: Number]] against which Borrower has paid cash deposits aggregating approximately $[[USD Value 2: Number]] and previously paid for equipment of $[[USD Value 3: Number]] 

This Commitment supersedes all previous communications and correspondence without limitation. The outline of these terms and conditions are as follows: 

**BORROWER:**      [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc.

**LENDER**:      Bighorn and/or any other Lender designated by Bighorn (collectively, “Lender”). Bighorn reserves the right to assign or sell participations in all or part of the loan described herein (the “Loan”).

**GUARANTOR:**      [[Organization 1 Name]], Inc.

**LOAN AMOUNT:**      The lesser of (i) [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of the delivered and installed total purchase price for such equipment and all prior indebtedness, or $[[USD Value 4: Number]] or (ii) [[Percentage 1]]% of the value of such equipment (as determined by the equipment lender in its sole judgment), provided that the final loan amount is not less than $[[USD Value 5: Number]]

**RATE:**      6-month LIBOR + 350 Basis Points, calculated based on a 360-day year and charged for actual days elapsed.

**LOAN FEE:**      [[Percentage 2: Number]]% of the final Loan amount and payable at closing. Fee is without deduction of any bank charges, discounts, or closing costs that may be charged to borrower. This Fee is due and payable upon close of financing covered herein.

If Bighorn provides the Equipment Loan as contemplated in this Commitment, Borrower will issue, to such designee as Bighorn and [[Organization 4 Name]] (“Dynamic”) shall designate, seven-year Warrants for the Purchase of Shares of Borrower’s Common Stock, at an exercise price of $.30 per share, as more fully described (and subject to the conditions in) a separate letter agreement dated [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Omnibus Agreement”) among Borrower, Bighorn and Dynamic. Borrower agrees that if these Warrants are not issued as required by the Omnibus Agreement, Bighorn has the right to lien Borrower’s corporate assets until such time as this issue is resolved.

**TERM:**      Five (5) years from the Closing Date. Interest payable monthly. At the end of the Loan Term, the full amount of the Loan plus any accrued interest is due and payable.
