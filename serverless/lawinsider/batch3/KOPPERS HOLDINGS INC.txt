\centered RECITALS 

^The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees, non-employee directors of the Board (or the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary) and consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). 

^Participant is to render valuable services to the Corporation (or a Parent or Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Corporation’s issuance of shares of Common Stock to Participant under the Plan. 

^All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix A. 

NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows: 

^Grant of Restricted Stock Units. The Corporation hereby awards to Participant, as of the Award Date, Restricted Stock Units under the Plan. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock on the specified issuance date following the vesting of that unit. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the awarded Restricted Stock Units, the applicable vesting schedule for those shares, the date on which those vested shares shall become issuable to Participant and the remaining terms and conditions governing the award (the “Award”) shall be as set forth in this Agreement. 

\centered AWARD SUMMARY 

Award Date:      [[Date 1: Date]]

Number of Shares Subject to Award:      ________ shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”)

Vesting Schedule:      The Shares shall vest upon Participant’s completion of a consecutive three (3)-year period of Service measured from the Award Date. However, one or more Shares may be subject to accelerated vesting in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.

Issuance Schedule:      The Shares in which Participant vests in accordance with the foregoing Vesting Schedule shall become issuable immediately upon vesting (the “Issue Date”). The actual issuance of the Shares shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of all applicable Withholding Taxes and shall be effected on the applicable Issue Date or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but in no event later than the close of the calendar year in which such Issue Date occurs or (if later) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar month following such Issue Date. The procedures pursuant to which the applicable Withholding Taxes are to be collected are set forth in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement.

^Limited Transferability. Prior to the actual issuance of the Shares which vest hereunder, Participant may not transfer any interest in the Award or the underlying Shares; provided, however, any Shares which vest hereunder but which otherwise remain unissued at the time of Participant’s death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of Participant’s will or the laws of inheritance or to Participant’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this Award. Participant may make a beneficiary designation for this Award at any time by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator or its designee. 

^Cessation of Service. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5 below, should Participant cease Service for any reason prior to vesting in one or more Shares subject to this Award, then the Award will be immediately cancelled with respect to those unvested Shares, and the number of Restricted Stock Units will be reduced accordingly. Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled units. 

^Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents 

^^The holder of this Award shall not have any stockholder rights, including voting or dividend rights, with respect to the Shares subject to the Award until Participant becomes the record holder of those Shares following their actual issuance upon the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any stock dividend, whether regular or extraordinary, be declared and paid on the outstanding Common Stock while one or more Shares remain subject to this Award (i.e., those Shares are not otherwise issued and outstanding for purposes of entitlement to the dividend or distribution), then Participant shall automatically be credited with an additional number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the number of shares of Common Stock which would have been paid on the Shares (plus the number of additional shares previously credited to Participant pursuant to the dividend equivalent right provisions of this Paragraph 4) at the time subject to this Award had those Shares been actually issued and outstanding and entitled to that dividend. The additional Restricted Stock Units so credited shall vest at the same time as the Shares to which they relate and shall be distributed to Participant concurrently with the issuance of those Shares on the applicable Issue Date. However, each such distribution shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of the Withholding Taxes applicable to that distribution. 

^^Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any cash dividend, whether regular or extraordinary, be declared and paid on the outstanding Common Stock while one or more Shares remain subject to this Award (i.e., those Shares are not otherwise issued and outstanding for purposes of entitlement to the dividend or distribution), then a special book account shall be established for Participant and credited with a dollar amount equal to the amount of that dividend paid per share multiplied by the number of Restricted Stock Units at the time subject to this Award (plus the number of additional shares previously credited to Participant pursuant to the dividend equivalent right provisions of this Paragraph 4) as of the record date for the dividend. As of the first business day in January each year, the cash dividend amounts credited to the special book account during the immediately preceding calendar year shall be converted into a book entry of an additional number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) those cash dividend equivalent amounts by (ii) the average of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on each of the dates in the immediately preceding calendar year on which those dividends on the outstanding Common Stock were paid. The additional Restricted Stock Units so credited shall vest at the same time as the Shares to which they relate and shall be distributed to Participant concurrently with the issuance of those Shares on the applicable Issue Date. However, each such distribution shall be subject to the Corporation’s collection of the Withholding Taxes applicable to that distribution. 

^Accelerated Vesting/Change in Control. 

^^Should Participant’s Service terminate by reason of his or her Retirement, death or Permanent Disability prior to the scheduled vesting date for the Shares set forth in Paragraph 1, then Participant shall immediately vest in the number of Shares in which Participant would have been vested at the time of such termination had the Shares subject to this Award vested in a series of thirty-six (36) successive equal monthly installments over the duration of the three (3)-year vesting schedule set forth in Paragraph 1. 

^^Any Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award at the time of a Change in Control may be assumed by the successor entity or otherwise continued in full force and effect or may be replaced with a cash retention program of the successor entity which preserves the Fair Market Value of the unvested shares of Common Stock subject to the Award at the time of the Change in Control and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same (or more favorable) vesting schedule in effect for the Award at the time of such Change in Control. In the event of such assumption or continuation of the Award or such replacement of the Award with a cash retention program, no accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall occur at the time of the Change in Control. 

^^In the event the Award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect, the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award shall be adjusted immediately after the consummation of the Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which the Shares subject to those units immediately prior to the Change in Control would have been converted in consummation of that Change in Control had those Shares actually been issued and outstanding at that time. To the extent the actual holders of the outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation (or parent entity) may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award at that time, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control transaction, provided such common stock is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities exchange or market. 

^^If the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award at the time of the Change in Control are not assumed or otherwise continued in effect or replaced with a cash retention program in accordance with Paragraph 5(a), then those units will vest immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control. The Shares subject to those vested units, together with any other Shares in which Participant is at that time vested, will be issued on the Issue Date triggered by the Change in Control (or otherwise converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Common Stock payable to the other stockholders of the Corporation in consummation of that Change in Control and distributed at the same time as such stockholder payments), subject to the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7. 

^^Upon an involuntary termination of Participant’s Service for reasons other than Misconduct within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control transaction which does not otherwise result in the accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (d) of this Paragraph 5, all unvested Restricted Stock Units hereunder shall immediately vest at that time. Any unvested cash account maintained on Participant’s behalf pursuant to the cash retention program established in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 5 shall also vest at the time of such involuntary termination and shall be paid to Participant promptly thereafter. 

^^This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 

^Adjustment in Shares. In the event of any of the following transactions affecting the outstanding shares of Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration: any stock split, stock dividend, spin-off transaction, extraordinary distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property), recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other similar transaction affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation’s receipt of consideration or in the event of a substantial reduction to the value of the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of a spin-off transaction or extraordinary distribution, then equitable adjustments shall be made to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award in such manner as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate in order to reflect such change and thereby prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder. In determining such adjustments, the Plan Administrator shall take into account any amounts credited to Participant pursuant to the dividend equivalent right provisions of Paragraph 4 in connection with such transaction, and the determination of the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

^Collection of Withholding Taxes. 

^^Upon the applicable Issue Date, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of Participant a certificate (which may be in electronic form) for the applicable number of underlying shares of Common Stock, subject, however, to the Corporation’s collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. 

^^Until such time as the Corporation provides Participant with written or electronic notice to the contrary, the Corporation shall collect Withholding Taxes required to be withheld with respect to the issuance of the vested Shares hereunder (including shares attributable to the dividend equivalent rights provided under Paragraph 4) through an automatic share withholding procedure pursuant to which the Corporation will withhold, at the time of such issuance, a portion of the Shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the issuance date) equal to the amount of those taxes (the “Share Withholding Method”); provided, however, that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Corporation’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. Participant shall be notified in writing or electronically in the event such Share Withholding Method is no longer available. 

^^Should any Shares (including shares attributable to the dividend equivalent rights provided under Paragraph 4) be distributed at a time when the Share Withholding Method is not available, then the Withholding Taxes required to be withheld with respect to those Shares shall be collected from Participant through either of the following alternatives: 

      Participant’s delivery of his or her separate check payable to the Corporation in the amount of such taxes, or

      the use of the proceeds from a next-day sale of the Shares issued to Participant, provided and only if (i) such a sale is permissible under the Corporation’s trading policies governing the sale of Common Stock, (ii) Participant makes an irrevocable commitment, on or before the Issue Date for those Shares, to effect such sale of the Shares and (iii) the transaction is not otherwise deemed to constitute a prohibited loan under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph 7, the employee portion of the federal, state and local employment taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation in connection with the vesting of the Shares (the “Employment Taxes”) shall in all events be collected from Participant no later than the last business day of the calendar year in which the Shares vest hereunder. Accordingly, to the extent the Issue Date for one or more vested Shares (including shares attributable to the dividend equivalent rights provided under Paragraph 4) is to occur in a year subsequent to the calendar year in which those Shares vest, Participant shall, on or before the last business day of the calendar year in which the Shares vest, deliver to the Corporation a check payable to its order in the dollar amount equal to the Employment Taxes required to be withheld with respect to those Shares. 

^^Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 5(b) the settlement of all Restricted Stock Units which vest under the Award shall be made solely in shares of Common Stock. In no event, however, shall any fractional shares be issued. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Award shall, to the extent necessary, be rounded down to the next whole share in order to avoid the issuance of a fractional share. 

^Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Award shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Participant with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such issuance. 

^Additional Conditions. 

^^The Corporation may cancel this Award, and Participant shall cease to have any further right to the underlying Shares, at any time Participant is not in compliance with this Agreement, the Plan and the following conditions: 

^^^Participant shall not render services for any organization or engage, directly or indirectly, in any business which, in the judgment of the Plan Administrator or, if delegated by the Plan Administrator to the Chief Executive Officer, in the judgment of such officer, is or becomes competitive with the Corporation or any Affiliate, or which is or becomes otherwise prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Corporation or any Affiliate. Such judgment shall be based on Participant’s positions and responsibilities while employed by the Corporation or an Affiliate, Participant’s post-Service responsibilities and position with the other organization or business, the extent of past, current and potential competition or conflict between the Corporation or an Affiliate and the other organization or business, the effect on customers, suppliers and competitors of Participant’s assuming the post-Service position and such other considerations as are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and circumstances. Participant shall be free, however, to purchase as an investment or otherwise, stock or other securities of such organization or business so long as they are listed upon a recognized securities exchange or traded over the counter, and such investment does not represent a substantial investment to Participant or a greater than one percent ([[Percentage 1: Number]]%) equity interest in the organization or business. 

^^^Participant shall not, without prior written authorization from the Corporation, disclose to anyone outside the Corporation, or use in other than the Corporation’s business, any secret or confidential information, knowledge or data, relating to the business of the Corporation or an Affiliate in violation of his or her agreement with the Corporation or the Affiliate. 

^^^Participant shall disclose promptly and assign to the Corporation or the Affiliate all right, title and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by Participant during employment by the Corporation or the Affiliate, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business, research or development work of the Corporation or the Affiliate and shall do anything reasonably necessary to enable the Corporation or the Affiliate to secure a patent where appropriate in the United States and in foreign countries. 

^^^Participant shall not in any way, directly or indirectly (a) induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Corporation to quit employment with the Corporation; (b) otherwise interfere with or disrupt the Corporation’s relationship with its employees; (c) solicit, entice, or hire away any employee of the Corporation; or (d) hire or engage any employee of the Corporation or any former employee of the Company whose employment with the Corporation ceased less than one (1) year before the date of such hiring or engagement. 

^^^Participant will not divert or attempt to divert from the Corporation any business the Corporation had enjoyed or solicited from its customers during the two (2) years prior to the diversion or attempted diversion of such business. 

^^^Participant shall not make any disparaging statements about the Corporation to any of the Corporation’s past, present, or future customers, employees, clients, contractors, vendors, or to the media or to any other person either orally or by any other medium of communication, including internet communication. As used herein, the term “disparaging statement” means any communication, oral or written, which would cause or tend to cause humiliation or embarrassment or to cause a recipient of such communication to question the business condition, integrity, product, service, quality, confidence, or good character of the Corporation. 

^^Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may cancel this Award at any time prior to the issuance of the Shares, if the employment of Participant shall be terminated, other than by reason of death, unless the conditions in this Section 9 are met. 

^^Failure to comply with the conditions of this Section 9 prior to, or during the six months after, any payment or delivery pursuant to this Award shall cause the issuance of the Shares to be rescinded. The Corporation shall notify Participant in writing of any such rescission within two (2) years after delivery of the Shares, and within ten (10) days after receiving such notice, Participant shall either return the delivered Shares to the Corporation or pay to the Corporation the amount of the proceeds recognized upon any sale or other disposition of those Shares. 

^^Upon delivery of the Shares pursuant to this Award, the Plan Administrator may require Participant to certify on a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator, that Participant is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. 

^Notices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Corporation under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at its principal corporate office at 436 Seventh Avenue, [[Address 1: Address]]. Except to the extent electronic notice is expressly authorized hereunder, any notice required to be given or delivered to Participant shall be in writing and addressed to Participant at the address indicated below Participant’s signature line on this Agreement. All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery (or electronic delivery to the extent authorized hereunder) or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 

^Successors and Assigns. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Corporation and its successors and assigns and Participant, Participant’s assigns, the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of Participant’s estate and any beneficiaries of the Award designated by Participant. 

^Construction. This Agreement and the Award evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan. All decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in the Award. 

^Governing Law. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without resort to Pennsylvania’s conflict-of-laws rules. 

^Employment at Will. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon Participant any right to continue in Service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Participant) or of Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate Participant’s Service at any time for any reason, with or without cause, unless such rights have otherwise been limited pursuant to a separate agreement between the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary) and Participant.
