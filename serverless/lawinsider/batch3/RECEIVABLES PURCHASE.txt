Such “authoritative copy” of each Receivable in the form of electronic chattel paper consists of a copy or image stored in an electronic medium of the original executed copy of the Receivable in the form of tangible chattel paper that had been executed by the related Obligor, that had been delivered to [[Organization 3 Name]] before conversion to an electronic record, and that identifies [[Organization 3 Name]] as the secured party under s uch Receivable or as the assignee of the secured party under such Receivable.

The Purchaser or the Seller, or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, shall inform the other party promptly, in writing, upon discovery of any breach of the Seller’s representations and warranties pursuant to this Section which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser (or any assignee thereof) in any Receivable.

^^Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The Seller hereby makes the perfection representations, warranties and covenants set forth on Schedule I hereto to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be deemed to have relied on such representations, warranties and covenants in acquiring the Receivables.

^Repurchase of Receivables. In the event of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 2.03(a) which materially and adversely affects the interest of the Purchaser (or any assignee thereof) in any Receivable, unless such breach shall have been cured in all material respects, the Seller shall repurchase such Receivable by the last day of the second Collection Period following the Collection Period in which the discovery of the breach is made or notice is received, as the case may be (or, at the option of the Seller, the last day in the first Collection Period following the Collection Period in which such discovery is made or such notice received). This repurchase obligation shall obtain for all representations and warranties of the Seller contained in Section 2.03(a) of this Agreement whether or not the Seller has knowledge of the breach at the time of the breach or at the time the repr esentations and warranties were made. In consideration of the purchase of any such Receivable, the Seller shall remit an amount equal to the Warranty Purchase Payment in respect of such Receivable to the Purchaser. Except as described below, the sole remedy of the Purchaser (or any assignee thereof) with respect to a breach of the Seller’s representations and warranties pursuant to this Agreement shall be to require the Seller to repurchase the related Receivable pursuant to this Section. Upon any such repurchase, the Purchaser shall, without further action, be deemed to transfer, assign, set-over and otherwise convey to the Seller, without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the Purchaser in, to and under such repurchased Receivable, all monies due or to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof.

^^The Seller shall notify the Purchaser within 30 days after any relocation of its principal executive office or state of incorporation, if, as a result of such relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC as in effect in the applicable state would require the filing of any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation statement or of any new financing statement and shall promptly file such financing statements or amendments

^No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Purchaser, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Seller, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exhaustive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

^Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (and by different parties on separate counterparts), each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

^Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, each of which shall be considered to be a third-party beneficiary hereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no other Person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

^Merger and Integration.

^Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages, injury and liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arose out of, and was imposed upon such Person through the willful misconduct or negligence of the Seller in the performance of its duties under this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any judgment, award, settlement, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that the Seller shall not indemnify any such Person if such acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions constitute negligence or willful misconduct by the Purchaser. In case any such action is brought against a party indemnified under this Section 5.13 and it notifies the Seller of the commencement thereof, the Seller will assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who may, unless there is, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel stating that there is an unwaivable conflict of interest, be counsel to the Seller), and the Seller will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation.

^Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of, the Seller. 

^^The Seller shall not consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:

^^^the corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Seller is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer the properties and assets of the Seller substantially as an entirety shall be organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any State or the District of Columbia, and, if the Seller is not the surviving entity, shall expressly assume, by an agreement supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Purchaser, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, the performance of every covenant and obligation of the Seller hereunder and shall benefit from all the rights granted to the Seller hereunder in all material respects; and
