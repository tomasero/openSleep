All capitalized terms and conditions herein have the definitions as provided in the Agreement or as otherwise indicated herein.

***WHEREAS***, according to the Lufthansa/Swiss Preferred Fare Program, EBOOKERS and EBOOKERS Locations in the applicable territories are obliged to bear certain costs (the “LH/Swiss Preferred Fare Surcharge”): 

***WHEREAS***, the Parties previously entered into an Amendment to the Agreement with an effective date of [[Date 2: Date]] regarding the LH/Swiss Fare Surcharge and other terms and conditions (the “LH/LX Amendment”) which was terminated for the Territory of Germany; 

***WHEREAS***, the Parties have agreed to a separate reimbursement process for the territory of Switzerland on base of the LH/LX Amendment, which reimbursement process will be unaffected by this Amendment;

^^The Parties agree that only the terms for handling the reimbursement in Germany shall apply. Other territories are out of scope and have to be agreed separately if applicable.

^**§ 2 Amount of reimbursement**

^^The first sentence of Article 2 of the LH/LX Amendment shall be replaced by the following sentence:

“Given its purely provisional and compensatory nature, the Amadeus ACO’s partial reimbursement of the LH/LX Preferred Surcharge of an amount of (***) per ticketed and charged segment is subject to the following conditions:”

^^The last sentence of Article 2 of the Amendment shall be replaced by the following sentence:

^^^^^ 
“In case of a Reduction, such affected EBOOKERS Locations (or EBOOKERS) shall inform Amadeus immediately.
