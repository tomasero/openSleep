Premises) on [[Date 12]]. **For all other such Alterations,** Tenant shall ascertain from Landlord within thirty (30) days before the end of the Term of this Lease whether Landlord desires to have the Premises or any part or parts thereof restored to their condition and configuration as when the Premises were delivered to Tenant and if Landlord shall so desire, then at Tenant’s option, Tenant shall either (i) pay to Landlord a fee in an amount equal to (a) Landlord’s estimated cost to the average of two (2) estimates received by Landlord to perform such removal work required to restore the Premises to the configuration as shown on Exhibit B attached hereto that existed on [[Date 12]] after bidding such work to at least two (2) contractors; however Landlord shall not obtain the estimates until Tenant has notified Landlord that it wants to pay the fee versus doing the work itself, or (ii) Tenant shall restore said Premises or such part or parts thereof before the end of this Lease at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. In the event Tenant elects to pay for the cost of the restoration, the fee shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord regardless of whether or not Landlord elects to restore all or part of said Premises. In the event Tenant is required to complete the restoration and said restoration is not completed prior to the Termination Date, Tenant acknowledges that Tenant shall enter into a Hold Over period pursuant to the terms of Lease Paragraph 25 (“Holding Over”) and Tenant shall automatically be liable to Landlord for the monthly Hold Over Basic Rent and all other Additional Rent until said restoration is completed by Tenant. Tenant, on or before the end of the Term or sooner termination of this Lease, shall remove all of Tenant’s personal property and trade fixtures from the Premises, and all property not so removed on or before the end of the Term or sooner termination of this Lease shall be deemed abandoned by Tenant and title to same shall thereupon pass to Landlord without compensation to Tenant. Landlord may, upon termination of this Lease, remove all moveable furniture and equipment so abandoned by Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost, and repair any damage caused by such removal at Tenant’s sole cost. Upon surrender of the Premises to Landlord, Tenant shall provide Landlord with keys for all exterior and interior locking doors (including mechanical rooms). If the Premises is not surrendered at the end of the Term or sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against loss or liability resulting from the delay by Tenant in so surrendering the Premises including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding Tenant founded on such delay. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as an extension of the Term hereof or as a consent of Landlord to any holding over by Tenant. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease or the Premises by Tenant or a mutual cancellation of this Lease shall not work as a merger and, at the option of Landlord, shall either terminate all or any existing subleases or subtenancies or operate as an assignment to Landlord of all or any such subleases or subtenancies.

Landlord acknowledges that Tenant may use electrical current up to 220 Volts subject to the terms and conditions of this Paragraph. If (i) Tenant shall require water, gas, or electric current in excess of that usually furnished or supplied to Premises being used as general office space, Tenant shall first obtain the written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) if Tenant is found to be using water, gas and/or electrical current in excess of its Proportionate Share (as such excess usage is confirmed by a study conducted by Landlord’s contractor(s) and/or licensed electrician(s), Landlord may (a) adjust the Proportionate Share allocated to Tenant based on Tenant’s actual or estimated use or (b) cause an electric current, gas or water meter to be installed in the Premises in order to measure the amount of electric current, gas or water consumed for any such excess use.

Except as noted above, Landlord agrees that the Amortized Cost of capital improvements which are not necessitated by Tenant’s particular use, but are necessitated by any new laws, statutes, ordinances or governmental rules, regulations, or requirements that become effective after the Lease Commencement Date will be amortized over the useful life of such improvement, and Tenant shall be required to pay its Proportionate Share of the Amortized Cost over (a) the remaining term of the Lease and Tenant shall pay its Proportionate Share of said Amortized Cost monthly over the term then remaining in the Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Tenant will immediately pay one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the cost of required capital improvements related to Tenant’s particular use of the Premises and resulting from (i) and/or (ii) above.

In the event the Term of the Lease is extended for any reason whatsoever, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the earlier Amortized Cost shall be increased to include the additional amount payable to Landlord due to the Extended Term of the Lease.

^ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING: Effective [[Date 12]] Lease Paragraphs 16 and 42 (“Assignment and Subletting”) is hereby amended to reflect that Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent (i) from [[Date 12]] through [[Date 37: Date]], one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of all Basic Rents and/or consideration due Tenant from its assignees, transferees, or subtenants in excess of the Basic Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder for the assigned, transferred and/or subleased space (“Excess Rent”) and (ii) fifty percent ([[Percentage 3: Number]]%) of the Excess Rent from [[Date 19]] through the remaining term of the Lease.

The amortization period shall be ten (10) years and commences on [[Date 12]]. Following Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s election to terminate the Lease as provided in

Initial:   JDK![](g93411ks03i001.jpg)

Paragraph 18, Tenant agrees to pay the Termination Feeto Landlord within ten (10) days following Tenant’s receipt of an invoice from Landlord reflecting the amount due. For example: if Tenant elects to terminate the Lease on [[Date 39: Date]] and if Tenant uses one hundred percent ([[Percentage 1]]%) of the Interior Improvement Allowance of $[[USD Value 37]], Tenant would be responsible for paying a Termination Fee equal to $[[USD Value 39: Number]] which includes the following unamortized then remaining balances: (i) $[[USD Value 40: Number]] brokerage fee ($[[USD Value 38]] / 10 years / 12 months = $[[USD Value 41: Number]] x 36 months), (ii) $[[USD Value 42: Number]] Interior Improvement Allowance ($[[USD Value 37]] / 10 years / 12 months = $[[USD Value 43: Number]] x 36 months) and (iii) $[[USD Value 44: Number]] Deferred Basic Rent ($[[USD Value 9]] / 10 years / 12 months = $[[USD Value 10]] x 36 months).

^*. Personal Nature of Option to Terminate.* The Option rights of Tenant under this Paragraph 18 are granted for Tenant’s personal benefit and may not be assigned or transferred by Tenant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, in any manner whatsoever, other than in connection with a Permitted Transfer. In the event that the Lease is assigned (other than in connection with a Permitted Transfer), the Option granted herein shall be void and of no force and effect.

^OPTION TO EXTEND LEASE FOR FIVE (5) YEARS: Provided said Lease is not terminated prior to the scheduled Termination Date and provided Tenant has not assigned the Lease or subleased more than fifty percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of the Premises (other than in connection with a Permitted Transfer) at the time said “Option to Extend” (as herein called) is exercised, Landlord hereby grants to Tenant an Option to Extend this Lease Agreement for an additional five (5) year period (“Extended Term”) upon the following terms and conditions:

^*Notice; Deadline.* Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of Tenant’s exercise of this Option to Extend not earlier than nine (9) months prior to the scheduled Lease Termination Date, in which event the Lease shall be considered extended for an additional five (5) years with: (i) the Basic Rent to be determined pursuant to Paragraph 19.B below; and (ii) this Paragraph 19 deleted. In the event that Tenant fails to timely exercise Tenant’s Option to Extend as set forth herein in writing, Tenant shall have no further Option to Extend this Lease, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect for the full remaining Term hereof, absent this Paragraph 19.

^*Notice and Acceptance of Terms.* In the event Tenant timely exercises Tenant’s Option to Extend as set forth herein, Landlord shall, within ten (10) business days after receipt of Tenant’s exercise of its Option to Extend, advise Tenant of the Basic Rent required for the Extended Term of the Lease. Said Basic Rent shall be equal to the then current market per square foot rate for similar quality buildings in the vicinity of the Premises of equivalent quality, size, utility and location (the “Market Basic Rent Rate”). Tenant shall have ten (10) business days after receipt from Landlord of the proposed Basic Rent in which to reject said proposed Basic Rent. Tenant’s failure to timely reject the proposed Basic Rent shall be deemed as Tenant’s acceptance of such proposed Basic Rent and Tenant shall enter into written documentation confirming same. If Tenant timely rejects the proposed Basic Rent, then Landlord and Tenant shall then negotiate in good faith to agree to the Basic Rent for a period of five (5) business days following such rejection notice from Tenant. In the event Landlord and Tenant fail to agree to the Basic Rent within such five (5) business day period (the “Outside Agreement Date”), then Landlord and Tenant shall each make a separate determination of the Market Basic Rent Rate which shall be submitted to each other and to arbitration in accordance with the following items (i) through (vii):

Initial:   JDK![](g93411ks03i001.jpg)

^^^Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint, within ten (10) days of the Outside Agreement Date, one arbitrator who shall by profession be a certified MAI designated appraiser licensed to practice in California with at least five (5) years experience in the appraisal of properties in the vicinity of the Premises. The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Market Basic Rent Rate is the closest to the actual Market Basic Rent Rate as determined by the arbitrators; provided, however, the arbitrators may only select Landlord’s or Tenant’s determination of Market Basic Rent Rate and shall not be entitled to make a compromise determination.

^^^The two arbitrators so appointed shall within five (5) business days of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two arbitrators.

^^^The three arbitrators shall within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator reach a decision as to whether the parties shall use Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Market Basic Rent Rate, and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof.

^^^The decision of the majority of the three arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.

^^^If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an arbitrator within ten (10) days after the applicable Outside Agreement Date, the arbitrator appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify Landlord and Tenant thereof, and such arbitrator’s decision shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.

^^^If the two arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, or both parties fail to appoint an arbitrator, then the appointment of the third arbitrator or any arbitrator shall be dismissed and the matter to be decided shall be forthwith submitted to arbitration under the provisions of the American Arbitration Association.

^^^The cost of arbitration shall be paid by Landlord and Tenant equally.

^Personal Nature of Option to Extend. The option rights of Tenant under this Paragraph 19, and the Extended Term thereunder, are granted for Tenant’s personal benefit and may not be assigned or transferred by Tenant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, in any manner whatsoever except in connection with a Permitted Transfer. In the event that Landlord consents to a sublease of more than fifty percent ([[Percentage 3]]%) of the Premises or assignment under Lease Paragraphs 16 and 42 (other than a Permitted Transfer), the option granted herein and any Extended Term thereunder shall at Landlord’s option be void and of no force and effect (without notice from Landlord), whether or not Tenant shall have purported to exercise such option prior to such assignment or sublease, and this Lease will continue in full force and effect for the full remaining Term hereof, absent of this Paragraph 19.

^Loss of Option to Extend Right. It is agreed that if Tenant is at the time it exercises its 

Initial:   JDK![](g93411ks03i001.jpg)

Option to Extend in monetary default of this Lease or in a material non-monetary default as provided for in Lease Paragraphs 19 and 43 (“Bankruptcy and Default”) and has failed to cure the default in the cure period provided for under this Lease following Tenant’s receipt of notice from Landlord, this Option to Extend is automatically forfeited by Tenant (without notice from Landlord). In the event said Option to Extend is forfeited as stated herein, Tenant shall have no further Option to Extend this Lease. It is further agreed that if Tenant has exercised its Option to Extend and is subsequently in default prior to, or at any time prior to the commencement of the Extended Term and has failed to cure the (a) monetary default within five (5) days from the date of written notice from Landlord, or (b) material non-monetary default within the cure period provided for under this Lease, Landlord may at its sole and absolute discretion, cancel and rescind Tenant’s Option to Extend, and, unless said Lease is also terminated due to said uncured default, this Lease will continue in full force and effect for the full remaining Term hereof, absent of this Paragraph 19.

^REPLACEMENT OF LEASE PARAGRAPH 12 (“PROPERTY INSURANCE”): Said Lease Paragraph 12 (“Property Insurance”) is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

“12. PROPERTY INSURANCE.

Tenant shall have no interest in or any right to the proceeds of any insurance procured by Landlord for the Premises.

In addition and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 12, each party to this Lease hereby waives all rights of recovery against the other party or its officers, employees, agents and representatives for loss or damage to its property or the property of others under its control, arising from any cause insured against under the fire and extended “special form” property coverage (excluding, however, any loss resulting from Hazardous Material contamination of the Property) required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease to the extent full reimbursement of the loss/claim is received by the insured party. Each party required to carry property insurance hereunder shall cause the policy evidencing such insurance to include a provision permitting such release of liability (“waiver of subrogation endorsement”). If such waiver is so prohibited, the insured party affected shall promptly notify the other party thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing waiver of subrogation shall not include any loss resulting from Hazardous Material contamination of the Property or any insurance coverage relating thereto.”

^DESTRUCTION: Lease Paragraph 21 (“Destruction”) is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

“In the event the Premises are destroyed in whole or in part from any cause, Landlord may, at its option:

^^Rebuild or restore the Premises to their condition prior to the damage or destruction, or

^^Terminate this Lease (providing that the Premises is damaged to the extent of thirty-three and one third percent (33 1/[[Percentage 4: Number]]%) or more of the replacement cost, exclusive of footings, foundations and floor slabs).

If Landlord does not give Tenant notice in writing within thirty (30) days from the destruction of the Premises of its election to either rebuild and restore the Premises, or to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall be deemed to have elected to rebuild or restore the Premises, in which event Landlord agrees, at its expense except for any deductible, which is the responsibility of the Tenant, promptly to rebuild or restore the Premises to the condition existing prior to the damage or destruction. Tenant shall be entitled to a reduction in Rent from the date of such damage or destruction, provided Tenant is not using any portion of such damaged area, while such repair is being made in the proportion that the area of the Premises rendered untenantable by such damage bears to the total area of the Leased Premises. If Landlord initially estimates that the rebuilding or restoration will exceed one hundred eighty (180) days or if Landlord does not complete the rebuilding or restoration within one hundred eighty (180) days following the commencement date of construction (such period of time to be extended for delays caused by the fault or neglect of Tenant or because of Acts of God, acts of public agencies, labor disputes, strikes, fires, freight embargos, rainy or stormy weather, inability to obtain materials, supplies or fuels, acts of contractors or subcontractors, or delay of the contractors or subcontractors due to such causes or other contingencies beyond the control of Landlord) (the “Allowed Restoration Period”), and provided the damage or destruction does not result from intentional damage or destruction caused by Tenant, its officers, employees, agents, contractors and/or representatives, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Landlord within five (5) business days following the date Tenant receives Landlord’s written notice stating that the restoration will exceed the Allowed Restoration Period. During the period the Landlord named in this Amendment No. 1 or any of its affiliates owns the Building and Tenant elects to terminate this Lease early pursuant to the terms of this Paragraph 21.(b), Tenant shall remain liable for its Proportionate Share of the insurance deductible as it relates to the Premises. Subject to the terms of this Paragraph 21, Tenant shall not be liable for its Proportionate Share of the insurance deductible if Landlord terminates the Lease pursuant to this Paragraph 21 or Tenant terminates the Lease pursuant to this Paragraph 21 provided neither the Landlord named in Amendment No. 1 nor any of its affiliates owns the Building at the time the damage to the Building occurs that results in the right of either party to terminate the Lease. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord’s obligation to rebuild or restore shall be limited to the Building and interior

Initial:   JDK![](g93411ks05i001.jpg) improvements constructed by Landlord as they existed on the later of (a) the Commencement Date of the Lease or (b) [[Date 11]] and shall not include restoration of Tenant’s trade fixtures, equipment, merchandise, or any improvements, alterations or additions made by Tenant to the Premises, which Tenant shall forthwith replace or fully repair at Tenant’s sole cost and expense provided this Lease is not terminated according to the provisions above.

Unless this Lease is terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. Tenant hereby expressly waives the provision of Section 1932, Subdivision 2, in Section 1933, Subdivision 4 of the California Civil Code.

In any event that the Building in which the Premises are situated is damaged or destroyed to the extent of not less than thirty-three and one third percent (33 1/[[Percentage 4]]%) of the replacement cost thereof, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease, whether the Premises be injured or not. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Landlord may terminate this Lease in the event of an uninsured event or if insurance proceeds are insufficient to cover one hundred percent of the rebuilding costs net of the deductible.”

^CHOICE OF LAW/VENUE; SEVERABILITY: This Amendment shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the County of Alameda in the State of California and each party specifically stipulates to venue in Alameda County. If any provisions of this Amendment shall be invalid, unenforceable, or ineffective for any reason whatsoever, all other provisions hereof shall be and remain in full force and effect.

^AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE: The parties executing this Amendment hereby warrant and represent that they are properly authorized to execute this Amendment and that the individuals executing this Lease are authorized to bind the parties on behalf of whom they execute this Amendment and to all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Amendment as they relate to the respective parties hereto.

^EXAMINATION OF AMENDMENT: This Amendment No. 1 shall not be effective until its execution by both Landlord and Tenant.

EXCEPT AS MODIFIED HEREIN, all other terms, covenants, and conditions of the Lease shall remain in full force and effect.
