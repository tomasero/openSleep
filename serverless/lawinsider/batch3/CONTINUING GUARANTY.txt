\centered **CONTINUING GUARANTY** 

THIS CONTINUING GUARANTY is made as of the [[Date 1: Date]] by **[[Organization 1 Name]]**, a Delaware corporation (the “Guarantor”), in favor of **[[Organization 2 Name]], N.A.**, a national banking association having an office at 777 Main Street, [[Address 1: Address]], as Administrative Agent (together with any successor thereto appointed pursuant to Section 9.06 of the Credit Agreement referred to below, “Agent”) for itself and the other Lenders (defined below) which are or may become parties to the Credit Agreement referred to below. 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and in consideration of credit and/or financial accommodation heretofore or hereafter from time to time made or granted to HIGHER ONE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), by each lending institution from time to time a “lender” (collectively, the “Lenders”) under that certain Credit Agreement of even date herewith (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”; capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement) by and among [[Party 1]], the Guarantor hereby furnishes its guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations (as hereinafter defined) as follows: 

^Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of every kind, nature and character, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, voluntary or involuntary and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Borrower to the Lenders arising under the Credit Agreement and any instruments, agreements or other documents of any kind or nature now or hereafter executed in connection with the Credit Agreement (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the Lenders in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof), and whether recovery upon such indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against the Guarantor or any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code), any successor statute or any other liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, moratorium, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, or similar debtor relief laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions from time to time in effect and affecting the rights of creditors generally (collectively, “Debtor Relief Laws”), and including interest that accrues after the commencement by or against the Borrower of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws (collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Agent’s and the Lenders’ books and records showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantor and, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations. This 

Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 

^No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments. The Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United States of America. The Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless the Guarantor is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation (other than one arising with respect to taxes based on or measured by the income or profits of the Lenders) is imposed upon the Guarantor with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder, the Guarantor will pay to the Agent (on behalf of the Lenders), on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder, such additional amount in U.S. dollars as shall be necessary to enable the Lenders to receive the same net amount which the Lenders would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed upon the Guarantor. The Guarantor will deliver promptly to the Lenders certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Guarantor hereunder. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty. 

^Rights of Lender. The Guarantor consents and agrees that the Agent, on behalf of the Lender may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Agent, on behalf of Lenders, in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Guarantor. 

^Certain Waivers. The Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Agent on behalf of the Lenders or any Lender) of the liability of the Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require the Agent to proceed against the Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the 

Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in the Agent’s or any Lender’s power whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Agent or any Lender; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. The Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. 

^Obligations Independent. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 

^Subrogation. The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any Commitments with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Agent, for the Lenders, and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 

^Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and any commitments of the Lenders or facilities provided by the Lenders with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or the Guarantor is made, or the Agent on behalf of any of the Lenders exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Agent or any Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Agent is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 

^Subordination. The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Borrower owing to the Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Borrower to the Guarantor as subrogee of the Agent or resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations. If the Agent on behalf of the Lenders or any Lender so requests, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Agent and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty. 

^Stay of Acceleration. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders. 

^Expenses. The Guarantor shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses and the allocated cost and disbursements of internal legal counsel) in any way relating to the enforcement or protection of the Agent’s and the Lenders’ rights under this Guaranty or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any incurred during any “workout” or restructuring in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any incurred in the preservation, protection or enforcement of any rights of the Lender in any proceeding any Debtor Relief Laws. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty. 

^Miscellaneous. No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, and the Guarantor. No failure by the Agent or the Lenders to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. Unless otherwise agreed by the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, and the Guarantor in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders or any term or provision thereof. 

^Condition of Borrower. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as the Guarantor requires, and that the Agent has no duty, and the Guarantor is not relying on the Agent at any time, to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Agent to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same). 

^Setoff. If and to the extent any payment is not made when due hereunder, the Guarantor hereby grants to the Agent and the Lenders a continuing lien, security interest and right of setoff as security for the Guaranteed Obligations and any and all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of Guarantor under the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, whether now existing or hereafter arising, upon and against all its deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or hereafter in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of the Agent, any Lender or any entity under common control of [[Organization 2 Name]] and its successors and assigns or in transit to any of them. 

^Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) it is duly organized and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has full capacity and right to make and perform this Guaranty, and all necessary authority has been obtained; (b) this Guaranty constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms; (c) the making and performance of this Guaranty does not and will not violate the provisions of any applicable law, regulation or order, and does not and will not result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require any consent under, any material agreement, instrument, or document to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property may be bound or affected; and (d) all consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations of, and filings and registrations with, any governmental authority required under applicable law and regulations for the making and performance of this Guaranty have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect. 

^Indemnification and Survival. Without limitation on any other obligations of the Guarantor or remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under this Guaranty, the Guarantor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless the Agent and the Lenders from and against, and shall pay on demand, any and all damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and the allocated cost and disbursements of internal legal counsel) that may be suffered or incurred by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with or as a result of any failure of any Guaranteed Obligations to be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.

This Guaranty shall (a) bind the Guarantor and its successors and assigns, provided that the Guarantor may not assign its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of the Agent on behalf of the Lenders (and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void), and (b) inure to the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns and the Agent and the Lenders may, without notice to the Guarantor and without affecting the Guarantor’s obligations hereunder, assign, sell or grant participations in the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty, in whole or in part. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States Federal or State court sitting in [[Address 2: Address]] any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, and (ii) waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any defense asserting an inconvenient forum in connection therewith. Service of process by the Agent or any Lender in connection with such action or proceeding shall be binding on the Guarantor if sent to the Guarantor by registered or certified mail at its address specified below or such other address as from time to time notified by the Guarantor. The Guarantor agrees that the Agent and the Lenders may disclose to any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations any and all information in the Agents, and the Lenders’ possession concerning the Guarantor, this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty.

^COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION. TO INDUCE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF FO THE LENDERS, TO ENTER INTO THE TRANSACTIONS EVIDENCED BY THE NOTE AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE GUARANTOR AGREES THAT THESE ARE COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND NOT CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO NOTICE AND A HEARING UNDER CHAPTER 903a OF THE CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUTES, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER ANY OTHER FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTE OR STATUTES OR FOREIGN LAWS AFFECTING PREJUDGMENT REMEDIES, AND AUTHORIZES AGENT’S ATTORNEY TO ISSUE A WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER, PROVIDED THE COMPLAINT SHALL SET FORTH A COPY OF THIS WAIVER, AND WAIVE ANY CLAIM IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE AGAINST AGENT’S ATTORNEY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF SUCH ISSUANCE OF A WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WITHOUT COURT ORDER. FURTHER, IN THE EVENT AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, SEEKS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ANY OR ALL OF GUARANTOR’S PROPERTY OR OTHER ASSETS BY COURT PROCESS OR OTHER METHOD AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAW, THE GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY BOND AND ANY SURETY OR SECURITY RELATING THERETO REQUIRED BY ANY STATUTE, COURT RULE OR OTHERWISE AS AN INCIDENT TO SUCH POSSESSION, AND WAIVES ANY DEMAND FOR POSSESSION PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANY SUIT OR ACTION TO RECOVER WITH RESPECT THERETO. SPECIFICALLY, THE GUARANTOR RECOGNIZES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THE EXERCISE BY AGENT OF THE RIGHTS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY RESULT IN THE ATTACHMENT OF OR LEVY AGAINST SUCH GUARANTOR’S PROPERTY, AND SUCH WRIT FOR A PREJUDGMENT REMEDY WILL NOT HAVE THE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL OR SCRUTINY OF A COURT OF LAW OR OTHER JUDICIAL OFFICER AND THE GUARANTOR WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO ANY NOTICE OR PRIOR HEARING WHERE THE GUARANTOR MIGHT CONTEST SUCH A PROCEDURE.
