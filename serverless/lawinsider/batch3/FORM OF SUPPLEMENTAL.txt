The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that all Securities of this Series (but not less than all) issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities need not be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities of this Series in exchange for such Global Security, shall authenticate and deliver, individual Securities of this Series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security or Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
