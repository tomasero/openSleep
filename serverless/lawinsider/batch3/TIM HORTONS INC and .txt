\centered - and - 

**[[Organization 2 Name]] OF CANADA**, a trust company existing under the laws of Canada (the “**Trustee**”) 

**RECITALS:** 

^The Issuer and the Trustee have entered into a trust indenture dated as of [[Date 2]] (the “**Base Indenture**”).

^Pursuant to Section 2.2 and Section 14.1 of the Base Indenture, the Issuer may issue one or more series of senior unsecured notes containing such terms, provisions and conditions as may be set forth in a Supplemental Indenture pertaining to the notes of such series.

^By a supplemental indenture to the Base Indenture (the “**First Supplemental Indenture**”) between the Issuer and the Trustee dated as of [[Date 2]], a series of senior unsecured notes (the “**Series 1 Notes**”) was created, on the terms and with the characteristics provided for in the First Supplemental Indenture.

^The Issuer wishes to issue additional Series 1 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of Cdn.$[[USD Value 1]] and, for that purpose, to enter into this supplemental indenture (the “**Reopening Supplemental Indenture**”) to the Base Indenture as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture and the Reopening Supplemental Indenture, the “**Trust Indenture**”).

^This Reopening Supplemental Indenture is entered into for the purpose of providing for the issue of additional [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Unsecured Notes, Series 1, due [[Date 3]], in the aggregate principal amount of Cdn.$[[USD Value 1]] pursuant to the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, and establishing the terms, provisions and conditions of the Series 1 Notes to be issued under this Reopening Supplemental Indenture.

NOW THEREFORE THIS REOPENING SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITNESSES and it is hereby covenanted, agreed and declared as follows: 

\centered **INTERPRETATION** 

^**Definitions**

All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Reopening Supplemental Indenture shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Base Indenture, as such meanings may be amended by this Reopening Supplemental Indenture. The interpretation provisions specified in Article 1 of the Base Indenture apply to this Reopening Supplemental Indenture unless otherwise required by the context hereof. When entered into by the parties, this Reopening Supplemental Indenture shall be supplemental to, part of and read together with the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, as a single instrument, and all of the provisions of the Base Indenture, as supplemented by this Reopening Supplemental Indenture, shall apply to the Notes (as defined below). In the event of any inconsistency between the terms in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, and this Reopening Supplemental Indenture, the terms in this Reopening Supplemental Indenture shall prevail. 

In this Reopening Supplemental Indenture, except as otherwise defined herein or unless the context otherwise requires, the term “**Notes**” means the [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Unsecured Notes, Series 1, due [[Date 3]] issued under this Reopening Supplemental Indenture and the term “**Global Note**” means the Interim Global Certificate (as defined below) or the Permanent Global Certificate (as defined below), as the case may be. 

^**Reopening Supplemental Indenture**

The terms “**this Reopening Supplemental Indenture**”, “**this indenture**”, “**herein**”, “**hereof**”, “**hereby**”, “**hereunder**”, and similar expressions, unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, refer to the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, as amended and supplemented by this Reopening Supplemental Indenture and not to any particular Article, section, subsection or clause or other portion thereof, and include every instrument supplemental or ancillary to this Reopening Supplemental Indenture. This Reopening Supplemental Indenture is a Supplemental Indenture within the meaning of the Base Indenture. For clarity and avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Reopening Supplemental Indenture shall only be applicable to the Series 1 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of Cdn.$[[USD Value 1]] issued hereunder and shall not be applicable to any other notes hereafter issued. 

\centered **TERMS OF THE NOTES** 

^**Authorization**

Additional Series 1 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of Cdn.$[[USD Value 1]] are authorized for immediate issue, such that the aggregate principal amount of Series 1 Notes authorized for issue under the Trust Indenture as of the date hereof is Cdn. $[[USD Value 2: Number]] 

^**Attributes of Notes**

The Notes issued hereby are Series 1 Notes having the terms and attributes provided for in Section 2.3 of the First Supplemental Indenture, save and except that the Original Date of Issue for the Notes shall be [[Date 1]], with interest accruing on the Notes from [[Date 1]]. 

^**Creation and Issuance**

Notes in the aggregate principal amount of Cdn.$[[USD Value 1]] are hereby created and one or more Global Notes evidencing the Notes may forthwith and from time to time be executed by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee and shall thereupon be authenticated and delivered by either or both of them in the manner described in the Base Indenture. 

^**Incorporation by Reference**

The defined terms set out in Section 1.3 (Definitions), and the provisions of Section 2.5 (Location of Registers), Section 2.6 (Additional Amounts), Section 2.7 (Trustee, etc.), Section 2.8 (Redemption and Repurchase) and Article 3 (Offer to Repurchase Series 1 Notes) of the First Supplemental Indenture shall apply to the Notes and are incorporated by reference as if set out in full herein, and any reference to “this Supplemental Indenture” or “this First Supplemental Indenture” contained in Section 1.3, Section 2.6 or Article 3 of the First Supplemental Indenture and incorporated by reference herein shall be read as if it read “this Reopening Supplemental Indenture”. 

^**Issuance of Notes to Constitute Same Series**

Notwithstanding that the Original Date of Issue for the Notes shall be [[Date 1]], with interest accruing on the Notes from [[Date 1]], the Series 1 Notes issued hereunder shall constitute and be deemed to be the same Series (as defined in the Base Indenture) as the Series 1 Notes issued on [[Date 2]]. 

\centered **FORM OF NOTES** 

^**Form of Global Notes.**

Upon issue, the Notes shall be represented by an interim global note certificate (the “**Interim Global Certificate**”) substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule A, with such appropriate deletions, additions, substitutions and variations as the Trustee and the Issuer may approve and shall bear such distinguishing letters and numbers as the Trustee may approve, with such approval in each case to be conclusively deemed to have been given by the Trustee certifying such certificate. The Interim Global Certificate shall be replaced by a permanent global note certificate (the “**Permanent Global Certificate**”) substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule B, with such appropriate deletions, additions, substitutions and variations as the Trustee and the Issuer may approve and shall bear such distinguishing letters and numbers as the Trustee may approve, with such approval in each case to be conclusively deemed to have been given by the Trustee certifying such certificate, at such time as both of the following shall have occurred: (a) the delivery to CDS Clearing and [[Organization 3 Name]] of the Permanent Global Certificate and (b) 9:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on [[Date 4: Date]]. The Interim Global Certificate shall expire at the time (the “**Replacement Time**”) of its replacement by the Permanent Global Certificate in accordance with this section, and the Permanent Global Certificate shall come into force upon such expiry. For the avoidance of doubt and for purposes of Section 4.1 of the Base Indenture, and notwithstanding that the Permanent Global Certificate may be executed by the Issuer and certified and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with an order of the Issuer prior to the Effective Time, the Permanent Global Certificate (i) shall not be effective until the Replacement Time, and (ii) shall not represent an additional issuance of Notes by the Issuer and shall only, on or following the Replacement Time, represent the Notes that were represented by the Interim Global Certificate prior to the Replacement Time. 

^**Form of Definitive Notes.**

In the event that Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Base Indenture, such Definitive Notes shall be substantially in the form attached as Schedule A hereto (if issued prior to expiry of the Interim Global Certificate), but without the legend that refers to [[Organization 3 Name]], by the Issuer with respect to applicable legends, or in Schedule B hereto (if issued following expiry of the Interim Global Certificate), but without the legend referring to [[Organization 3 Name]] If Definitive Notes are issued prior to [[Date 4]], the Issuer shall provide the holders of such certificated securities with notice (in the form and manner required under the Trust Indenture) of their right to obtain replacement certificates for such certificated securities on [[Date 4]] and shall, upon request of any holder of such securities, issue a replacement certificate in the form attached as Schedule B hereto for such Definitive Notes.

^**Counterparts**

This Reopening Supplemental Indenture may be executed in several counterparts and delivered by facsimile, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be original and such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

This Series 1 Note is a single registered Note representing Cdn.$[[USD Value 1]] of the [[Percentage 1]]% Senior Unsecured Notes, Series 1 due [[Date 3]] of the Issuer issued under a trust indenture (the “**Base Indenture**”) dated [[Date 2]] made between the Issuer and [[Organization 2 Name]] of Canada (the “**Trustee**”), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated [[Date 2]] (the “**First Supplemental Indenture**”) made between the Issuer and the Trustee, and as further supplemented by a First (**Reopening**) Supplemental Indenture dated [[Date 1]] (the “**Reopening Indenture**”; the **Reopening** Indenture together with the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, the “**Trust Indenture**”). 

Reference is hereby expressly made to the Trust Indenture and all instruments supplemental thereto for a description of the terms and conditions upon which this Series 1 Note is issued and held and the rights and remedies of the holder of this Series 1 Note and of the Issuer and of the Trustee, all of which are incorporated by reference in this Series 1 Note and to all of which the holder of this Series 1 Note, by acceptance hereof, agrees. The provisions of this Series 1 Note are qualified in their entirety by the provisions of the Trust Indenture. A Noteholder may obtain from the Trustee a copy of the Trust Indenture on written request and upon payment of a reasonable copying charge. 

Interest payments will be made by the Issuer by electronic funds transfer or wire transfer (or other payment method as agreed by the Issuer and the Trustee) to the Depository or the Nominee on each Interest Payment Date, (except in case of payment at maturity, on redemption, repurchase or pursuant to a Change of Control Offer at which time payment of interest will be made only upon surrender of this Series 1 Note). The forwarding of such payments to the Depository or the Nominee shall satisfy and discharge the liability for interest upon this Series 1 Note to the extent of the sum represented thereby (plus the amount of any tax, assessment or other government charge required by law to be deducted or withheld). 

The Series 1 Notes are direct senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer. The Series 1 Notes rank equally and *pari passu* with each other and with the Notes of every other Series (regardless of their actual dates or terms of issue) and, subject to statutory preferred exceptions, with all other senior unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer for Borrowed Money, except as to any sinking fund which pertains exclusively to any particular indebtedness of the Issuer. 

This Series 1 Note has been unconditionally (except to the extent otherwise provided in the Trust Indenture) and irrevocably guaranteed as to the payment of principal, interest, Premium, if any, in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture by certain Guarantor(s). Any guarantee of the Series 1 Note is subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture, including Article 6 thereof. 

At any time and from time to time, the Issuer may purchase all or any of Series 1 Notes (which shall include purchase from or through an investment dealer or other market intermediary or by tender or by private contract), provided that no Event of Default would result from such purchase. 

The Issuer is required, subject to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture, unless the Issuer has exercised its optional right to redeem all of the Series 1 Notes, to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the option of the holder of Series 1 Notes, any part (equal to Cdn.$[[USD Value 3]] or an integral multiple thereof) of such holder’s Series 1 Notes, at a purchase price payable in cash equal to [[Percentage 4]]% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. 

The Principal Amount may become or be declared due before the Stated Maturity on the conditions, in the manner, with the effect and at the times set forth in the Trust Indenture. 

The Base Indenture contains provisions for the holding of meetings of holders of Notes and making resolutions passed at such meetings and instruments in writing signed by the holders of a specified percentage of the notes outstanding binding on all holders of Notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Base Indenture, subject to the provisions of the First Supplemental Indenture. 

This Series 1 Note may be transferred only upon compliance with the conditions prescribed in the Trust Indenture on one of the Registers kept at the principal offices of the Trustee in Toronto and at such other place or places, if any, and by such other Registrar or Registrars, if any, as the Issuer may designate, by the registered holder hereof or the holder’s legal representative or attorney duly appointed by an instrument in writing in form and execution satisfactory to the Trustee, and upon compliance with such reasonable requirements as the Trustee or other registrar may prescribe, and such transfer shall be duly noted hereon by the Trustee or other registrar. 

This Series 1 Note shall not become obligatory for any purpose until it shall have been certified by the manual signature of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture. 

This Series 1 Note and the Trust Indenture are governed by, and are to be construed and enforced with, the laws of the Province of Ontario.
