How the Plan Works The Plan provides a cash award for the achievement of goals in three key performance areas measured over a 12-month fi scal year. Success in these key areas helps American Greetings create shareholder value and ensure profi table growth over the long term. Your Award Opportunity Your **total target award** is established at the beginning of each fi scal year and will be communicated to you at that time. Your total target award is:  A percentage of your base earnings based on your job level  The award you would earn if each goal is achieved in each performance area The amount of the award you receive will increase or decrease based on actual performance in these three key areas: American Greetings will establish goals at the beginning of each fi scal year:  **Corporate goals** are developed by management and approved by the Board of Directors.  **Business unit goals** will be developed by each business unit based on its strategic direction, business opportunities and growth projections. These goals will also be approved by the Board of Directors.  **Individual performance goals** will be established with your manager through the Performance Management Process. At the end of the fi scal year, American Greetings determines the extent to which each goal has been met. Corporate Performance Business Unit Performance Individual Performance 3 E X A M P L E If base earnings are $[[USD Value 1: Number]] and target award percentage is [[Percentage 1: Number]]% of base earnings, total target award is $[[USD Value 2: Number]] **Base Earnings** ($[[USD Value 1]]) X Target Award % ([[Percentage 1]]%) **= Target Award** ($[[USD Value 3: Number]])

The weights for the corporate and individual components vary based on the potential the job role has to affect these results. The more senior the role, the greater the impact these individuals’ decisions have on the achievement of corporate objectives. Therefore, senior job levels have a heavier weighting on the corporate component and less senior job levels have more weighting assigned to the individual component.

^^^^^ 
Measuring Performance When American Greetings results for the fi scal year are fi nal, the company assesses achievement of goals in each performance area. Performance in each area will determine your actual Plan award. Awards for the corporate and business unit components are based on the fi nancial performance award scale. Individual awards are based on your performance rating. Performance Multiplier  How It’s Used in the Award Scale Performance multipliers are another way to think about the award scale. There is a relationship between performance and your actual award. For example, there is a 4:1 multiplier for the Corporate EPS measure. This means that for every [[Percentage 5: Number]]% increase or decrease in the percentage of goal achieved, the Corporate EPS target award will be adjusted up or down by [[Percentage 6: Number]]% to determine the actual award. Performance multipliers vary (see the Appendix on page 14 for complete list). Individual Performance **Total Award** Corporate Performance Business Unit + Performance + = Actual Award [[Percentage 7: Number]]% of Target [[Percentage 8: Number]]% of Target THRESHOLD X% of Target* [[Percentage 9: Number]]% of Target (No Award Below Threshold) Performance Above Goal Goal Below Goal Below Threshold G O A L MAXIMUM Financial Performance Award Scale Your actual award is based on fi scal year-end performance results using the award scale shown at left for corporate and business unit fi nancial measures. (See *Measuring Performance* table on page 6 for details.) To earn an award, performance in each area must at least reach **threshold**. There is no award for below-threshold performance. Achieving **goal** means American Greetings pays awards at target levels. Performance above goal will result in an increased award up to a **maximum** level. The award range for American Greetings fi nancial measures is [[Percentage 9]]%  [[Percentage 7]]% of target award. 5 * Varies by performance measure (see *Appendix* for details)

^^^^^ 
Corporate Component The corporate component consists of two parts:  Corporate Earnings per Share (EPS)  Corporate Total Revenue (Total Revenue) Each of these parts is weighted based on American Greetings current focus. The Plan is designed to emphasize the importance of our leaders’ abilities to infl uence EPS, while paying attention to how they can affect Total Revenue. The weighting applied to the total target award for the corporate component is:  [[Percentage 10: Number]]% for EPS  [[Percentage 1]]% for Total Revenue The potential award under the corporate component ranges from [[Percentage 9]]% to [[Percentage 7]]% of target award. Performance has a direct impact on actual award. For every [[Percentage 5]]% increase or decrease in the percentage of goal achieved:  EPS target award will be adjusted up or down by [[Percentage 6]]% to determine the actual award for this part of the corporate component.  Total Revenue target award will be adjusted up or down by [[Percentage 11: Number]]% to determine the actual award (Total Revenue goal is defi ned as a range between [[Percentage 12: Number]]% and [[Percentage 13: Number]]% of goal). You can earn up to [[Percentage 7]]% of the total target award for the corporate component based on EPS performance, Total Revenue performance or a combination of the two. 6 Performance Measures ME T R I C WH Y I T ‘ S IMP O RTA N T **Corporate Earnings per Share** (EPS) EPS shows how much profi t was generated on a per share basis. It communicates to the investment community the power the company has to make money. The higher our EPS, the greater value the company is able to provide its shareholders. **Corporate Total Revenue** (Total Revenue) When investing in a company, an investor wants to see it grow or improve over time. Management sets a Corporate Total Revenue goal each year to keep activities focused on growing the business year-over-year. **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes** (EBIT) EBIT is also known as operating income. It measures the business unit’s earnings before the deduction of interest payments and taxes. Refer to the section entitled *Key Terms* for defi nitions for these fi nancial measures. Total Revenue Goal Is a Range The Total Revenue portion of the corporate component has a goal defi ned as a range. That’s because American Greetings believes we have met our Total Revenue objective if we perform between [[Percentage 12]]% and [[Percentage 13]]% of goal.

**New Hires** If you are hired during the Plan year  defi ned as the American Greetings fi scal year ending [[Date 1: Date]]  and are eligible to participate in the Key Management Annual Incentive Plan, you will receive a prorated incentive award based on the period of time you participated in the Plan and your base earnings during that time. **Promotions and Transfers** If you are promoted or you move from one business unit to another during the Plan year, your individual target award, base earnings, business unit goal and corresponding performance multiplier may change. If any of these do change, your award will be calculated based on the targets, base earnings, plan provisions and actual performance for each business unit you participated in on a prorated basis and rounded to the nearest full month. **Termination** If you voluntarily or involuntarily leave American Greetings before the completion of the Plan year, you will forfeit your Key Management Annual Incentive Plan award for that fi scal year. **Retirement, Leave of Absence, Disability, Death** If your employment ends during the Plan year because you elect to retire after age 60, or if you take a leave of absence, suffer a permanent disability or die, your actual award will be prorated to the nearest full month based on the actual period you participated in the Plan during the year. An associate will be deemed to suffer a permanent disability only in the following circumstances: (A) where an associate is absent from employment with American Greetings due to his or her inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically Management Annual Incentive Plan and the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan will govern. **Questions** If you have questions about the Key Management Annual Incentive Plan and how it works, please contact your manager. Your manager will work with you to ensure you understand the Plan so you can maximize your annual award. It is the intent that incentive awards fall under the shortterm deferral rules of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code to exempt the payment of such Key Management Annual Incentive Plan benefi ts from the requirements of Section 409A. **Calculating Payouts** For computation purposes, fi nancial goals and actual performance results are rounded to the nearest $[[USD Value 21: Number]] The percent of the fi nancial goal achieved and the percent of target award earned is rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent. The actual incentive award is rounded to the nearest dollar. **Omnibus Incentive Plan** The Key Management Annual Incentive Plan is governed by the American Greetings Corporation 2007 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as such plan may be amended from time to time. In the event of a confl ict between the Key determinable physical or mental impairment, which either can be expected to result in death, or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months; or (B) where an associate is scheduled to receive income replacement benefi ts for a period of not less than 3 months under an accident and health plan covering American Greetings associate on account of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. **Incentive Award** Incentive awards earned in fi scal year 2011 will be paid to participants within two and one-half months following the end of fi scal 2011, typically within 60 days after the end of the fi scal year. Plan awards are subject to normal tax withholding at a standardized rate and will be deposited to a bank account of your choice.

\centered SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER  ADDENDUM TO INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE COMPONENT OF  FY2011 AMERICAN GREETINGS KEY MANAGEMENT ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN 

**INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE**  
Notwithstanding the description of the Individual Performance component included in the booklet (the “Plan Booklet”) outlining the Fiscal 2011 Key Management Annual Incentive Plan, the Individual Performance component of American Greetings Key Management Annual Incentive Plan for all Senior Executive Officers of American Greetings, consisting of the Corporation’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice Presidents and other Section 16 officers (collectively the “Senior Executive Officers”) is modified by this Addendum as follows: 

Specific award percentages for the individual performance component are replaced with award ranges, thereby giving managers more discretion to adjust the percentage of the individual award based on an individual’s performance.

Senior Executive Officers who receive an “Exceeds Expectations (Manager Discretion)” performance rating will earn between [[Percentage 33]]% and [[Percentage 7]]% of their target award under the individual performance component. Those who receive an “Exceeds Expectations” performance rating will earn between [[Percentage 8]]% and [[Percentage 33]]% of their target award under the individual performance component. And those who receive a “Meets Expectations” performance rating will earn between [[Percentage 2]]% and [[Percentage 8]]% of their target award under the individual performance component.

As with all participants of the Key Management Annual Incentive Plan, at the end of the fiscal year, managers assess each Senior Executive Officer’s performance compared to other participants. Managers determine the degree to which participants achieved the performance objectives that had been defined at the beginning of the year. 

Managers rank participants based on their relative performance and determine actual performance ratings and individual performance awards based on these rankings and the targeted distribution of performance ratings. 

For Senior Executive Officers, the targeted distribution of participants for the “Exceeds Expectations (Manager Discretion)” performance rating is [[Percentage 9]]% to [[Percentage 1]]%; the targeted distribution for the “Exceeds Expectation” performance rating is [[Percentage 4]]% to [[Percentage 3]]%; the targeted distribution for the “Meets Expectations” performance rating is [[Percentage 32]]%; and the targeted distribution for the “Improvement Expected / Performance Below Peer Level” is [[Percentage 1]]%. (See chart on the following page.)

Senior Executive Officers who receive an “Exceeds Expectations (Manager Discretion)” performance rating will receive between [[Percentage 33]]% and [[Percentage 7]]% of their target individual award, as determined by his or her manager.

As with other participants, Senior Executive Officers who receive an “Improvement Expected / Performance Below Peer Level” rating will not receive an individual performance award and will only receive [[Percentage 2]]% of any award otherwise earned under the corporate and business unit components.

As with other participants, if corporate EPS performance is below the performance threshold, only those Senior Executive Officers with a performance rating of “Exceeds Expectations” or “Exceeds Expectations (Manager Discretion)” may receive awards for the individual performance measure. 

Participants, including Senior Executive Officers, who receive an “Exceeds Expectations” or “Exceeds Expectations (Manager Discretion)” performance rating will receive an award for the individual performance component as shown in the table below.

Senior Executives who receive a “Meets Expectations” or “Improvement Expected / Below Peer Level” performance rating will not receive any portion of the individual performance award.

The schedule below shows how individual awards will be adjusted based on individual performance.
