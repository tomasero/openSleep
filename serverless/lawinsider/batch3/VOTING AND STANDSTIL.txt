Section 8.9  Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.2(c), this Agreement may not be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of law or otherwise. 

Section 8.10  Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

^^^^^ 
^Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

^^Unless the context otherwise requires, words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. 

^^The words “include,” includes” and “including,” when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words “without limitation.” 

^^The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 8.15  Capacity as a Stockholder. The Stockholders do not make any agreement or understanding herein in their capacity as being associated with a director of the Company. The Stockholders make their agreements and understandings herein solely

in their capacities as the record holder and beneficial owner of the Subject Shares and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by a Representative of a Stockholder in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company.
