Seller shall, at Seller’s sole cost and expense, prior to the Closing Date, satisfy any objections with respect to which Purchaser delivered written notice in accordance with the foregoing, and provide to Purchaser such endorsements to the Title Commitment as are necessary to delete any and all commercially reasonable matters objected to by Purchaser. If Seller fails to cure such objections, Purchaser may elect as its sole remedy to: (a) terminate this Agreement with the Deposit plus interest being returned to Purchaser; or (b) accept such title as Seller can deliver, with no reduction in the Purchase Price other than with respect to Monetary Liens.

As used herein, “to Seller’s knowledge” shall be deemed to mean the actual knowledge of [[Person 2 First Name]] [[Person 2 Last Name]], property manager. Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that [[Person 2 First Name]] [[Person 2 Last Name]] is the person most familiar with the Property and most knowledgable with respect to the matters contained in the representations and warranties set forth herein. 

Purchaser represents that it is a limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and all documents, including this Agreement, executed or to be executed by Purchaser, which are to be delivered to Seller prior to or at Closing, have been or will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by Purchaser and are or will be legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser, and will not violate any provisions of any agreement to which Purchaser is a party or to which it is subject; and that Purchaser has full right, power and authority, without the necessity, consent or approval of any other person or entity, to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder. 

It is a condition precedent of Purchaser’s and Seller’s obligations to close hereunder that all of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement shall continue to be true in all material respects as of the Closing Date and said representations and warranties shall be deemed to be restated and affirmed as of the Closing Date, as if first made on the Closing Date, without the necessity of the execution of any document with regard thereto. All of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and each party’s liability therefor shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that Seller’s representations and warranties with respect to the Tenant Estoppel Matters, Ground Lease Estoppel Matters, and Master Lease Estoppel Matters shall not survive Closing. In the event that any representations or warranties should prove to be untrue prior to Closing, the party to whom the representations and warranties were given shall notify the party who gave the representations and warranties of any such misrepresentations or breach of warranty and such party shall have five (5) business days thereafter to cure such misrepresentation or breach of warranty. In the event any such misrepresentation or breach of warranty is not cured prior to the Closing Date, the aggrieved party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the other party and receive the Deposit plus interest or may pursue an action for damages if such misrepresentation or breach of warranty is discovered following the Closing.

Such right of entry shall not unreasonably interfere with Seller’s business or the business of any tenants on the Property, and Purchaser will coordinate its activities with a designated representative of Seller. Upon reasonable prior notice to Seller, Purchaser may contact any tenants of the Property; provided that Seller shall have the right to be present during any tenant interviews. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any and all loss, liability, costs, claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action, and suits (including without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees whether incurred at or prior to trial or on appeal) arising out of or in any manner related to the exercise by Purchaser of Purchaser’s right of entry under this Section 8. Purchaser’s obligation to indemnify and hold Seller harmless shall survive Closing or any termination of this Agreement for a period of one (1) year from Closing or termination. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall have a period of thirty (30) days from the Effective Date of this Agreement in which to review and examine the Property (the “Feasibility Period”). Seller shall deliver the materials described in **Exhibit “8”** attached hereto to Purchaser no later than three (3) days from the Effective Date of this Agreement. At any time prior to the expiration of the Feasibility Period, Purchaser may terminate this Agreement if, in its sole discretion, Purchaser determines that the Property is not acceptable to Purchaser. Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice thereof to Seller within the time period provided, whereupon the Deposit plus interest shall be refunded in full to Purchaser and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other under this Agreement except for those provisions which specifically survive the termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated, Purchaser agrees, upon payment by Seller to Purchaser (at Seller’s sole election) of the actual cost of such items, to provide Seller with copies of any and all surveys, environmental audits and soil reports obtained by Purchaser during its due diligence review of the Property, but specifically excluding Purchaser’s work product and/or analyses.

Each Earn-Out Payment shall be reduced by commissions paid by Purchaser pursuant to the New Leasing Agreement as set forth above and monies spent by Purchaser for tenant improvements to space in the Property pursuant to new leases, subleases or expansions of existing leases, all for the year during which an Earn-Out Payment is due. For purposes of this Section 10.5, “Property NOI” shall be defined as all rents and other revenues received in the ordinary course from the Property, but excluding any income or revenues related to the exercise of any early termination or contraction options, pre-paid rents and revenues and security deposits, except to the extent applied in satisfaction of tenants’ obligations for rent, and “Base Property NOI” shall be the Property NOI as mutually determined and agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser in writing as of the Closing Date. The terms of this Section 10.5 shall survive Closing.

^^Both parties agree to execute and deliver at Closing such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably required by the parties’ counsel, the Title Company and the counsel of Purchaser’s lender(s) to properly consummate this transaction. 

^^Escrow Closing. Closing shall occur through an escrow with Escrow Agent (the “Escrow”) established, in accordance with this Section 12.5, upon receipt by Escrow Agent of this Agreement executed by Seller and Purchaser. 

12.5.1 Escrow. Upon receipt of the Agreement, Escrow Agent shall acknowledge the opening of Escrow and its agreement to act as the Escrow Agent hereunder by: (1) executing the Consent of Escrow Agent attached hereto; and (2) delivering a copy of the executed Consent to Seller and Purchaser. 

12.5.2 Delivery of Documents. On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver and Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent originals, undated but executed and acknowledged where required, of the closing documents (the “Closing Documents”) required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, Purchaser shall deliver, on or before the Closing Date, the balance of the Purchase Price, in immediately available federal funds, to be held by the Escrow Agent in an interest-bearing account satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser. In determining adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided herein, a preliminary closing statement will be prepared by the Escrow Agent at least three (3) business days prior to Closing, with the assistance of Seller and Purchaser, for determining the amount of funds Purchaser is required to be placed in escrow. 

12.5.3 Term of Escrow. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Purchase Price and the Closing Documents in trust until receipt of Seller’s and Purchaser’s written instructions to close and deliver the Closing Documents together with a final closing statement signed by Purchaser and Seller (all as provided in Section 12.5.4 below). 

12.5.4 Recordation and Release of Escrow Documents. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall provide to the Escrow Agent an authorization to proceed with Closing upon an executed final Closing Statement between Seller and Purchaser. 

Upon receipt of the foregoing authorizations, the Escrow Agent shall promptly do the following:

^^^disburse funds to Seller (and any excess funds to Purchaser) in accordance with the Closing Statement and any accompanying instructions; 

^^^deliver counterpart originals of the Closing Documents (and file-stamped copies of recorded documents) to Seller and Purchaser; and 

^^^issue the Owner’s Policy of Title Insurance in favor of Purchaser in the amount of the Purchase Price, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions and as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement. 

12.5.5 Termination of Escrow. If the Escrow terminates for failure of Closing to occur within one hundred twenty (120) days after the establishment of the Escrow, then absent a written agreement between Purchaser and Seller to extend the Escrow, this Agreement, together with the Escrow, shall terminate, the Closing Documents shall be returned to Seller (all of which shall be deemed null and void), the Purchase Price and Deposit shall be promptly returned to Purchaser, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder except for obligations specifically surviving termination of this Agreement. 

12.5.6 Fees and Costs. All fees, costs and expenses incurred by Escrow Agent in administering the Escrow shall be paid as set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly and severally bear all costs and expenses of any legal proceedings arising out of the administration of the Escrow and the prevailing party in any such proceeding shall be entitled to the recovery of all reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs from the non-prevailing party. 

12.5.7 Provisions Concerning Escrow Agent. Upon distribution of the Closing Documents held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved and released from any further liability or obligation hereunder. In the event of a dispute arising out of the administration of the Escrow or as to the right of any of the parties in or to the Closing Documents or the disposition thereof, or in the event the Escrow Agent, in good faith, is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, refuse to take any action hereunder, so long as such disagreement continues or such doubt exists. The Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in any way to any person for its failure or refusal to act, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to refrain from acting until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) all differences and all doubt shall have been resolved by agreement among all of the interested parties and the Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof by written instrument signed by all such parties. 

^TERMINATION; DEFAULT; REMEDIES. 

^^Except as otherwise set forth below, in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, the Deposit plus interest shall be returned to Purchaser and the parties shall have no further obligations one to the other. 

^^In the event of any material default on the part of Seller under this Agreement which continues for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from Purchaser (except that no notice shall be required for default under any obligation to be performed at Closing), Purchaser shall have the right, as Purchaser’s sole exclusive remedy, to either (i) terminate this Agreement and obtain a refund of its Deposit plus interest, together with reimbursement of Purchaser’s actually incurred out of pocket costs in conjunction with the Agreement, up to a maximum of Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 3: Number]]); or (ii) bring an action for specific performance to cause Seller to convey the Property to Purchaser pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Seller shall have no additional liability for damages on account thereof.  

^^In the event of any material default on the part of Purchaser under this Agreement which continues for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from Seller (except that no notice shall be required for default under any obligation to be performed at Closing), Seller shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and receive immediate full cash payment of the Deposit plus interest as liquidated damages and the parties hereto will have no further rights, duties or obligations to the other as a result of this Agreement. Retention of the Deposit shall be Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy hereunder in the event of such breach by Purchaser, and Seller hereby waives all other remedies, including specific performance.  

^RISK OF LOSS. Risk of loss to the Property or any part thereof shall remain with the Seller until the Closing Date. 

^COVENANTS OF SELLER PRIOR TO CLOSING. Seller covenants and agrees with Purchaser with respect to the Property that, from and after the Effective Date through the Closing, unless Purchaser’s prior written consent to any unpermitted action hereunder is first obtained, Seller will (except as specifically provided to the contrary herein): 

^^Except as provided in this Agreement, not transfer any part of the Property or create on the Property any easements or mortgages which will survive the Closing or permit any changes to the zoning or other land use classification of the Land; 

^^Not enter into any new contracts or other agreements (other than new Leases, which shall be governed by Section 10.3) regarding the Property (other than contracts in the ordinary and usual course of business and which are cancelable by the owner of the Property without penalty upon the earlier of the Closing Date or within thirty (30) days after giving notice thereof); 

^^Continue to insure, operate, maintain, repair and market and lease the Property in a manner consistent with Seller’s practices prior to the Effective Date; 

^^Comply in all material respects with the terms of the Ground Lease, the Leases and Contracts and any easement or other agreements affecting the Property; and 

^^Immediately provide Purchaser with copies of any notices to or from the Ground Lessor, a Tenant and any notice from any Tenant or Ground Lessor, any notices of default to or from any party to any Contract and any notices of violation or noncompliance with applicable law or condemnation or rezoning notices from any governmental authority. 

^PRORATIONS. Prorations shall be made as of the Closing Date. 

^^Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes. Real estate and personal property taxes, if any, shall be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. of the Closing Date. In the event that the taxes for the year of the Closing are unknown, the tax proration will be based upon such taxes for the prior year and such taxes for the year of the Closing shall be reprorated and adjusted within sixty (60) days of the date when the tax bill for the year of the Closing is received and the actual amount of taxes is known. Seller shall be responsible for any retroactive increase, “recoupment” or similar taxes or assessments payable with respect to any time period prior to Closing. Any and all refunds, credits, claims or rights to appeal respecting the amount of any real property taxes or other taxes or assessments charged in connection with the Property for any period after Closing shall belong to Purchaser following the Closing. 

^^Utilities and Insurance. Utility bills or charges, where applicable, shall be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. of the Closing Date. To the extent reasonably possible, Seller and Purchaser shall have utility meters read the day preceding the Closing Date and Seller shall be responsible for paying all utility bills or charges which accrued against the Property prior to 12:01 A.M. of the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall be required to pay all utility bills accruing against the Property on or subsequent to 12:01 A.M. of the Closing Date, with any charge for which a reading could not be made as of the day preceding the Closing Date being prorated as of 12:01 A.M. of the Closing Date using an estimate based on the most recent reading for such utility, subject to readjustment upon receipt of actual bills. Purchaser shall secure its own insurance on the Property as of the Closing Date, and Seller shall cancel all existing insurance policies as of the Closing Date. Purchaser and Seller shall, before and after the Closing, reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with this Section 16.2. 

^^Income and Expenses. The parties agree that, except as otherwise specifically stated elsewhere in this Agreement, all income and expenses (including, without limitation, owners’ association or similar dues, fees and assessments) of the Property are intended to be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be deemed the owner of the Property, for the purpose of such calculation, for the entire Closing Date. Income shall include all revenue of Seller derived from the operation of the Property, including all rents and pass-throughs collected from Tenants. Expenses shall include all expenses from the operation of the Property. Income shall appear on the closing statement as a credit to Purchaser. Expenses actually paid by Seller prior to the Closing in payment for a period subsequent to the Closing shall appear on the closing statement as a credit to Seller. 

^^Rents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 16.3 above, rents under the Leases (collectively, “Rents”), shall be addressed in the manner set forth in this Section 16.4. Purchaser will receive a credit at Closing for all rents collected by Seller prior to the Closing Date and allocable to the period from and after the Closing Date based upon the actual number of days in the month. No credit shall be given Seller for accrued and unpaid rent or any other non-current sums due from tenants until these sums are paid, and Seller shall retain the right to collect any such rent provided Seller does not sue to evict any tenants or terminate any Leases. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller after the Closing Date to collect any rent under the Leases which has accrued as of the Closing Date; *provided, however,* Purchaser shall not be obligated to sue any tenants or exercise any legal remedies under the Leases or to incur any expense over and above its own regular collection expenses. All payments collected from tenants after the Closing Date shall first be applied to the month in which the Closing occurs, then to any rent due to Purchaser for the period after the Closing Date and finally to any rent due to Seller for the periods prior to Closing Date; *provided, however,* notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller collects any payments from tenants after the Closing Date through its own collection efforts, Seller may first apply such payments to rent due Seller for the period prior to the Closing Date. 

^^Security Deposits. All security deposits, Tenant deposits for construction work and prepaid Rent, if any, including, without limitation, transferable letters of credit held by or under the control of Seller, as required by the Leases and set forth on **Exhibit “1.4”** or for Leases entered into prior to Closing, shall be paid or credited to Purchaser as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall, with respect to all matters arising or accruing after the Closing, assume all liability therefor. Seller shall not further offset all or any portion of such security deposits or prepaid Rent Subsequent to the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i.e., having the requisite transfer documentation at the Closing and, within five (5) business days after Closing, paying any applicable transfer fee) to effectuate the transfer of any letters of credit deposited by Tenants as security for their obligations under any of the applicable Leases and, if necessary, as a result of a default by such Tenant between the Closing Date and such transfer, to cooperate with Purchaser to make a demand on the issuing bank to draw on the letter of credit. 

^^Leasing Commissions, Tenant Improvements, and Other Concessions. All unpaid Lease commissions, tenant improvement costs, and other concessions, including but not limited to all Lease related costs, free rent, moving allowances, and cash payments (collectively, the “Leasing Costs”) (except for Master Lease Future Leasing Costs), incurred by Seller in connection with the Master Lease or any Leases executed before the Effective Date shall be the responsibility of Seller and shall be paid or credited to Purchaser at the Closing; provided, however, that Purchaser shall assume at Closing any Leasing Costs related to Leases executed after the Effective Date as well as all Master Lease Future Leasing Costs (“Purchaser’s Assumed Leasing Costs”). 

^^Sales Tax. Seller agrees to pay to the appropriate taxing authority sales tax collected by Seller in connection with Rent received by Seller under the Leases for the month in which the Closing occurs promptly after the Closing and to provide written proof of same to Purchaser within forty five (45) days after the Closing (or the date Seller actually receives any Delinquent Rent). Seller hereby defends, indemnifies and holds Purchaser harmless from and against any and all suits, claims, liabilities and expenses for any tax, levy, assessment or surcharge relating to the Leases prior to the proration date. 

^^Operating Expense Reconciliations. To the extent that tenants are reimbursing the landlord for common area maintenance and other operating expenses (collectively, “CAM Charge(s)”), CAM Charges shall be prorated at Closing as of the Closing Date on a lease-by-lease basis with each party being entitled to receive a portion of the CAM Charges payable under each Lease for the CAM Lease Year (as defined below) in which Closing occurs, which portion shall be equal to the actual CAM Charges incurred during the party’s respective periods of ownership of the Property during the CAM Lease Year. As used herein, the term “CAM Lease Year” means the twelve (12) month period as to which annual CAM Charges are owed under each Lease. Seller shall be responsible for the CAM reconciliation on a lease-by-lease basis for their ownership period within the CAM Lease Year up to, but not including, the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for the CAM reconciliation on a lease-by-lease basis for their ownership period within the CAM Lease Year including the Closing Date. In the event of any expenses, i.e. property taxes, where a proration was based on an estimate for the year of Closing, a post close “true up” will be performed for the actual expense to determine Seller and Purchaser obligation for their ownership period for the year of Closing. Each party will be responsible for any CAM “true up” necessary to the extent that any Lease provides for a “true up”. 

^^Calculation / Re-prorations. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser no later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date an estimated closing statement which shall set forth all costs payable, and the prorations and credits provided for in this Agreement and to the extent Seller does not timely deliver the estimated closing statement to Purchaser, Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Closing Date by the number of days Seller is delinquent in delivering such estimated closing statement to Purchaser. Any item which cannot be finally prorated because of the unavailability of information shall be tentatively prorated on the basis of the best data then available and adjusted when the information is available in accordance with this subsection. Purchaser shall notify Seller within two (2) days after its receipt of such estimated closing statement of any items which Purchaser disputes and the parties shall attempt in good faith to reconcile any differences with the assistance of the Escrow Agent not later than one (1) day before the Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing in the preceding sentence shall serve to delay the Closing Date. The estimated closing statement as adjusted as aforesaid and approved in writing by the parties shall be referred to therein as the “Closing Statement”. If the prorations and credits made under the Closing Statement shall prove to be incorrect or incomplete for any reason, then either party shall be entitled to an adjustment to correct the same; provided, however, that any adjustment shall be made, if at all, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date except with respect to CAM Charges, taxes and assessments, in which case such adjustment shall be made within sixty (60) days after the information necessary to perform such adjustment is available (provided, however, that Seller and Purchaser shall complete their respective CAM reconciliations and make such final adjustment for CAM Charges no later than [[Date 7: Date]]), and if a party fails to request an adjustment to the Closing Statement by a written notice delivered to the other party within the applicable period set forth above (such notice to specify in reasonable detail the items within the Closing Statement that such party desires to adjust and the reasons for such adjustment), then the prorations and credits set forth in the Closing Statement shall be binding and conclusive against such party. 

^^Indemnification. Purchaser and Seller shall each indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other harmless from and against any claim in any way arising from the matters for which the other receives a credit or otherwise assumes responsibility pursuant to this Section. 

^^Survival. The provisions of this Section 16 shall survive the Closing under this Agreement until [[Date 7]]. 

^NOTICES. All notices, demands and requests and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to be delivered when received, if delivered in person, by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (such as UPS or Federal Express) or by telecopier or e-mail, or the earlier of when actually received or forty-eight (48) hours after the deposit thereof in a regularly maintained receptacle for the United States mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the parties at the following addresses:

^FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION. 

^^Fire or Other Casualty. If the Property or any part thereof is damaged by fire or other casualty prior to the Closing Date which would cost in excess of Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($[[USD Value 4: Number]]) to repair, or take longer than one hundred eighty (180) days to repair (as determined by an insurance adjuster selected by the insurance carriers), it shall constitute a “material adverse change” to the Property allowing Purchaser to terminate this Agreement by giving Seller written notice within ten (10) days after such determination. If Purchaser does not elect to terminate this Agreement with respect to the Property, or the cost of repair is determined by said adjuster to be less than Fifty Thousand and No/100 ($[[USD Value 4]]) and the time necessary to repair such damage is less than one hundred eighty (180) days, then the Closing shall take place as herein provided with a credit against the Purchase Price equal to the cost to repair such damage and the cost of rent replacement, if disrupted; provided that in the event of any uninsured loss, the credit for the cost to repair the damage will not exceed Fifty Thousand and No/100 ($[[USD Value 4]]). 

^^Condemnation. If any portion of the Property is taken in eminent domain proceedings after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing such that Purchaser would reasonably expect to be unable to operate the Property as it is presently operated, or if, as a result thereof, any Tenant would be entitled to terminate its Lease, it shall constitute a “material adverse change” to the Property allowing either party to terminate this Agreement by giving the other written notice within ten (10) days after such determination. If neither party elects to terminate this Agreement with respect to the Property or if the taking does not constitute a “material adverse change”, then the Closing shall take place as herein provided without abatement of the Purchase Price, and Seller shall deliver or assign to Purchaser on the Closing Date, all of Seller’s right, title and interest in and to all condemnation awards paid or payable to Seller. 

^EQUITY PURCHASE OPTION. 

^^Grant of Option; Physician Investors. 

^^Purchaser hereby grants to Seller an irrevocable option to purchase (the “Equity Purchase Option”) at Closing up to twenty-five percent ([[Percentage 6: Number]]%) of the membership interests (the “Equity Interests”) in Purchaser’s assignee (“[[Organization 6 Name]]”). Seller shall form a new limited liability company (“NewCo”) which shall be managed by Seller for so long as NewCo owns any Equity Interests, and the Equity Interests shall be purchased by NewCo. 

^^From and after the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller shall have the right to sell membership interests in NewCo to physician tenants of the Property. Seller shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to securities laws, rules and regulations, in connection with selling membership interests in NewCo. All materials distributed by Seller or its employees, agents, or affiliates in connection with the sale of membership interests in NewCo shall clearly state that either Seller or NewCo is the offeror of the membership interests, and shall expressly state that neither Purchaser, [[Organization 6 Name]], nor any of their affiliates are offering the membership interests for sale. Seller agrees to, and agrees to cause NewCo to, indemnify and hold Purchaser and [[Organization 6 Name]], and the affiliates, members, officers, directors, and employees of Purchaser and [[Organization 6 Name]] (collectively, “Purchaser Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any suit, claim, demand, liability, cost or expense asserted against any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (including, without limitation, and by way of example only, reasonable attorney’s fees, disbursements and amounts paid in settlement of claims) arising out of the sale of membership interests in NewCo.
