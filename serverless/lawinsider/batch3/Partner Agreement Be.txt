The Limited Partner is hereby designated as an “Original Partner” (for purposes of the Limited Partnership Agreement) by the General Partner and the rights, duties and obligations of the Limited Partner under the Limited Partnership Agreement following his admission to the Partnership shall, except to the extent modified by the terms of this Agreement, be the same as those of the previously admitted Original Partners thereunder. Following the Admission Date, the Limited Partner shall be eligible to participate in any benefit plans or programs sponsored or maintained by the Partnership and its Affiliates (including, without limitation, any life insurance, disability insurance and liability insurance), on the same general terms provided to other Individual Limited Partners.

Class D-1 Common Units are reallocated thereunder, each Class D-1 Common Unit shall automatically convert into a Class A Common Unit upon such reallocation but will remain subject to the same vesting requirements as the Class D-1 Common Units of the Limited Partner had been before his Withdrawal.

^^The failure by any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement, or to require at any time performance by any party hereto of any provision hereof, shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof, or the right of any party hereto thereafter to enforce each and every such provision in accordance with its terms. 

^^The Limited Partner acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any conflict between the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement and the terms of this Agreement with respect to the rights and obligations of the Limited Partner, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
