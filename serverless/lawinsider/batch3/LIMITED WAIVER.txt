^^^ \centered **LIMITED WAIVER** 

This Limited Waiver (this “Waiver”) is made as of [[Date 1: Date]] (the “Effective Date”), by and between [[Borrower]], a [[State of Formation: State]] [[Organization: EntityType]] (“Borrower”) and [[Organization 1 Name]], a Pennsylvania chartered bank (“Lender”). Unless otherwise set forth herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning given such terms in the Loan Documents (defined below).

WHEREAS, in connection with a loan from Lender to Borrower (the “Loan”), the Borrower executed and delivered to Lender that certain Promissory Note (“Note”), that certain Loan Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) and that certain Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge”), each dated as of [[Date 2: Date]] (this Waiver, the Note, the Loan Agreement, the Pledge and any other documents executed by Borrower in connection with the Loan, in each case as amended through the date hereof, are collectively herein referred to as the “Loan Documents”);

WHEREAS, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC Letter”) issued a letter dated [[Date 3: Date]], to [[Organization 2 Name]] County (the “Bank”) requiring that the Bank achieve and maintain, by [[Date 4: Date]], a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of not less than [[Percentage 1: Number]]%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of not less than [[Percentage 2: Number]]%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than [[Percentage 3: Number]]%;

WHEREAS, as of [[Date 5: Date]], Bank’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was below [[Percentage 1]]%, but its Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios were above the thresholds required by the OCC Letter;

WHEREAS, Section 5.07 of the Loan Agreement requires the Borrower and the Bank to remain in compliance with any formal or informal regulatory enforcement action or guidance, including, without limitation, to the extent compliance is required as of a particular date, the Regulatory Letters (as defined in the Loan Agreement);

WHEREAS, Section 5.08(b) of the Loan Agreement requires the Borrower and the Bank to have sufficient capital to satisfy all applicable regulatory requirements in order to be considered well capitalized by regulatory authorities, and in order to satisfy any additional requirements imposed by formal or informal regulatory action; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Loan Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Lender is willing to waive compliance with Section 5.08(b) of the Loan Agreement as it relates to the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio being less than [[Percentage 1]]% as of [[Date 5]] on the limited basis set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and fully intending to be legally bound by this Waiver, the parties hereto agree as follows:

. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Documents, as applicable.

^Limited Waiver. Pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Loan Agreement and subject to the limitations contained herein, the undersigned Lender hereby waives Borrower’s obligation to maintain a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least [[Percentage 1]]% as of [[Date 5]] pursuant to Section 5.07 and Section 5.08(b) of the Loan Agreement; provided, however, that such waiver shall be conditioned on Borrower maintaining, at all times while this Waiver is in effect, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least [[Percentage 4: Number]]% (the “Waiver Condition”). The foregoing waiver shall automatically and without further action terminate if the Waiver Condition shall cease to be satisfied.

^Termination. This Waiver shall terminate automatically upon the earlier of the submission of the Bank’s Report of Condition and Income (the “Call Report”) for the quarter ended [[Date 6: Date]] with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or [[Date 7: Date]].
